  "background": "The migration of the anadromous life history form of Redband Trout was eliminated from the upper Columbia River with the construction of Grand Coulee Dam in 1939, and likelyisolated populations and habitats of potamodromous Redband Trout. Comprehensive habitat assessments in riverine systems that contain Redband Trout populationshave not been completed in theSpokane River, Lake Roosevelt and the upper Columbia River. This protocol evaluatesRedband Trout habitatin riverine systems within the upper Columbia River basin. Habitat assessments will allow managers to better understand Redband Trout population characteristics as well as identify habitat factors that may influence populations. Methods used will be dependent on the limitations of data collectionwithin that watershed.",
