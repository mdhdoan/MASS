  "abstract": " The Environmental Assessment Program (EAP) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines methods for evaluating water quality at Freshwater Ambient Monitoring stations. This document covers the processes of preparing runs, collecting samples, measuring parameters, and preserving and shipping them. Quality assurance and control procedures are also included.\n\nThe standard tests performed include temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total suspended solids, fecal coliform bacteria, ammonia, nitrate plus nitrite, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, metals, and stage height. Additional tests may be carried out on request for alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total organic carbon (TOC), filtered total phosphorus, filtered total nitrogen, and suspended sediment concentration (SSC).\n\nMonthly monitoring is the standard practice for all ambient stations, while metals are checked every other month at only a few. This long-term ambient stream monitoring is necessary to ensure the health and safety of freshwater ecosystems, identifying any potential issues or changes in water quality over time. By following this SOP, we can accurately measure and analyze water quality data to address any concerns related to water pollution, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and protecting the environment."

  "description": " This Environmental Assessment Program (EAP) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the techniques utilized for gathering, maintaining, assessing, and analyzing water quality at Freshwater Ambient Monitoring stations. The document delves into the detailed procedures employed for run preparation, sample collection, measurement, processing, preservation, and shipment.\n\nThe EAP SOP encompasses a standard array of samples to be collected, measured, or processed: temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total suspended solids, fecal coliform bacteria, ammonia, nitrate plus nitrite, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, metals, and stage height.\n\nAdditional samples may be obtained on a special study request basis: alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total organic carbon (TOC), filtered total phosphorus, filtered total nitrogen, and suspended sediment concentration (SSC). The monitoring frequency for ambient stations is typically monthly. However, dissolved metals are analyzed at only a few stations every other month.\n\nThe EAP SOP focuses on long-term ambient stream monitoring and adheres to quality assurance and quality control procedures. It meticulously covers the intricacies of run preparation, which may include securing necessary permits, ensuring proper equipment calibration, and preparing sampling containers. Sample collection entails following a predefined protocol for each parameter, such as employing correct sample volumes, collecting at designated depths, and preserving samples with appropriate chemicals or temperatures.\n\nMeasurement procedures involve using recognized and approved analytical techniques for assessing temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total suspended solids, and other parameters mentioned above. Processing encompasses treatments like filtration or centrifugation for certain samples to remove impurities or prepare them for analysis.\n\nPreservation techniques ensure the integrity of samples during transportation and storage. This may include refrigeration, addition of preservatives, or securing containers with tight-fitting lids. Lastly, shipment procedures outline methods for safely transporting samples to laboratories for further assessment.\n\nIn summary, this EAP SOP provides a comprehensive guide for conducting water quality assessments at Freshwater Ambient Monitoring stations through detailed descriptions of stream monitoring techniques, including sample collection, measurement, processing, preservation, and shipment, adhering to quality assurance and quality control procedures."
