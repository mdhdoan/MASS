  "abstract": " This text describes a method for measuring the width and height of a river or channel bank using a laser rangefinder and a surveying string. When the channel is too wide for the bank tape to lay flat, this method becomes necessary. By shooting width distances with the handheld laser and using the surveying string for depth measurements, this technique allows for accurate measurements in wider channels where other methods might not work effectively. This solution helps ensure precise data collection for various applications such as floodplain mapping or river engineering projects.\n\nCode-free summary: To measure wide river or channel banks, use a laser rangefinder and surveying string. Shoot width distances with the laser and assist with depth measurements using the string. This method is crucial when bank tape bows in the middle of wide channels. It results in accurate data collection for floodplain mapping and river engineering projects."

  "description": " In order to determine bankfull width and height accurately, utilize a laser rangefinder for measurements in channels that are sufficiently wide for the bank tape to bend in the center. This procedure involves employing handheld lasers to record width distances and relying on a surveying string as an aid for depth assessments.\n\nMore technically, when dealing with a channel that is too broad for the bank tape to keep its straight shape, follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain a laser rangefinder instrument. This device is specifically designed for measuring distances with great precision.\n2. Position yourself at an appropriate location along the water's edge, ensuring you have a clear line of sight to where you will be taking measurements.\n3. Use the handheld laser function on your rangefinder to measure the width distances between opposing banks at several points along the channel. Ensure that these points cover the entire width of the channel and are evenly spaced. Record each measurement obtained.\n4. For depth assessments, employ a surveying string. Attach one end to a fixed point on the bank and stretch it across the channel to the opposite bank. Mark the string at regular intervals, such as every 0.5 meters or 1 meter, depending on your desired level of detail.\n5. Using your laser rangefinder, measure the vertical distance from each marked point on the surveying string to the water's surface. Record these measurements for further analysis.\n6. Repeat this process at multiple locations across the channel width to ensure a comprehensive understanding of bankfull width and height variations.\n7. Analyze the data obtained from both width and depth measurements to determine the bankfull width and height at each location, as well as any trends or patterns that may exist within the given waterway."

  "constraints": " The given text describes a method for measuring bankfull width and height using a laser rangefinder and a surveying string. Based on the information provided, here are some constraints that can be identified:\n\n1. Wide channels: This method is applicable to channels that are so wide that the bank tape bows in the middle.\n2. Use of a handheld laser: The method involves using a handheld laser rangefinder to measure width distances.\n3. Use of a surveying string: The method also involves using a surveying string to assist with depth measurements.\n4. Depth measurements: Depth measurements need to be taken in addition to width measurements.\n\nThe constraints are stated as follows in the text:\n\n1. \"If a channel is so wide that the bank tape bows in the middle\" - This indicates that the method is only applicable to wide channels.\n2. \"Use the handheld laser to shoot width distances\" - This states that a handheld laser rangefinder is used for measuring widths.\n3. \"and a surveying string to assist with depth measurements\" - This states that a surveying string is used in conjunction with the laser rangefinder to measure depths.\n\nTherefore, there are no additional constraints implied in the text without further context."
