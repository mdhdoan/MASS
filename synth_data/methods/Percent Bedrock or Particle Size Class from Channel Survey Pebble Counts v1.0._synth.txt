2. Abstract:
This method describes a technique for determining the percentage of bedrock or other particulate size classes in a channel based on systematic channel pebble counts. By calculating percentages of observations within stated size classes, researchers can obtain unbiased representations of the substrate characteristics measured. This method is useful for obtaining whole-reach substrate characterizations and interpreting average and percentile data as accurate reflections of the substrate.
3. Description:
The text outlines a method for determining the percentage of bedrock or other particle size classes in a channel based on systematic channel pebble counts. Channel pebble counts are systematically spaced, allowing for averages and percentiles to be interpreted as unbiased representations of the substrate characteristics measured. The method involves reducing systematic channel pebble counts directly to whole-reach substrate characterizations by calculating percentages of observations within stated size classes.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide a reliable and accurate technique for determining the percentage of bedrock or other particle size classes in a channel based on systematic channel pebble counts.
5. Constraints:
The constraints of this method include the need for systematic spacing of channel pebble counts, as well as the requirement for accurate observations within stated size classes. Additionally, the interpretation of averages and percentiles as unbiased representations of substrate characteristics is dependent on the accuracy and completeness of the data collected.
