2. Abstract: Following a habitat restoration project supported by the SRFB, this protocol outlines the necessity of monitoring a newly installed diversion screen in a stream. The objective is to ensure that the screen remains intact and functional according to its engineered specifications, safeguarding fish from both diversion and impingement. Adverse events like flooding may alter the design or efficiency of the screen, requiring close surveillance to maintain the ecological balance of the restored habitat.
3. Description: This method is designed for post-habitat restoration project monitoring, specifically after the installation of a diversion screen in a stream by the SRFB. The purpose of this protocol is to meticulously inspect and record whether the diversion screen continues to adhere to its engineered specifications (Level 1 monitoring). Level 1 monitoring entails evaluating the physical placement and structural integrity of the screen, along with assessing any modifications caused by flooding or other external factors. These alterations may impact the screen's ability to protect fish from diversion or impingement. The procedure aims to preserve the ecological balance achieved through the habitat restoration project by maintaining the effectiveness of the installed diversion screen.
4. Target: Post-habitat restoration project monitoring, ensuring diversion screen integrity, and fish protection.
5. Constraints: This method's success hinges on consistent and timely inspections to assess any changes in the diversion screen's design or efficiency due to flooding or other external factors. Additionally, proper documentation of observations is crucial for maintaining an accurate understanding of the screen's condition over time.
