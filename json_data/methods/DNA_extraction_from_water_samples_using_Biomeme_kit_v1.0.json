  "abstractText": "This extraction procedure purifies environmental DNA collected by water filtration onto a mixed ester filter. This extraction procedure uses a filtration-based method in which DNA selectively binds to the silica membrane inside Biomeme'ssample prep column. Subsequent washes through a sequence of buffers produces purified nucleic acid upon elution.",
