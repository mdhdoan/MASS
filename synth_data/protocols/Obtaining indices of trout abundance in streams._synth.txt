 1. Abstract: The text describes a monitoring protocol aimed at tracking trout abundance trends in stream reaches of watersheds supporting important salmonid populations. The goal is to evaluate changes in local trout populations and habitat conditions, aid in prioritizing improvement efforts, and assess the impact of habitat modifications like barrier removal.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: 
Values: Importance of preserving and improving trout populations for the Coeur d'Alene Tribe.
Problem Statement: Need to monitor and address declining or low fish numbers, localized degradation, and habitat condition deficiencies in stream reaches.
Desired outcomes: Improved reach-scale connectivity, resilient metapopulation structures, and successful colonization of newly created suitable habitats.
3. Description: The protocol focuses on monitoring trout populations (westslope cutthroat trout, redband trout, brook trout, or bull trout) in stream reaches using reach-scale indices. Habitat units and attributes are representative of the selected sample sites. Monitoring helps detect trends, identify issues, prioritize improvements, and assess habitat modifications' success.
4. Objectives: 
Objective: To monitor trout abundance trends in stream reaches to inform improvement efforts.
Summary of Solution Coverage: Comprehensively covers monitoring methods, sampling techniques, and data analysis for tracking trout populations and habitat conditions.
Keywords: Trout abundance trends, stream reaches, habitat conditions, monitoring, sampling, data analysis.
5. Target: Monitoring and improving local trout populations in relevant watersheds.
6. Constraints: The effectiveness of the protocol depends on adequate funding, proper implementation, timely data collection, and accurate analysis.
