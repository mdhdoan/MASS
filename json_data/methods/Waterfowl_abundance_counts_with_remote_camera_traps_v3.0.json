  "abstractText": "Moist soil management activities (tillage, planting, mowing, flooding, and burning) provide valuable habitat improvements for waterfowl and other wetland obligate species. At the TD-1 project waterfowl abundance counts have been occurring for three consecutive years to monitor spring migration and waterfowl response to increased habitat management through moist soil management. During the 2020 remote camera survey season 2 cameras were added to the TD-2 project area. The intention of the TD-2 project area was to create 71 acres of hemi marsh habitat to provide brood ponds for local waterfowl production. Currently with tall emergent vegetation and sedimentation wetlands in TD-2 are seeing very low amounts of waterfowl production. Our goal is to have cameras surveying the area to witness the positive response in waterfowl use as more habitat management occurs. In our study design biologists place elevated camera traps across habitats in a project area. Photos are taken every hour from sunrise to sunset and each camera trap has a measurable surface area (1 acre)to create sub-samples of density estimates across the project area.",
