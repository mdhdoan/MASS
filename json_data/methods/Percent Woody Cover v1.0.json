Estimates are made of the percent of woody cover forthegroundstory (woody shrubs), understory (woody shrubs) and canopy cover (big trees + small trees). These estimates are summed togetherand, therefore, values range from 0-300. A site-wide estimate is made by averaging the scores from each of the ten plots.The CHaMP - Riparian Structure Method provides background on the measurements that are analyzed for this calculation.
