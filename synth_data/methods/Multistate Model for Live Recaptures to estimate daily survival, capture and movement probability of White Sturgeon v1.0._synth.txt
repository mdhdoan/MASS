2. Abstract: Multi-state models are a flexible and powerful tool for analyzing complex processes with multiple states and transitions. These models extend the live recapture model developed by Cormack-Jolly-Seber to allow for multiple areas or life stage states. By explicitly modeling the transitions between states, multi-state models can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of a process and help researchers make informed decisions.
3. Description: Multi-state models are an extension of the live recapture model developed by Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) for multiple areas or life stage states. They allow for the modeling of complex processes with multiple states and transitions, making them a valuable tool in a variety of fields. A multi-state model with live and dead encounters can be fitted using software such as MARK. The simplest form of an MSM is the mortality model for survival analysis, which describes the transition from the alive state to the dead state. Multi-state models are versatile and can be used to model a wide range of longitudinal failure time data.
4. Target: The primary focus of multi-state models is to provide a flexible and powerful tool for analyzing complex processes with multiple states and transitions.
5. Constraints: Multi-state models require the assumption that the process being modeled is a continuous time stochastic process, and that individuals can only move among a finite number of states. Additionally, multi-state models require sufficient data to estimate the transition probabilities between states.
