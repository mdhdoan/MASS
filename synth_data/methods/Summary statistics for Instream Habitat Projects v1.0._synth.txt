 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the five keywords that I believe are most relevant to the method described in the text body:

1. Data analysis
2. Summary statistics
3. Instream habitat projects
4. Statistical testing
5. Habitat conditions

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
This passage describes a method for analyzing field data collected from instream habitats. The data are uploaded into an MS Access database, which computes summary statistics at the reach scale to reflect habitat conditions. These summary statistics were selected based on their high signal-to-noise ratios and include variables such as GPS coordinates, sample date, reach length, reach width, number of AIS present, juvenile fish density, log10 volume of large woody debris (LWD), and more. Statistical significance will be tested for changes in certain variables using a paired-t test. This method is important for understanding and managing instream habitats by providing a quantitative assessment of their conditions.

3. Description:
The text body describes a data analysis method used in instream habitat projects. After collecting field data, the data are uploaded into an MS Access database where summary statistics are computed to reflect habitat conditions at the reach scale. These summary statistics were generally developed as part of the EPA's EMAP and selected based on their high signal-to-noise ratios compared to other potential summary variables. The following variables are reported for Instream Habitat Projects: GPS Coordinates, Sample Date, Reach Length, Reach Width, Number of AIS Present, Juvenile Fish Density, Log10Volume of LWD, Difference in Size Between Measured and Estimated LWD, Mean Residual Pool Vertical Profile Area, Mean Residual Pool Area, Average Maximum Pool Depth, and Average Pool Tail Crest Depth. Statistical significance will be tested for: Number of AIS remaining, Mean Residual Pool Vertical Profile Area, Mean Residual Pool Area, Changes in LWD profile, and Juvenile Abundance using a paired-t test.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide a quantitative assessment of instream habitat conditions by computing summary statistics and testing for statistical significance.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is the need for accurate field data collection, as the analysis relies on the quality of the input data. Additionally, the selection of appropriate summary statistics and the interpretation of statistical significance tests require a solid understanding of the underlying assumptions and limitations.
