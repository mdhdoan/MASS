2. Abstract: The necessity for effective anadromous fish management is highlighted in the Snake River basin due to hydroelectric dam construction and operation impacts. A key method used for evaluating listed Chinook Salmon and steelhead recovery is the smolt-to-adult return (SAR) rate, which reflects survival of returning adults from a migrating cohort of smolts. This SAR estimation method differs as it does not rely on PIT-tags to determine smolt and adult abundances but instead uses aggregate abundances estimated at specific sites such as Lower Granite Dam.
3. Description: Anadromous fish management programs in the Snake River basin aim to mitigate hydroelectric dam impacts and recover ESA-listed wild steelhead and salmon stocks. The primary focus of these efforts is to preserve and recover runs for the benefit of all users. Management actions are guided by crucial population metrics, such as smolt-to-adult return (SAR) rates, which offer insights into listed Chinook Salmon and steelhead status and trends in the Columbia River basin. SAR rates represent survival of returning adults from a particular migrating cohort of smolts and account for most variation in their life cycle. Survival can be evaluated at various locations within the Columbia River system, but most often occur at hydrosystem dams to assess factors like dam passage, river conditions, ocean conditions, and harvest. This specific SAR estimation method differs from traditional methods by not using PIT-tags as the basis for smolt or adult abundances. Instead, it determines these values based on aggregate abundances estimated to have passed at specific sites such as Lower Granite Dam.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to accurately estimate smolt-to-adult return (SAR) rates for anadromous fish in the Snake River basin without relying on PIT-tags.
5. Constraints: This SAR estimation method may face constraints due to potential variability or inconsistency in aggregate abundance estimates at specific sites, as well as limitations associated with not utilizing PIT-tag data for a more accurate determination of smolt and adult abundances.
