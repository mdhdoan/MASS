2. Abstract:
   The method discussed in the text is a statistical approach to summarize and analyze numerical data sets. By calculating measures such as the arithmetic mean, variance, and standard deviation, researchers can effectively describe the central tendencies and dispersion of the data. This provides valuable insights into the sample variation around the mean, offering a comprehensive understanding of the data distribution.

3. Description:
   The text introduces the concept of statistical summaries, specifically focusing on the arithmetic mean. Also known as the mathematical expectation or average, the arithmetic mean is calculated as the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values. This central value serves as a key measure of a data set's central tendency.
   Furthermore, the text discusses variance and standard deviation as additional summary statistics that describe sample variation around the mean. Variance represents the average squared difference between each data point and the mean, while standard deviation is the square root of variance, providing a measure in the same units as the original data.

4. Target:
   The primary goal of this method is to offer a systematic and coherent summary of numerical data sets, highlighting central tendencies and dispersion measures. This facilitates further statistical analysis and interpretation of results.

5. Constraints:
   As with any statistical method, the accuracy and reliability of these summary statistics depend on the quality and representativeness of the input data. Outliers, missing values, or non-random sampling may affect the validity of these measures, requiring careful preprocessing and consideration.
