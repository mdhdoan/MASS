  "abstract": " In this study, researchers aim to understand the size distribution and embeddedness of substrate in fast water habitats. To accomplish this, they plan to measure a total of 110 particles from 10 different cross-sections at each study site. This method was updated from a previous version which included measurement of 210 particles per site. The decrease in the number of particles is a response to improvements in data collection techniques and resources.\n\nBy quantifying the size distribution of substrate, researchers can gain insights into how different particle sizes contribute to the overall habitat structure and function. Estimating embeddedness of cobbles will help us understand their role in stabilizing the riverbed and influencing water flow patterns. This information is crucial for assessing the health and resilience of fast water habitats and for developing effective conservation and restoration strategies."

  "description": " This text outlines two objectives for investigating the size distribution and embeddedness of substrate in fast water habitats. The first objective involves quantifying the size distribution by measuring a specific number of particles from multiple cross-sections. More specifically, this objective entails analyzing 11 particles from each of 10 cross-sections, leading to a total of 110 particles being assessed per site.\n\nThe second objective concerns estimating the embeddedness of cobbles within these fast water habitats. For the 2013 version of this study, adjustments were made to decrease the number of particles from an initial 210 to the current count of 110 for each assessment. This change in methodology likely aimed to streamline data collection and analysis while maintaining a significant sample size for accurate results."

  "constraints": " Based on the given text, there are following constraints applicable to the method:\n\n1. The method involves quantifying the size distribution of substrate in fast water habitats by measuring a total of 110 particles per site from 10 cross-sections (Objectives 1).\n2. The number of particles measured has been decreased from 210 to 110 for changes made in 2013 (Changes made for 2013).\n\nThese constraints are stated explicitly in the text under \"Objectives 1\" and \"Changes made for 2013\". No additional explanation is required as the reason for decreasing the number of particles from 210 to 110 is not provided in the text."
