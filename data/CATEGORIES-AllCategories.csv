"Biological","1","Amphibians","The study of amphibians (class Amphibia), such as frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and gymnophiona.  Amphibians are cold-blooded animals that metamorphose from a juvenile, water-breathing form to an adult, air-breathing form.","39"
"Biological","2","Birds","The study of birds (class Aves), such as waterfowl, seabirds, shorebirds or other classifications of bipedal, endothermic (warm-blooded), vertebrate animals that lay eggs.","41"
"Biological","6","Fish","The study of fish, which are aquatic vertebrate animals that are typically ectothermic (previously cold-blooded), covered with scales, and equipped with two sets of paired fins and several unpaired fins.","68"
"Biological","9","Macroinvertebrates","The term macroinvertebrates refers to macroscopic aquatic or semi-aquatic invertebrates (non-cordates) including the most common species in the phyla, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Porifera, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida, Echinodermata. These include crustaceans, spiders, insects (Arthropods) (e.g., larval Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera), mollusks (e.g., aquatic snails, clams, mussels), and worms (e.g., Platyhelminthes), which inhabit a river channel, pond, lake, or wetland, and that are visible to the naked eye (often greater than 0.5 mm in diameter).  Insects (class Insecta) are a major group of arthropods and the most diverse group of animals on Earth. Mollusks are a group of freshwater and saltwater animal invertebrate species that are a member of the Phylum Mollusca with no skeleton and usually one or two hard shells made of calcium carbonate. Mollusks include the oyster, clam, mussel, snail, conch, scallop, squid, and octopus species. If you are working on a species with larval life stages that are planktonic, you may select the Plankton subject.","38"
"Biological","10","Mammals","The study of mammals (class Mammalia), which are a class of vertebrate animals characterized by the presence of sweat glands (including sweat glands modified for milk production), hair, three middle ear bones used in hearing, and a neocortex region in the brain.","39"
"Biological","12","Disease/Pathogens/Parasites","A pathogen is a biological, infectious agent (virus, bacteria, fungus, or parasite) that causes disease or illness to its host. A disease is an abnormal condition of an organism that impairs bodily functions, reduces production (growth, reproduction, and survival) and can cause death.","7"
"Biological","13","Plankton","The collection of small or microscopic organisms, including algae and protozoans, that float or drift in great numbers in fresh or salt water, especially at or near the surface, and serve as food for fish and other larger organisms. Plankton include bacterioplankton, phytoplankton, and zooplankton. If you are working on a species with non-larval life stages that are macroscopic you may select the Macroinvertebrates subject.","31"
"Biological","15","Multi-Species","The study of a collection of multiple species classes or biological subjects in aggregate. Examples for this subject typically include biodiversity or invasive species.","11"
"Biological","16","Reptiles","The study of reptiles, or members of the class Reptilia, which are air-breathing, cold-blooded tetrapod vertebrates that have skin covered in scales as opposed to hair or feathers.","40"
"Biological","17","Vegetation/Plants","The study of living organisms belonging to the kingdom Plantae. They include familiar organisms such as trees, herbs, bushes, grasses, vines, ferns, mosses, and green algae.","29"
"Chemical","4","Contaminants/Toxics/Pollutants","The study of the degree of toxicity or concentration of contaminants in biological substances, sediments or substrates, or aqueous solutions (pharmaceuticals, pesticides, industrial pollutants, heavy metals, or other contaminants).","22"
"Chemical","18","Water Quality","The physical characteristics of water in relationship to a set of standards. In the United States, water quality standards are created by state agencies for different types of water bodies and water body locations per desired uses. The primary uses considered for such characterization are parameters which relate to drinking water, safety of human contact, and for health of ecosystems. Physical assessments evaluate water total suspended solids and turbidity, temperature, or chemicals (pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), phosphates, and nitrates), conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand, and salinity. If you are working with data on other contaminants including coliform, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, industrial pollutants, or heavy metals.  Cross reference with the environmental metrics under the Contaminants/Toxics/Pollutants subject.","14"
"General","11","Other","Classification used to define studies not currently fitting into the subject groups provided.","8"
"General","23","Classification of Ecological or Geological Attribute ","Study of classification of biological or environmental attributes; including biological species, habitat/geomorphic zones, catena, codes, units, or classes, or geologic formations.","6"
"General","24","Equipment ","Classification to define specific equipment ","3"
"Physical","3","Climate/Weather","The study of atmospheric temperature, water vapor (including clouds, rainfall or snow), or wind (the flow of air or other gases that compose an atmosphere, which may study directionality, duration or intensity).","13"
"Physical","7","Hydrology/Water Quantity","The study of overland, underground, or instream flow; oceanographic currents; water movement; or use of water.  ","16"
"Physical","8","Light","Study of the intensity, frequency/wavelength, or polarization of electromagnetic radiation. Cross reference with the Environmental Conditions subject for other similar metrics or indicators.","3"
"Physical","14","Sediment/Substrate/Soils","Study of conditions of unconsolidated sediment, soils, or substrate. Sediment is any particulate matter that can be transported by fluid flow and which eventually is deposited as a layer of solid particles on the bed or bottom of a body of water or other liquid. Soil is the naturally occurring, unconsolidated or loose covering of broken rock particles and decaying organic matter on the surface of the Earth. Cross reference with the Environmental Conditions and Contaminants/Toxics/Pollutants subjects for other similar metrics or indicators.","16"
"Physical","19","Time","The study of time or temporal attributes.","4"
"Physical","20","Disturbance/Restoration","The study of natural or anthropogenic alteration, degradation/improvement of environmental condition.","6"
"Physical","21","Landscape Form & Geomorphology","The study of landforms in the aquatic environment or terrestrial habitat and the processes that shape or control their topography.","38"
"Physical","22","Upland Geomorphology","The study of landforms above the floodplain and the processes that shape or control their topography.","0"
