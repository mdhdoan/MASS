2. Abstract: The Chelex-100 method is an efficient and adaptable technique for extracting DNA from tissue samples used in genetic analyses. This chelating resin prevents DNA degradation during the digestion process by binding to metal ions that can break down DNA at high temperatures, eliminating the need for purification or washing steps. Although this method may result in lower concentrations of DNA compared to other techniques, it significantly reduces cross-contamination risks and expedites the extraction process, making it particularly suitable for high-throughput laboratories focused on genetic research.
3. Description: Chelex-100 is a chelating resin that has been proven effective in extracting DNA from tissue samples for genetic analyses (Singer-Sam, Tanguay & Riggs, 1989). The primary function of Chelex-100 during the digestion process is to prevent DNA degradation by binding to metal ions that might otherwise break down DNA at high temperatures. This unique feature allows the Chelex method to eliminate purification or washing steps compared to other DNA extraction techniques, thereby reducing cross-contamination risks between containers and/or samples (Walsh, Metzger & Higuchi, 2018). However, this advantage comes with a trade-off: Chelex extractions often yield lower concentrations of DNA in solution than methods that employ purification steps (Singh, Kumari & Iyengar, 2018). Nonetheless, many studies find this trade-off acceptable, especially within high-throughput laboratories, due to the method's efficiency and adaptability.
4. Target: The primary focus of Chelex-100 is on efficient and adaptable DNA extraction from tissue samples with reduced cross-contamination risks.
5. Constraints: Although Chelex-100 extractions may produce lower concentrations of DNA in solution compared to other methods, this constraint can be tolerated by many studies, especially within high-throughput laboratories that value the method's efficiency and adaptability.
