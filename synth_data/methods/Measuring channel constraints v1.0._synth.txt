2. Abstract: This protocol outlines a method for determining and classifying channel constraints in streams and rivers. It is essential to understand the level of channel constraint to effectively manage water resources and plan restoration projects. The method provides a systematic approach for identifying and measuring constraining features such as bedrock, hillslopes, terraces/alluvial fans, and human uses (roads, dikes, landfills, riprap, etc.). By following this protocol, users can make informed decisions on channel constraint classes, bankfull widths, floodplain widths, and constraining feature heights to guide restoration efforts.

3. Description: The given text details a method for determining channel constraints in stream and river systems. It begins by classifying the stream reach channel pattern into one of three categories: predominantly single, anastomosing, or braided channels (Step 1). Following this, it instructs users to assess the level of constraint based on the valley's characteristics and the freedom for the channel to move within that valley (Step 2). The protocol then advises identifying bank and valley features that constrain the stream, including bedrock, hillslopes, terraces/alluvial fans, and human uses like roads, dikes, landfills, riprap, etc. (Step 3).

Based on these observations, users are to select a constraint class from the Channel Constraint Form (Step 4) and estimate the percentage of channel margin in contact with constraining features (Step 5). The method then requires measuring bankfull width at each transect and intermediate transect, visually estimating average floodplain width or using GIS and/or aerial photos if necessary (Step 6). Following this, users must measure the height of constraining features treated by the restoration project (Step 7) and take measurements at specific transects (A, F, & K) to determine bankfull flow heights (Step 8).

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to assess channel constraints in stream and river systems for effective water resource management and planning restoration projects.

5. Constraints: Limitations of this method include the need for direct observation or access to aerial photos/GIS data, potential difficulties in visually estimating floodplain widths, and the requirement of specific equipment (e.g., measuring tools) for accurate height measurements. Time constraints may also pose challenges when conducting extensive on-site assessments.
