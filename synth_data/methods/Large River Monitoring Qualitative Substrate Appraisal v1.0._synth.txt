2. Abstract: This text describes the importance of standardizing sampling methods and techniques for comparing data across field stations. Environmental measurements are taken at every site immediately before sampling for fishes, with a focus on identifying and evaluating substrate as an indicator of local food web conditions and changes over time. The physical structure of rivers can change naturally or due to human activity such as flood mitigation efforts, leading to homogenization of substrates and changes in the biotic community inhabiting the river, often resulting in a reduction of biological diversity.
3. Description: Standardizing sampling effort, techniques, and gear is crucial for comparing data from different field stations. Environmental measurements are recorded at every site immediately before sampling for fishes, allowing for a better understanding of local conditions. Substrate identification is emphasized as it can provide useful information about the local food web and potential changes over time. The structure and composition of benthic macroinvertebrate communities are closely tied to physical traits of the substrate, making substrate appraisal essential during long-term monitoring. Changes in river structuration, whether natural or human-induced, can have significant impacts on the biotic community and biological diversity within the river.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to demonstrate the importance of standardizing sampling methods for data comparison across field stations, with a specific emphasis on substrate appraisal as an indicator of local food web conditions and changes over time.
5. Constraints: One constraint of this method is the need for consistent and accurate identification of substrate, which can be challenging with qualitative assessments. Additionally, long-term monitoring and evaluation of changes in river structuration require significant resources and time commitments.
