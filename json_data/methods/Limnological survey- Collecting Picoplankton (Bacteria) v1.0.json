  "abstractText": "Picoplanktonare planktonic (free-drifting) organisms in the 0.2 to 2.0m size range. As a group, they are ubiquitous to all marine and freshwater systems. They include autotrophs, such as cyanobacteria, as well as heterotrophicbacteria. They can account for a significant portion of the primary production in many lakes and reservoirs. Picoplanktonare often the first taxa to respond to changes in nutrient loading of aquatic systems. Assessing picoplankton is an essential component of any study which involves primary production in aquatic systems with a strong microbial component. (See review by Stocker andAntia1986)This method describes standard procedures used for the field collection and preservation of picoplankton for enumeration by an outside contracting lab using the methods from MacIsaac and Stockner 1993.",
