  "abstractText": "Redd counts are an important tool used to monitor salmonid populations. A key assumption of redd counts is that they are representative of the actual number of redds. However, numerous factors can potentially affect the detectability of redds and leads to errors in redd counts. Error associated with redd counts can result from the timing of counts (i.e., surveys not representative of spawn timing), redd characteristics (e.g., redd size, redd age, and/or substrate composition), spawning habitat characteristics (e.g., stream size, water depth and clarity, and distance to cover), spawner densities (e.g., large number of redds and/or superimposition), and/or surveyor experience. Erroneous counts may obscure important trends and potentially compromise the management and conservation of a species, therefore utilizing redd counts for monitoring abundance of salmonid species needs to be critically examined. The purpose of this method is to describe the procedures utilized to conduct naive observer redd surveys (i.e., observerswith no in-seasona prioriknowledge of redd counts or redd locations) to examine redd detection efficiency.",
