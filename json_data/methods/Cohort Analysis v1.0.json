  "abstractText": "A cohort analysis is a tool that can be used to estimate age-specific abundances when a complete census of harvest of a given species is available. This method eliminates the need for solving of a nonlinear equation for the instantaneous rate of fishing mortality of fish in a population (such as is required for a virtual population analysis), thus simplifying analyses (Pope 1972).",
