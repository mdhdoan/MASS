2. Abstract: This study focuses on evaluating the species composition, temporal abundance patterns, and fish size in different habitats. By utilizing catch per unit effort (CPUE) as a metric for temporal abundance patterns, this method provides valuable insights into how species change over time in various habitats. Understanding these aspects is crucial for effective habitat restoration planning and assessing the success of such projects.
3. Description: The study evaluates species composition at the lowest practical taxonomic level to provide detailed information about the biodiversity present in pre-restoration, post-restoration habitats, and reference sites. Temporal abundance patterns are analyzed using CPUE, which helps quantify changes in fish populations over time. Additionally, fish size is measured through either fork length or total length, providing further insights into the growth and development of these species in different habitats.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to assess and compare the species composition, temporal abundance patterns, and fish size in pre-restoration habitat, post restoration habitat, and reference sites.
5. Constraints: This method's constraints include the availability and accuracy of data on species identification, CPUE, and fish size measurements. Furthermore, environmental factors like water quality, temperature, and seasonality may also impact the study results, necessitating proper consideration and control during data collection.
