 1. Keywords: smaller mesh, fry trawl survey, hatchery components, wild components, size data.
2. Abstract: This method involves the use of a specialized trawl net with smaller mesh sizes to effectively capture fry for surveys. This approach allows for more accurate calculations of hatchery and wild components, as well as size data. The methods used in this survey are based on those described by Rieman (1992) and are similar to midwater trawl surveys.
3. Description: A trawl net with smaller mesh sizes is used in this method to capture fry for surveys. This allows for the inclusion of a greater number of small fish, providing more accurate data on hatchery and wild components. The use of size data from these surveys can also improve the understanding of fish populations and their distribution. The methods employed in this trawl survey are based on those described by Rieman (1992) and follow a similar structure to midwater trawl surveys.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to effectively capture fry for surveys, allowing for more accurate calculations of hatchery and wild components, as well as size data.
5. Constraints: The effectiveness of this method may be limited by the availability of suitable trawl nets with small mesh sizes, as well as the impact of environmental factors on fish behavior and distribution. Additionally, the accuracy of the survey results may depend on proper sampling techniques and adherence to established methods.
