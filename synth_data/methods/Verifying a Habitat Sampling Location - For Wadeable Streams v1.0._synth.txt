2. Abstract: This method outlines the process of verifying a candidate wadeable sample site for suitability. The importance of this method lies in ensuring that the selected site is appropriate for sampling, and that the data collected from it will be accurate and representative. By establishing the boundaries and stations within the site, researchers can create a unique Data Collection Event (DCE) to identify the sampling event and ensure repeatable results.
3. Description: To verify the suitability of a candidate wadeable sample site for sampling, this method provides detailed instructions on how to establish the boundaries and stations within the site. Once the site has been deemed suitable for sampling, a Data Collection Event (DCE) can be created to uniquely identify the sampling event. This method is essential for ensuring accurate and representative data collection from wadeable sample sites.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is on-site verification of candidate wadeable sample sites for suitability in the data collection process.
5. Constraints: This method requires physical access to the wadeable sample site, appropriate equipment and personnel to conduct the verification, and a thorough understanding of the sampling and data collection processes involved.
