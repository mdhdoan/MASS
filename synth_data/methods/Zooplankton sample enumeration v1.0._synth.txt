2. Abstract:
Zooplankton play a significant role in the pelagic food webs, especially as they relate to fish populations. In the upper San Francisco Estuary, specific zooplankton species support endangered and economically important fish such as Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Striped Bass, and juvenile Chinook Salmon. Understanding trophic interactions and food resource availability for these fish requires thorough knowledge of the distribution of zooplankton species. This method describes the approach used by the Department of Water Resources Environmental Monitoring Program and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to count zooplankton, providing essential information for better management and conservation efforts.

3. Description:
This text focuses on the importance of zooplankton in pelagic food webs and their specific role in supporting various fish species found in the upper San Francisco Estuary, including endangered and commercially valuable ones like Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Striped Bass, and juvenile Chinook Salmon. The methodology discussed here is employed by both the Department of Water Resources Environmental Monitoring Program and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to count zooplankton. This process involves meticulously analyzing trophic interactions and food resource availability for fish, which ultimately contributes to improved management and conservation strategies for these species.

4. Target:
The primary goal of this method is to outline the approach used by the Department of Water Resources Environmental Monitoring Program and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to count zooplankton in the upper San Francisco Estuary, offering valuable insights into food resources available for fish populations, particularly endangered species.

5. Constraints:
The method described here may be subject to limitations such as resource availability (e.g., funding, personnel, equipment), seasonal variations, environmental factors impacting zooplankton distribution and abundance, and the need for ongoing research to refine counting techniques and improve their accuracy.
