  "abstractText": "After field data collection, the data are uploaded into an MS Access database which is used to calculate summary statistics to reflect habitat conditions at the reach scale.  These summary statistics were generally developed as part of the EPA EMAP and were selected for this program based on their high signal to noise ratios as compared to other potential summary variables.   The following variables are reported for Constrained Channel Projects: Sample Date, GPS Coordinates, Reach Length, Reach Width, Bankfull Height (XbfHeight), Bankfull Width (XbfWidth), Flood-prone Width (FPW), Channel Capacity (AvgChCap), Mean Residual Pool Vertical Profile Area, Mean Residual Pool Area , Maximum Pool Depth Average, Pool Tail Crest Depth Average, Changes in Fish Density, Height of Constraining Feature, Channel Constraint Removed, Sinuosity Changes, Pool/riffle ratio, Bankfull Width to Depth Ratio, Area of New Habitat Created, and Volume of New Habitat Created.",
