2. Abstract: The method described is a technique for quantifying the proportion of coniferous canopy and understory vegetation cover in riparian areas. This information is crucial for ecosystem management, as coniferous trees play a unique role in many environments. Visual estimates of dominant vegetation are taken at regular transects within a 10m x 10m plot on both banks of the waterway. The data collected from these measurements provides a comprehensive understanding of the riparian structure and informs decision-making processes related to conservation and resource management.

3. Description: The CHaMP Riparian Structure Method, which is based on EMAP methods developed by Peck et al. (2001), outlines a systematic approach for determining the proportion of coniferous canopy and understory vegetation cover within riparian zones. At five predefined transects along both banks of a waterway, researchers visually estimate the dominant vegetation type in the canopy and understory layers. These estimates are converted into scores: 1.0 for 100% coniferous cover, 0.5 for 50% coniferous cover (mixed), and 0 for all other vegetation types. The final proportion of coniferous cover is calculated as the average score from both banks at each transect. This methodology allows researchers to gather essential information about riparian ecosystems while minimizing subjectivity through standardized data collection procedures.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to assess and quantify the extent of coniferous vegetation cover within riparian zones, providing valuable insights for ecosystem management and conservation strategies.

5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method include subjectivity in visual estimates, limited representation due to the small plot size, and challenges associated with accurately identifying mixed vegetation as 50% coniferous cover. Additionally, the need for standardized training and consistent application of the methodology across different research teams may pose some challenges.
