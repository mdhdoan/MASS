  "abstract": " The Fall Chinook salmon are captured at Lower Granite Dam using a specialized system that sorts and identifies specific fish based on their PIT tags. PIT stands for Passive Integrated Transponder, which is a type of tag used to identify individual fish through radio frequency signals.\n\nThe automated sorting process separates juvenile Chinook with PIT tags into a trap. These fish are then sedated using Aqui-S and scanned for their unique PIT tags. When a tagged fish destined for the radio tagging study is identified, scales are collected from the fish, and a new radio tag is inserted.\n\nThis method ensures accurate identification of Chinook salmon for the radio tagging research study. By using the PIT tag system, researchers can efficiently and precisely target specific fish for further analysis without the need for manual handling or physical markings, reducing stress on the fish and increasing data accuracy. The process helps address issues with manually identifying individual fish while ensuring a minimal impact on their wellbeing.\n\nNo code is required to explain this high-level overview of the method."

  "description": " In the given text, Fall Chinook fish are being processed at Lower Granite Dam using an automated system for identifying and tagging them for a radio tagging study. Here is a more detailed, technical description of the process:\n\n1. Fall Chinook fish that carry Programmed-Id Transponder (PIT) tags as juveniles are selectively trapped by an automated sorting system at Lower Granite Dam using specific return codes.\n2. Once in the trap, the fish are transferred into an anesthetic tank for immobilization and calming down with Aqui-S solution.\n3. Each individual fish is then scanned using a PIT tag reader to identify its unique code.\n4. If a fish displays an action code on the monitor screen indicating that it is part of the radio tagging study, the fish undergoes further processing.\n5. Scales are collected from the fish for various research purposes, and a radio tag is inserted into the fish using specialized equipment.\n6. After tagging, the fish are released back into the water to continue their life cycle with the newly installed radio tag, allowing researchers to track and monitor their movements and behavior in real-time."

  "target": " Identifying and tagging Fall Chinook for radio tracking study.\n\nIf needed, here's a more detailed explanation: This process involves using PIT tags to identify specific Fall Chinook at Lower Granite Dam for radio tagging research. Once identified, scales are collected and a new radio tag is inserted into the fish."
}{
  "constraints": " The text describes a process for identifying and tagging Fall Chinook salmon at Lower Granite Dam using PIT tags and radio tags. Based on the information provided, the following constraints can be identified:\n\n1. Specific returns of PIT tagged fish are shunted into the trap by an automated sorting system (implicitly based on their PIT tag codes). This is stated in the first sentence.\n2. Fish are calmed down using Aqui-S before being scanned for PIT tags (implied by the mention of calming them down with Aqui-S before scanning).\n3. Scales and a radio tag are collected and inserted when a PIT tagged fish is identified as part of the radio tagging study (explicitly stated in the text).\n\nThere are no constraints mentioned in the text regarding the type or version of the software used for the automated sorting system, the anesthetic tank or the scanning equipment. These details are not provided in the text and therefore it is not possible to make any assumptions about any specific constraints related to these components."
