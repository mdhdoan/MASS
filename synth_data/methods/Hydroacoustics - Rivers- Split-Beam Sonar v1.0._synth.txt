2. Abstract: Hydroacoustic methods are a valuable tool for assessing the abundance of migrating fish populations in riverine environments, especially when other techniques are impractical due to factors such as wide rivers or turbid waters. These methods utilize sonars to detect and enumerate fish, offering several advantages over more intrusive devices like nets or traps. This approach necessitates careful consideration of various conditions, including fish migration patterns, sonar detection ranges, river bottom profiles, and species composition. Consulting experienced acousticians is recommended to ensure successful implementation.
3. Description: The text discusses the use of hydroacoustic methods, specifically sonars, for assessing fish populations in rivers. These techniques are non-intrusive and often preferable to more intrusive devices such as nets or traps. Hydroacoustic systems can be deployed from fixed, nearshore positions or via mobile down-looking methods. Different sonar types have been used for this purpose, each with its specific requirements and conditions that need to be met for successful fish enumeration. Key considerations include:

a. Fish migration patterns: For accurate counts, fish must be actively migrating and within the detection range of the sonar system. Multiple counts may occur if fish cross the beam repeatedly.
b. River bottom profile: The river bottom should ideally have a linear profile and laminar current flow for optimal sonar performance. Different sonar types, such as the DIDSON, have unique capabilities to address varying slope conditions.
c. Species identification: When multiple species are present, alternative techniques like gillnetting or beach seining must be used to apportion the sonar numbers to individual species.
d. Site-specific testing: Sonar detection ranges should be tested at each site for accurate fish enumeration.

The text highlights the advantages of hydroacoustic methods, such as no handling or mortality associated with acoustic sampling and the three-dimensional positioning capabilities provided by split-beam techniques. However, challenges remain when mixed species are present, requiring additional capture methods to accurately apportion hydroacoustic estimates.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is on utilizing hydroacoustic systems for non-intrusive assessment and enumeration of migrating fish populations in riverine environments.
5. Constraints: Constraints for the current method include:

a. Fish migration behavior: Accurate counts require actively migrating fish within the sonar's detection range.
b. River bottom profile limitations: Optimal sonar performance depends on a linear river bottom profile and laminar current flow.
c. Species composition: When multiple species are present, additional capture methods are required to apportion hydroacoustic estimates accurately.
