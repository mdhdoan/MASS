  "abstractText": "The plan includes three specific indicators of substrate: dominant substrate, depth fines, and embeddedness.  Substrate composition and embeddedness will be assessed within the bankfull width along the channel bottom in the site or reach, regardless if the channel is wet or dry.  Peck et al. (2001) provides methods for measuring embeddedness.  Depth fines will be measured with McNeil core samplers. Large woody debris (LWD) consists of large pieces of relatively stable woody material located within the bankfull channel or spanning the channel.  Investigators will simply count the number of LWD pieces within sites or reaches (wet or dry) in forested streams.  Each piece of LWD will be categorized according to its diameter and length.The plan includes two indicators associated with pool habitat: number of pools per km and residual pool depth.  Fish cover is measured within the wetted width of a site or reach.  Cover types consist of filamentous algae, aquatic macrophytes, moss, LWD, brush and small woody debris, in-channel live tress or roots, overhanging vegetation, undercut banks, boulders, and artificial structures.Off-channel habitat consists of side-channels, off-channel pools, off-channel ponds, and oxbows.",
