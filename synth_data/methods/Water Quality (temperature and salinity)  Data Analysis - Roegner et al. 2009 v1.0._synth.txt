 1. Keywords: water quality parameters, autonomous data logging, temperature, salinity, tidal reconnection.
2. Abstract: This text describes the importance of monitoring water quality parameters to understand the impact of changes in aquatic habitats. It highlights the use of autonomous data logging equipment to measure these parameters and recommends focusing on temperature and salinity as critical metrics for tidal freshwater and estuarine habitats due to their influence on organism tolerance and habitat opportunity.
3. Description: The text emphasizes that different organisms have varying tolerances to water quality parameters, including temperature, salinity, turbidity, pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO). Monitoring variations in these parameters pre- and post-restoration helps assess changes in habitat opportunity, which is crucial for explaining shifts in flora and fauna accompanying hydrologic reconnection. Increased tidal circulation can reduce excessive temperature and maintain suitable DO levels, while higher salinity intrusion can shape vegetation community structure in restored sites. Autonomous data logging equipment, such as water level loggers measuring temperature or salinity, is recommended for regular monitoring. The text highlights specific challenges with DO measurements and suggests prioritizing temperature monitoring in tidal freshwater environments and both temperature and salinity in estuarine habitats as the minimum core metrics.
4. Target: Improving aquatic habitat management by focusing on critical water quality parameters like temperature and salinity through continuous, autonomous data logging.
5. Constraints: The main constraint is the complexity of measuring certain parameters, particularly DO levels, due to potential data collection issues. This challenge may result in a focus on temperature and salinity as core metrics for monitoring aquatic habitats.
