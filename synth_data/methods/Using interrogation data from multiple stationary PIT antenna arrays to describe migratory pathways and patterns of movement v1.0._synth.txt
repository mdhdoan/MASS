2. Abstract:
Fish migration patterns are crucial for understanding their life cycles and managing fish populations within a watershed. By using stationary interrogation PIT arrays, researchers can gather data on individual fish as they pass through these arrays, building histories of movement patterns or migratory pathways. This information can reveal important details such as where adult fish spawn and which tributaries support juveniles with migratory behavior. Additionally, multiple interrogation stations can help identify temporary seasonal rearing habitats for migratory salmonids. The data from these arrays can be compiled into a central database, allowing researchers to query the information and gain valuable insights into fish migration.

3. Description:
The text describes a method of tracking fish movement using stationary interrogation PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) arrays within a watershed. These arrays collect data on individual fish as they pass through, building histories for each fish that reveal their movement patterns or migratory pathways. The data from multiple arrays can be combined in a master database to facilitate queries and generate detailed migratory histories. By analyzing this information, researchers can learn where migratory adult fish spawn within a watershed, which tributaries support juveniles with migratory behavior, and the locations of temporary seasonal rearing habitats for salmonids.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to monitor and analyze fish migration patterns in order to understand their life cycles, spawning habits, and rearing habitats. This information can help with managing fish populations within a watershed.

5. Constraints:
A constraint for this method may be the cost and maintenance associated with installing and maintaining stationary interrogation PIT arrays throughout a watershed. Another potential limitation could be the need to ensure that fish passing through the arrays are properly tagged with PIT transponders, as untagged fish would not be detected by the arrays. Additionally, environmental factors such as water flow or sediment deposition might affect the accuracy of PIT array readings.
