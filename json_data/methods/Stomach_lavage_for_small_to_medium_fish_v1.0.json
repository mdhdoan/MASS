  "abstractText": "The stomachlavagesampling technique is used to sample live, anesthetized fish with multiple pulses of water to displace the stomach contents by regurgitation. Fish anesthetizingshould follow Method #5356. Forceps may also be used to dislodge any visible morsels left in the mouth. The stomach contents will be analyzed to describe fish diet (Northingtonand Hershey 2006) and correlatefish foraging habits to the available invertebrate community.This technique has been reported to remove up to 98.9% of gut contents with little effect on subsequent survival and condition (Strange and Kennedy 1981; Waters, Kwak et al. 2004).This method has been successfullyand safely (no mortality associated with lavage sampling) used onsalmonidswith a fork length greater than80mmandsculpinlarger than65mmtotal length.",
