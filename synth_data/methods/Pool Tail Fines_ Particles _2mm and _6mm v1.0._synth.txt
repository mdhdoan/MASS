2. Abstract: This method describes the process of measuring the average percentage of fine sediment in a pool tail substrate. The necessity for this method arises from the need to quantify the amount of fine sediment present in aquatic environments, as it can have detrimental effects on the ecosystem. By estimating the percent composition of fines and sand, researchers can gain insights into the health and stability of these habitats. This information is collected using a standardized data collection method, which ensures accuracy and consistency across different sites.

3. Description: The method focuses on determining the average percentage of pool tail substrates comprised of fine sediment with particle sizes less than 2mm and 6mm. To do this, researchers visually estimate the percent composition of fines (<6mm) and sand (<2mm) as a percentage of the total substrate for each habitat unit within the site. The data collection method is outlined in detail at <https://www.monitoringmethods.org/Method/Details/5329>, providing clear instructions on how to implement this method in practice.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to quantify the amount of fine sediment present in pool tail substrates, with the goal of assessing the health and stability of aquatic habitats.

5. Constraints: One constraint for this method may be the subjective nature of visual estimation, which can lead to inconsistencies between researchers. Additionally, the method's reliance on a specific data collection method means that comparisons with other studies using different methods may not be directly applicable. Finally, the applicability of this method may be limited to environments where pool tail substrates are present and accessible for sampling.
