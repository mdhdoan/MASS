  "abstractText": "Steelhead offer a unique life history type that allows adult population estimation through capture and recapture at the same site during their spawning migration. Because steelhead do not always die after spawning like other pacific salmon, we can capture and recapture fish on their upstream and downstream spawning migrations respectively. Kelt traps are used to capture post-spawn steelhead.These traps are classified as Dip Net traps in PTAGIS.",
