 1. Keywords: Adult sex ratio, anadromous salmonid populations, sex determination, sampling methods, redds estimation.

2. Abstract: The importance of understanding adult sex ratios in anadromous salmonid populations is highlighted in this method. Accurate counts of males and females are necessary for estimating the number of redds constructed, egg deposition, and prospective juvenile production. Various sampling methods such as weir sampling, adult trap sampling, and carcass surveys are detailed to determine the sex of the individuals. The necessity of this method lies in its contribution to effective population management and conservation efforts.

3. Description: This method focuses on determining the adult sex ratio of anadromous salmonid populations by counting males and females during various sampling methods like weir sampling, adult trap sampling, carcass surveys, or any other sampling where the sex of the individuals can be readily determined. Details of sex determination methods for anadromous adults are provided in method #1429. The adult sex ratio is crucial as it helps estimate the number of redds constructed and subsequent egg deposition and juvenile production. Understanding these aspects contributes significantly to effective population management, conservation efforts, and informed decision-making for these species.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is estimating adult sex ratios in anadromous salmonid populations and their implications for population management and conservation.

5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method may include challenges in accurately determining the sex of individuals, variability in sampling methods, limitations in accessing suitable sampling locations, and potential biases introduced by environmental factors or human intervention.
