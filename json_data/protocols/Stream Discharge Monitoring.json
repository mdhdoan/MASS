  "background": "Stream flow (discharge) monitoring provides critical information for restoration efforts. Knowing how much water is in a stream is extremely important for fish restoration. Many communities rely upon stream water for irrigating their crops and livestock. By having a robust stream flow monitoring program information is collected to inform water management, restoration and other decisions.",
