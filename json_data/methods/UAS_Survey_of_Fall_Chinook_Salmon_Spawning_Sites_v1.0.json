  "abstractText": "Beginning in 2015, a switch was made from counting fall Chinook salmon redds in Hells Canyon on the Snake River with manned helicopter surveys to counts made with an unmanned aerial system (UAS, aka drone). After a preseason selection of sites to be surveyed is made, UAS is used to collect video imagery of each spawning site for later analysis and determination of a total annual redd count.",
