  "abstractText": "To study the complex coastal migrations patterns exhibited by juvenile Columbia River Chinook salmon as they enter and move through the marine environment, we created an individual-based model in a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian framework. We modeled five distinct migration strategies and compared the resulting spatial distributions to catch data collected during May and June in three years.",
