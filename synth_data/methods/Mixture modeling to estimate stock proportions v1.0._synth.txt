2. Abstract: Mixture modeling is a method used to estimate the proportion of individual samples belonging to each stock in a mixture. This approach has been shown to be more accurate than other methods when individual assignments cannot be made with high confidence. The use of multi-locus genotype data and software programs such as gsi\_sim can further enhance the accuracy of these estimates.

3. Description: Mixture modeling is a method that uses likelihood or Bayesian modeling techniques to allocate individual samples within a mixture to each stock in proportion to the probability that it belongs to that stock. According to studies by Manel et al. (2005) and Koljonen et al. (2005), this method has been shown to be more accurate for estimating stock composition when all individual assignments cannot be made with high confidence. The text describes the use of mixture modeling in the context of fisheries, where it can be used to estimate the proportions of stocks sampled using multi-locus genotype data. A brief procedure for using the gsi\_sim software program is also provided.

4. Target: The primary focus or goal of mixture modeling is to improve the accuracy of stock composition estimates in cases where individual assignments cannot be made with high confidence.

5. Constraints: One constraint of this method is the need for multi-locus genotype data and appropriate software programs, such as gsi\_sim, in order to perform the analysis. Additionally, the accuracy of the estimates may depend on the quality of the data and the underlying assumptions of the modeling techniques used.
