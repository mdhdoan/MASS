  "abstractText": "Beach seines, fyke nets, trawling, purse seining,and minnow traps will be used to sample juvenile fish for length, weight, scale samples, and other biological information and for the marking of fish with PIT tags for survival estimates.  Fish are anaesthetized in a MS-222 bath (3 ml MS-222 stock solution (100 g/L) per 19 L of water) buffered with propolyaqua (PRO-NOVAQUA).  Age groups will be determined through use of the scale method.  Tissue samples from a fin clip will be used for genetic analysis.   Beach seining will be accomplished with the use of a jet boat where appropriate and/or by wading in predetermined sampling sites.  Beach seines are 100' x 6' x 3/16 mesh and 50' x 4' x 3/16 mesh; 20' x 6' (with a 4' inner bag) x 3/16 mesh, 15' x 6' (with a 4' inner bag) x 3/16 mesh, or 10' x 6' (with a 4' inner bag) x 3/16 mesh.  Fyke nets will have 4' square openings x 50' wings x 3/16 mesh and minnow traps are 16 long x 8 in diameter x 3/32 mesh.  Trawling (10X10X30) and purse seining (500X 30) will be using prop boats.   Age 0+ Chinook salmon will be captured by beach seines and fyke nets along shoreline areas and in slack water areas with trawls and purse seines.   All age 0+ fall Chinook salmon 60 mm and greater will be placed in 5 gallon holding buckets and transferred to a pan of anesthetic water (MS 222 at 60-70 ppm).  All fish will be measured, weighed, and scanned for PIT tags.",
