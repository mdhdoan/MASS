  "abstractText": "Brood routes are a great way to track changes of local waterfowl production throughout the years. By monitoring the amount of broods present on wetlands, managers can determine factors leading to high brood counts or find factors that are limiting production. Factors could include invertebrate availability, tall emergent vegetation, wetland succession, and available nesting habitat. Furthermore, it allows us to watch and see what land management decisions actually affect local waterfowl production.",
