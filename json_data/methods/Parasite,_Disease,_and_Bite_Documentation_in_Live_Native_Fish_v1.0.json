  "abstractText": "Parasites and diseases can provide valuable information regarding the health of the native fish community. Documenting visible parasites or diseases can be a useful way to determine where a specimen is coming from and in what water conditions and quality it has previously been subjected to (Persons et al. 2013). Identifyingparasites and diseases can also influence the type of monitoring the captured fish receives, as some parasites and diseases may alter the effectiveness of a particular tracking device (Persons et al. 2013).In addition, it is also important to document any bite marks on captured live native fish. Similarly to parasites and diseases, bite marks can help determine where a specimen is coming from. It may also provide information of the predators in the region as well.",
