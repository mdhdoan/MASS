  "abstractText": "Vertical stage measurements are obtained from mounted staff gauges. Most staff gauges are graduated in 0.01 feet increments. Staff gauges should be referenced to a known elevation so that stage measurements can be converted to an elevation (this allows for replacement of any damaged or destroyed staff gauges). See photo of a typical staff gauge.",
