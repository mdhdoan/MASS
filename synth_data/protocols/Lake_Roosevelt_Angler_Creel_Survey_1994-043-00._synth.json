  "abstract": " The Lake Roosevelt angler creel survey is a cooperative data collection effort by the Spokane Tribe of Indians, Colville Confederated Tribes, and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife to monitor the effectiveness of the Lake Roosevelt Artificial Production Program (LRAPP) and assess the contribution of hatchery fish to the fishery.\n\nThe survey collects information from anglers about the numbers and species of fish caught, harvested, and released, reported angling effort, and fish morphometric data. These data are used to estimate annual angler pressure, catch, harvest, and catch-rate, as well as the economic value of the fishery.\n\nThe necessity of this survey arises from the fact that Grand Coulee Dam blocked the migratory pathways of numerous fish species in 1949, leading to the extirpation of salmon and lamprey and fragmenting resident fish populations. To mitigate the loss of anadromous fish runs, LRAPP was established, which releases hatchery fish into Lake Roosevelt. Identifying hatchery fish is critical for assessing the performance of release strategies and protecting wild stocks of kokanee and rainbow trout through fishing regulations.\n\nThe survey also addresses concerns about distribution of fishing efforts within a day, between days during the week, and from one time block to another. It ensures that all data are collected between sunrise and sundown and that the number of boats launched outside access points is negligible. By focusing primarily on boat anglers instead of shore anglers, the survey captures most of the fishing pressure in Lake Roosevelt.\n\nThe ability to easily identify hatchery fish through fin clip or otolith marks enables accurate assessments of fishery performance and economic contributions while ensuring sustainable wild fish populations."

  "problem_statement": " The Lake Roosevelt angler creel survey aims to collect data on various aspects of fishing activities within Lake Roosevelt to estimate annual angler pressure, catch, harvest, and catch-rate, as well as the economic value of the fishery. Specifically, the survey monitors the effectiveness of hatchery release strategies by identifying hatchery fish through fin clips and otolith marks, assessing growth and condition at harvest using morphometric data, and estimating total catch, harvest, angler effort, and angler catch-per-unit-effort to evaluate the contribution of hatchery fishes to the fishery. The survey is implemented cooperatively by various entities, including the Spokane Tribe of Indians, Colville Confederated Tribes, and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife."

  "description": " The Lake Roosevelt angler creel survey is a cooperative data collection initiative implemented by the Spokane Tribe of Indians, Colville Confederated Tribes, and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW). The primary objective of this survey is to monitor the effectiveness of the Lake Roosevelt Artificial Production Program (LRAPP) and assess the contribution of hatchery fish to the fishery. This includes estimating annual angler pressure, catch, harvest, and catch-rates, as well as evaluating the economic value of the fishery.\n\nThe survey collects data on various aspects of angling activities within Lake Roosevelt. These include the numbers of each fish species caught, harvested, and released by anglers, reported angling effort, and fish morphometric data that is used to assess growth and condition at harvest. Angler creels are employed to record these data during encounters with anglers.\n\nThe survey design consists of two main components: a time-space sample design and a stratified random sampling scheme. Anglers are encountered in a systematic, random manner across different days of the week (five weekdays and two weekend days) and at various times throughout the day (divided into multiple time blocks). This design allows for the investigation of potential differences in fishing efforts among and between days, as well as from one time block to another.\n\nAll hatchery fish released into Lake Roosevelt are marked with a fin clip (typically an adipose fin clip) and/or an otolith mark prior to release. The ability to easily identify hatchery fish is essential for assessing the performance of hatchery release strategies and developing fishing regulations that protect wild stocks of kokanee and rainbow trout.\n\nData collected during the survey are used to estimate key fishery metrics such as total catch, harvest, total angler effort, and angler catch-per-unit-effort. These estimates provide valuable insights into the role hatchery fish play in the Lake Roosevelt fishery and contribute to the understanding of its economic importance within the region.\n\nIt is important to note that most fishing trips are completed between sunrise and sundown, and the number of boats launched outside access points is negligible. Additionally, most fishing pressure comes from boat anglers rather than shore anglers. This information can be considered when interpreting the survey results and developing fishery management strategies."
