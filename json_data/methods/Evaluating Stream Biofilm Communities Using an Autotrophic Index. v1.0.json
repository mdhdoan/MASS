  "abstractText": "Stream autotrophic production is dominated by photosynthetic algae, representing an important trophic level in freshwater food webs. We propose to measure biofilm standing stock (chlorophyll a (mg m-2) and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) (g m-2)) and C and N stable isotopes from natural substrata in all study streams. Samples will ultimately be analyzed for chlorophyll a and AFDM using standard laboratory methods (APHA 1995) and for C and N stable isotopes as mentioned above. The trophic nature of stream biofilm communities will be evaluated using the autotrophic index calculated using the following equation: AI = (AFDM (mg m-2) / Chlorophyll a (mg m-2)) (Steinman & Lamberti 1996).",
