  "abstractText": "Entrenchment ratios are commonly used in evaluating degree of floodplain connectivity at time of high flow events and, as such, are routinely utilized for stream channel typing. Less commonly used than entrenchment ratios, incision ratios are a more sensitve measure of near-term bed degradation which enables earlier identification of channel downcutting or degradation trends.",
