 1. Abstract: This document outlines the procedures for collecting and managing habitat variable data in the Columbia Basin Region to support the Columbia River Wildlife Mitigation Program funded by Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The protocol prioritizes consistency, user-friendliness, and accessibility for both novice and experienced field technicians.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: 
   - Values: Importance of consistent data collection for effective wildlife mitigation efforts.
   - Problem Statement: Inconsistent habitat variable data collection methods in the Columbia Basin Region.
   - Desired outcomes: Standardized data collection techniques, enhanced collaboration among field technicians, and improved efficiency in wildlife mitigation programs.
3. Description: The protocol provides detailed guidance on Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) and Combined Habitat Assessment Protocols (CHAP) transect techniques used by the Regional HEP Team. It aims to minimize theoretical discussions and emphasize measurement technique instructions using English measurements for better public understanding, with provisions for easy conversion to metric equivalents if required.
4. Objectives: 
   - Objective: To establish standardized habitat variable data collection methods across the Columbia Basin Region for the Columbia River Wildlife Mitigation Program.
   - Summary of Solution Coverage: The protocol covers all necessary aspects of consistent data collection, from defining key terms to specifying measurement devices and techniques.
   - Keywords: Columbia Basin Region, habitat variable data, HEP, CHAP, transect techniques, standardization, wildlife mitigation, BPA funding.
5. Target: Standardize habitat variable data collection in the Columbia Basin Region for improved wildlife mitigation.
6. Constraints: The primary constraint is ensuring that field technicians have access to and familiarity with the required measuring devices discussed in this manual. Additionally, the protocol assumes a basic level of English proficiency for understanding measurements and instructions.
