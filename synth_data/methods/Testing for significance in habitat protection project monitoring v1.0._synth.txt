2. Abstract: This method describes a statistical sampling approach to evaluate the effectiveness of SRFB habitat protection projects over time. A random sample is drawn without replacement from completed projects and monitored for response indicators. The necessary sample size is determined by considering variation from year to year and among projects, signal to noise ratio, and power of the test. A linear regression model is used to estimate the number of sites required to detect changes in stream locations' condition through time.
3. Description: The text outlines a method for assessing the impact of SRFB habitat protection projects by drawing a random sample without replacement from completed projects. This sampling approach aims to ensure that the sample size is large enough to detect significant changes in response indicators over a relatively short period. The number of projects to be sampled is determined based on factors such as variation among projects and years, signal to noise ratio, and power of the test. Existing data from EMAP sampling conducted by the USEPA and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife are used to estimate minimum sample sizes needed to detect change. A simple linear regression model is employed to estimate the number of sites required to determine whether stream locations improve or decline in condition through time, with each habitat variable regressed against year. The slope significantly different from zero indicates a change in resource condition, with improvement indicated by a positive slope and decline by a negative slope. This method assumes that the response variable is normally distributed.
4. Target: Evaluation of the effectiveness of SRFB habitat protection projects over time.
5. Constraints: The success of this method depends on the availability and quality of existing data, as well as the assumption that the response variable is normally distributed.
