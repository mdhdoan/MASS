 1. Keywords: Adult trapping, salmonid populations, management strategies, run escapement estimates, species composition.

2. Abstract: Adult trapping facilities are crucial for studying salmonid populations as they allow for the collection of valuable data on population size, sex ratios, and species distribution. These facilities also enable the monitoring of fish responses to management and recovery efforts, and aid in the re-capture of tagged individuals for further study. The ability to collect tissue and scale samples provides important information for genetic analysis and stock identification.

3. Description: Adult trapping facilities are used to estimate run escapement, which refers to the number of adult fish that have reached their spawning grounds. This is an essential metric in managing and recovering salmonid populations. These facilities also enable the determination of sex ratios and species composition within a population, providing insights into population dynamics and potential impacts of management strategies. By re-capturing tagged individuals, researchers can gather information on fish movement, survival rates, and growth. Additionally, tissue and scale samples collected from trapped fish can be used for genetic analysis, stock identification, and age estimation.

4. Target: The primary focus of adult trapping facilities is to gather valuable data on salmonid populations, their responses to management strategies, and provide insights into population dynamics.

5. Constraints: Adult trapping facilities require proper design, construction, and maintenance to ensure the safety and well-being of the trapped fish. Additionally, these facilities must comply with relevant regulations and guidelines to minimize environmental impacts. Access to suitable locations for trapping facilities may also be a constraint, as they need to be situated in areas where salmonids are present and able to safely navigate.
