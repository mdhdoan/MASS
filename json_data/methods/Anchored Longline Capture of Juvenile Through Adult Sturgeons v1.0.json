  "abstractText": "Longlines are a passive sampling gearemploying baited hooks that can be used inmarine and freshwaterhabitats in both commercial and research fishing applications (Everhart and Youngs 1981; Hubert 1996). Within freshwater they can be employed in both lentic and lotic habitats (Hubert 1996). Depending on hook size, a widesize range of sturgeons may be captured (Elliot and Beamesderfer 1990).Anchored longlines can be highly effective at capturing large numbers of sturgeon while minimizing bycatch of other species (Elliot and Beamesderfer 1990). Because of their simple design and deployment training and maintenance costs are minimal and efforts can be standardized across multiple geographic strata and sampling platforms.",
