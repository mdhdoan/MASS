  "abstractText": "Riparian vegetation type is visually estimated as the major vegetation (either species or vegetation type, such as grasses) and categorized by percent of the 200-m boat electrofishing transect composed of each species or vegetation type. This estimate is made by one observer on the crew and is confirmed by discussion with the two crew members.It is an ocular estimate only on the bank adjacent to the boat electrofishing transect. Because the river is roughly 100 m wide, we do not think the opposite bank strongly influences the fish we capture.",
