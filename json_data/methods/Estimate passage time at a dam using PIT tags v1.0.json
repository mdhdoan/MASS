  "abstractText": "PIT tag antennas are commonly located at multiple locations in fish ladders. An estimate of minimum passage time can be estimated by subtracting the first detection time at a dam from the last detection time at a dam. At most dams, this only covers a small distance of the total passage distance, however this statistic can be useful in uncovering passage problems (e.g. Murauskaset. al,2014)",
