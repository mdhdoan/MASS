  "abstractText": "Fin tissue sampling is conducted to describe genetic structure of and relationships within salmonid populations. DNA will be extracted from these tissues,amplified, and genotyped. Sampling will occur in various basins to further refine our understanding ofpopulation structure and/or todetermine parentage, pedigree, or relationship (i.e., siblings or half-sibs), which in turn can contribute to assessment of reproductive success. Tissues taken will be nonlethal fin clips to minimize impact on at-risk wild and natural populations. Age of salmonids targeted for sampling will depend on study objective. Field collections will be made by various techniques, including but not limited to seines, screw traps, or electrofishing. Any use of electrofishing will be conducted in accordance with NOAAs Guidelines for Electrofishing Waters Containing Salmonids Listed Under the Endangered Species Act (available from http://www.nwr.noaa.gov).",
