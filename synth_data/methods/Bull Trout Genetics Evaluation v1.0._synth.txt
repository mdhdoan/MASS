2. Abstract: This method describes the use of genetic analysis to assess the impact of incidental bull trout capture during predator removal efforts. By examining bull trout mortalities, researchers can determine their origin and evaluate potential effects on local and regional runs. This approach is crucial for understanding and mitigating the unintended consequences of predator control strategies.
3. Description: Predator removal programs often inadvertently capture non-target species, including bull trout. Although efforts are made to minimize catch and mortality rates, some bull trouts do not survive these incidents. To understand the implications for local and regional populations, researchers employ a genetic analysis method. This technique assigns mortalities back to their original tributaries and regions, enabling evaluation of potential impacts on specific runs. By closely examining the effects of bycatch on bull trout populations, scientists can refine predator control strategies and minimize unintended harm to native species.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to estimate and understand the impact of incidental bull trout capture during predator removal efforts at a regional and tributary scale using genetic analysis.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method include obtaining sufficiently large sample sizes, ensuring accurate genetic data, and developing robust assignment models that can reliably infer an individual's origin from its genetic makeup. Other limitations may arise from the potential presence of multiple populations within a single tributary or genetic similarities between neighboring regions, which could complicate the analysis and interpretation of results.
