 1. Abstract: The text outlines a water quality monitoring protocol for the Wenatchee and Entiat River subbasins in the Upper Columbia Basin. The protocol aims to continuously monitor key water quality attributes, address exceedences of Clean Water Act standards, determine sources and trends of pollutants, and standardize monitoring procedures.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: The value of this protocol lies in its contribution to protecting water quality, ensuring compliance with regulations, and providing data for informed decision-making. The problem statement is the need to monitor and manage water quality in the Wenatchee and Entiat River subbasins. Desired outcomes include identifying sources of pollution, addressing Clean Water Act exceedences, and standardizing monitoring procedures.
3. Description: The text details the continuous monitoring of temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and seasonal measurements of nitrogen and phosphorous in the Wenatchee and Entiat River subbasins. Monitoring locations are chosen near flow gauges for assessing stream flow effects on water quality attributes. The protocol aims to determine the source and trend of elevated turbidity levels, address Clean Water Act exceedences, and standardize monitoring procedures.
4. Objectives: The primary objective is to ensure compliance with Clean Water Act standards by addressing pH exceedences and continuously monitoring temperature at selected sites in the Entiat River subbasin. This objective covers the problem statement of ensuring water quality compliance and its keywords include Clean Water Act, pH, and temperature.
5. Target: The main target of this protocol is to improve water quality management and ensure compliance with regulations in the Wenatchee and Entiat River subbasins.
6. Constraints: Potential constraints for this protocol include limited resources, data accuracy and availability, and changes in environmental conditions affecting water quality.
