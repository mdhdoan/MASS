2. Abstract: Parametric tests are essential for statistical analysis in various fields. These tests include the independent t-test, paired t-test, and mean t-test. The independent t-test and paired t-test are used to compare means between two samples, while the mean t-test or one-sample t-test is used to compare a sample mean with a known population parameter. Although less commonly used in fisheries management, the mean t-test can be valuable when population parameters are known. The two-sample t-test, in particular, determines if there is a significant difference between the means of two populations.
3. Description: Parametric tests are statistical methods that make certain assumptions about the data distribution, such as normality and equal variances. They offer robustness and sensitivity, making them widely used in various applications. The independent t-test compares the means of two independent groups to determine if they come from the same population. In contrast, the paired t-test, also known as the dependent t-test, is used when the samples are dependent or related, such as before and after measurements on the same group. The mean t-test, often referred to as the one-sample t-test, compares a sample's mean to a predetermined value, typically the true population parameter, which is rarely known in practice. Despite its limited use in fisheries management, it can still provide valuable insights when comparing sample means with established parameters. The two-sample t-test assesses whether there is a significant difference between the means of two populations based on the samples drawn from each.
4. Target: The primary focus of these parametric tests is to compare and determine statistical differences in means across one or two samples, providing insights into data distribution, relationships, and significance.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for these methods include the assumption of normality, equal variances, and the requirement of a sufficient sample size to ensure robust results and minimize type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) errors.
