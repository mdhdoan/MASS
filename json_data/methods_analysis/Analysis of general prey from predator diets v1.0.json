  "abstractText": "The purpose of this method is to describe the general analysis of prey consumed by fish predators. It coversbasic steps of sorting, identifying, and weighing different prey items in predator diets. The information produced by this method could be used to derive descriptive summary statistics of predator diets. This method would apply when analyzing the diets of piscine predators such as smallmouth bass, northern pikeminnow, and channel catfish. This method assumes that stomach samples have been collected and stored in sample containers with a preservative or frozen (see method ID: 1445 for collection details). The method described is for smallmouth bass stomach samples, but can be customized for other species.",
