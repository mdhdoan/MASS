 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are five keywords that summarize the main topics and themes covered in the text body:

1. Fine sediment assessment
2. Salmonid spawning substrates
3. Particle size distribution
4. Gravel cleaning benefits
5. Field measurement techniques

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract:
The method of assessing fine sediment in salmonid spawning substrates is crucial for ensuring healthy fish populations and maintaining the ecological balance of aquatic systems. Excessive fine sediment can smother eggs and reduce fry survival, particularly when particle sizes are less than 1mm. This method involves estimating the percentage of fine sediment within pool-tailouts, glides, and small cobble-gravel riffles, and measuring it in the field to the nearest 5%. The benefits of gravel cleaning by spawning salmonids are also considered, highlighting the potential for improved water quality and increased fish habitat.
3. Description:
The text describes a method for assessing fine sediment in salmonid spawning substrates, which involves estimating the percentage of fine sediment within specific streambed features such as pool-tailouts, glides, and small cobble-gravel riffles. The effect of fine sediment on egg to fry survival is primarily associated with particle sizes less than 1mm, as measured by particles less than 0.85 mm. Sand size particles (e.g., less than 6 mm) can also be a concern when excessive accumulations occur in the upper stratum of the stream bed. The text provides guidelines for field measurement techniques and emphasizes the potential benefits of gravel cleaning by spawning salmonids, which can improve water quality and increase fish habitat.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to assess the amount and distribution of fine sediment in salmonid spawning substrates, with a view towards maintaining healthy fish populations and ecological balance in aquatic systems.
5. Constraints:
One constraint for this method is the need for accurate field measurement techniques, as fine sediment must be measured to the nearest 5% in order to provide meaningful data. Additionally, the method may be limited by the availability of resources such as time and personnel, as well as environmental factors such as weather conditions and water levels.
