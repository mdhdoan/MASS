2. Abstract: This method describes the importance and process of analyzing water samples to validate the signature (mean Sr 87/86 ratio) of tributary and mainstem sampling locations in the Kootenai River. The study collects adult and Age-0 fish for otolith analysis, using precise water sample values as a complementary reference. This approach helps ensure accurate interpretation of otolith data by confirming that both sources indicate similar isotopic ratios.
3. Description: The text presents a method used in many otolith microchemistry studies, which involves analyzing water samples to determine the isotopic and trace element compositions of water bodies. For this study (Protocol ID: 556), water samples are collected from the Kootenai River's tributaries and mainstem, where adult and Age-0 fish are also gathered for otolith analysis. The primary objective is to validate the Sr 87/86 signature of these sampling locations by analyzing water samples and comparing their mean Sr 87/86 ratios with the ones obtained from fish otoliths. This method enhances the reliability of otolith-derived data when both sources indicate consistent isotopic ratios, providing a more accurate understanding of the water bodies' conditions.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to validate the Sr 87/86 signature of tributary and mainstem sampling locations in the Kootenai River by analyzing water samples and comparing their results with otolith data.
5. Constraints: The success of this method depends on proper study design, accurate water sample collection, appropriate analysis techniques for both water samples and fish otoliths, and careful interpretation of the resulting isotopic ratios. Any inconsistencies or errors in these steps may compromise the validity of the conclusions drawn from the data.
