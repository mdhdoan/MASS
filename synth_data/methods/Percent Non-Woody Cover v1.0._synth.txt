2. Abstract:
The text discusses a method for estimating non-woody coverage in riparian areas, using the CHaMP Riparian Structure Method based on Peck et al. (2001) EMAP methods. Estimates are taken at predefined transects and evaluated for groundstory, understory, and canopy cover. These values range from 0-300 and are averaged across ten plots to obtain a site-wide estimate. This method provides a standardized approach for assessing non-woody coverage in riparian ecosystems.

3. Description:
The text presents the CHaMP Riparian Structure Method, which involves estimating non-woody cover at five predefined transect locations along both banks of a 10m x 10m plot, beginning at bankfull. The percent of non-woody cover is evaluated for groundstory, understory, and canopy layers. These estimates are then summed, resulting in possible values between 0 and 300. A site-wide estimate is obtained by averaging the scores from each of the ten plots. The method is based on Peck et al. (2001) EMAP methods.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to provide a standardized approach for estimating non-woody coverage in riparian areas, facilitating comparative analyses across different sites and studies.

5. Constraints:
No explicit constraints are mentioned in the text; however, factors such as accessibility to the study area, consistent measurement techniques, and reliable data collection methods can influence the accuracy of this method.
