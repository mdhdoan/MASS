   2. Abstract: The method presented here focuses on determining sample size for various variables. It leverages the work of Avery and Burkhart (1994) to establish sampling intensity in simple random samples. This approach ensures adequate representation and data quality while optimizing resources, making it essential when dealing with large populations or limited budgets.
   3. Description: The text discusses a method for determining sample size based on the variable being measured. It cites Avery and Burkhart's (1994) work to establish sampling intensity in simple random samples. This technique varies depending on the variable type, necessitating a tailored approach for each case. By accurately calculating sample size, researchers can ensure their samples are representative, reducing errors and improving results' reliability and validity.
   4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to provide a robust and adaptable approach to determining sample size in simple random sampling scenarios.
   5. Constraints: This method requires detailed knowledge of the variables being measured and their characteristics. Additionally, it assumes access to a sufficiently large population from which to draw the sample.
