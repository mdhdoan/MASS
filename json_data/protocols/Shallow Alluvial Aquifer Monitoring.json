  "background": "In an alluvial aquifer system that often in direct communication with surface water, groundwater monitoring is essential to understanding how the hydrologic system functions. Correlating groundwater levels to reaches of high seepage loss in rivers help to understand where and what kind of projects can help restore historic groundwater levels and increase stream flows.",
