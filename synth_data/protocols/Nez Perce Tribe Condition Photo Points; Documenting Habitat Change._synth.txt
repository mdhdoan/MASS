 1. Abstract: The text describes a protocol for monitoring long-term trends and changes in vegetation communities through the use of photographs taken at regular intervals and under consistent conditions. This allows for documentation of habitat status, plant cover, weed invasion, disturbances, and general health trends, as well as tracking succession on reclaimed sites.
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes: The value of this protocol lies in its ability to provide a visual record of changes in vegetation over time, which can help inform conservation efforts and land management decisions. The problem being addressed is the need for a method to track long-term trends and changes in vegetation communities. The desired outcome is to establish baseline conditions and quantitatively monitor habitat and plant growth.
3. Description: This protocol uses photographic methods to document changes in vegetation over time, with an emphasis on consistency and regularity. Photo points are used to capture images at approximately the same time each revisit, and the same azimuth is used to duplicate original photo orientation. The photographs will be used to track changes in vegetation cover, density, and composition. This information can help inform conservation efforts and land management decisions.
4. Objectives: The objective of this protocol is to establish a method for tracking long-term trends and changes in vegetation communities through the use of photographic records. This objective covers the entire problem statement, as the goal is to provide a solution for monitoring these changes over time. Keywords related to this objective include: photographic monitoring, long-term trends, vegetation communities, conservation, and land management.
5. Target: The primary focus of this protocol is on establishing a method for tracking long-term trends and changes in vegetation communities through the use of photographic records.
6. Constraints: Potential constraints for this protocol include limitations in access to reclaimed sites, weather conditions that may impact the ability to take photographs at regular intervals, and the need for consistent funding to support the ongoing implementation of this protocol.
