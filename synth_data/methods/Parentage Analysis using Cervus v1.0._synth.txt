 1. Keywords: Cervus software, genetic parentage analysis, likelihood, co-dominant genetic markers, microsatellites (STRs), SNPs, allozymes.
2. Abstract: The method described uses the Cervus software to perform genetic parentage analysis, a crucial step in identifying the parents of an offspring using genetic markers. This method employs likelihood, a well-established statistical technique, to assign parentage with high accuracy. The software can analyze data from various co-dominant genetic markers such as microsatellites (STRs), SNPs, and allozymes.
3. Description: Cervus is a computer program specifically designed for genetic parentage analysis, which involves assigning parents to their offspring using genetic markers. The software utilizes likelihood, a statistical method that calculates the probability of parentage based on the genetic data provided. It can analyze data from various co-dominant genetic markers such as microsatellites (STRs), SNPs, and allozymes. These markers are essential in providing reliable information about an individual's genetic makeup. The use of Cervus software for genetic parentage analysis is a crucial step in many fields, including wildlife biology, forensics, and medical research.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to accurately assign parentage using genetic markers and statistical methods.
5. Constraints: The accuracy of the Cervus software for genetic parentage analysis depends on several factors, such as the quality and quantity of the genetic data provided, the number of genetic markers used, and the degree of relationship between the potential parents and offspring. In some cases, it may be challenging to obtain sufficient genetic data or accurate genetic markers, which can limit the software's effectiveness.
