2. Abstract: This method involves the use of binned size classes for estimating the length of juvenile salmonids, rather than the previous approach of estimating to the nearest 10 mm increment. The new approach allows for more accurate density estimates of rearing juvenile salmonids in a stream reach impacted by a project, compared to a matched control reach. This before-after control-impact (BACI) experimental design helps assess the impact of the project on juvenile salmonid abundance.
3. Description: The new methodology for Version 2.0 focuses on using binned size classes instead of estimating juvenile salmonid lengths to the nearest 10 mm increment. This change provides more accurate length estimates, which in turn lead to improved density calculations for rearing juvenile salmonids in a specific stream reach. To properly evaluate the impact of a project on the juvenile salmonid population, the new approach employs a BACI experimental design. Here, an impact reach (where the project is taking place) is compared to a control reach (of identical length and size) on the same stream. By comparing data collected before and after the implementation of the project, researchers can assess whether the project has significantly affected juvenile salmonid abundance in the stream reach.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to enhance the accuracy of density estimates for rearing juvenile salmonids in a specific stream reach by utilizing binned size classes and comparing impacted reaches against control reaches using a BACI experimental design.
5. Constraints: This method requires sufficient knowledge about the target species, their length distributions, and stream ecology to establish appropriate bin sizes and select suitable control reaches. Additionally, this approach necessitates consistent monitoring before and after project implementation to accurately gauge potential impacts on juvenile salmonid populations.
