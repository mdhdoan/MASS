  "abstractText": "This method is derived from an Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) protocol developed for monitoring western wadable streams. Included in this method are instructions for semi-quantitatively evaluating the type and amount of important types of cover for fish and macroinvertebrates - using a visual estimation procedure. Alone and in combination with other metrics, this information is used to assess habitat complexity, fish cover, and channel disturbance.",
