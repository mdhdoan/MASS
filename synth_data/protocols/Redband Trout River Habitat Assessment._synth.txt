 Sure, I'd be happy to help label the topics and provide an overview of the text body based on the requested sections. Here are my suggestions:

1. Abstract: The text describes a protocol for evaluating the habitat of Redband Trout in riverine systems within the upper Columbia River basin. With the construction of Grand Coulee Dam in 1939, the anadromous life history form of Redband Trout was eliminated from the upper Columbia River, and isolated populations and habitats were likely created. However, comprehensive habitat assessments have not been completed in certain river systems containing Redband Trout populations. The protocol aims to identify habitat parameters that influence Redband Trout population characteristics in river systems and assess river habitat that contains Redband Trout populations.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes:
	* Values: Understanding and preserving the habitats of native fish species like Redband Trout is valuable for maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance.
	* Problem Statement: The migration of anadromous Redband Trout was eliminated from the upper Columbia River with the construction of Grand Coulee Dam, likely isolating populations and habitats of potamodromous Redband Trout. Comprehensive habitat assessments have not been completed in certain river systems containing these populations.
	* Desired outcomes: The desired outcome is to identify habitat parameters that influence Redband Trout population characteristics in river systems and assess river habitat that contains Redband Trout populations. This will allow managers to better understand Redband Trout population characteristics and identify habitat factors that may influence populations, which can inform conservation efforts.
3. Description: The text describes a protocol for evaluating the habitat of Redband Trout in riverine systems within the upper Columbia River basin. The methods used will depend on the limitations of data collection within each watershed. The protocol aims to identify habitat parameters that influence Redband Trout population characteristics in river systems and assess river habitat that contains Redband Trout populations. Habitat assessments are necessary for understanding Redband Trout population characteristics and identifying habitat factors that may influence populations, which can inform conservation efforts.
4. Objectives:
	* Describe the objective in detail: The objective is to identify habitat parameters that influence Redband Trout population characteristics in river systems and assess river habitat that contains Redband Trout populations.
	* Summary of Solution Coverage: The protocol covers the entire problem statement, as it aims to address the need for comprehensive habitat assessments in river systems containing Redband Trout populations.
	* Keywords: Redband Trout, habitat assessment, riverine systems, upper Columbia River basin, habitat parameters, conservation, population characteristics, isolated populations.
5. Target: The primary focus of the protocol is to identify habitat parameters that influence Redband Trout population characteristics in river systems and assess river habitat that contains Redband Trout populations.
6. Constraints: There may be limitations in data collection within each watershed, which could affect the methods used in the habitat assessment.
