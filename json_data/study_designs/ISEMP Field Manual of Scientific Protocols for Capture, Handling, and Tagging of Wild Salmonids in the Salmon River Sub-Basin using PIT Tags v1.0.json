  "backgroundRationale": "<p>The goal of the Salmon ISEMP project is to measure the freshwater productivity of salmonids for the purposes of evaluating the effectiveness of habitat actions at improving freshwater productivity and to determine the relationships between status and trends in habitat quality and availability and status and trends of salmonid freshwater productivity. Effectively measuring freshwater productivity is complicated by the fact the distribution of juvenile salmonids is largely unknown for much of their life history. Further, until recently, the application of unique marks has been largely limited to juveniles greater than 60mm fork length. In order to address these complexities, juvenile sampling associated with the Salmon ISEMP is distributed using a spatially-balanced design (generalized random tessellation survey (GRTS). This protocol focuses on how sampling effort is distributed, criteria for rejecting probabilistically selected sites, and methods for juvenile capture and tagging at remaining sites.</p>\r\n",
