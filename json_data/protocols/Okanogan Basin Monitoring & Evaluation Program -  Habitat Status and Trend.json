  "background": "OBMEP is a long term status and trends monitoring program that collects data on habitat conditions for salmonids in their freshwater life stages. OBMEP Habitat Monitoring methods were developed according to the Monitoring Strategy for the Upper Columbia Basin (2004) by Tracy Hillman, and aligned with the methods of the Collaborative Systemwide Monitoring & Evaluation Program (CSMEP), the Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Partnership (PNAMP) and originally implemented following the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP). To ensure compatibility with other regional and basin wide projects, OBMEP coordinates with multiple disciplines and agencies throughout the Okanogan River Basin, Columbia Cascade Province, and Columbia River Basin.",
