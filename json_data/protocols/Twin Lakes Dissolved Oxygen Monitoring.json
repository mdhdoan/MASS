  "background": "A hypolimneticoxygenation (HO) system has been operational throughout the open-water season in North Twin Lake (NT) since May 12, 2009 with the main goal of increasing suitable trout habitat availability. Suitable trout habitat for long-term survival has been defined as  21 C and  4.25 mg/L dissolved oxygen (DO) (Davis 1975,Overholtz et al. 1977, Wydoski and Whitney 2003). The target level of DO throughout the hypolimnion with oxygenation is 4.25 mg/L. This project providesthe unique opportunity of studying NT before/after HO as well as a side-by-side comparison with un-oxygenated ST. We hypothesized that HO would expand suitable trout habitat in NT while trout habitat would remain restricted in un-oxygenated ST by a hypoxic hypolimnion.During 20112013, to create more trout habitat, NT was oxygenated from June 1  October 18, May 24  October 23, and May 24  mid-October in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. A total of 10,045,096, 8,231,850, and 10,133,800 cu. ft of liquid oxygen were delivered for injection into NT in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. Winter DO depletion rates were also monitored to determine sediment oxygen demand and to identify trends in HO reducing those demands. In theory, as NT is oxygenated, sediment oxygen demand will decrease over time as the legacy nutrients are oxidized.",
