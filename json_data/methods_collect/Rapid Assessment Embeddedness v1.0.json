  "abstractText": "Embeddedness is the extent that larger cobbles or gravel are surrounded by or covered by finesediment, such as sands, silts, and clays. Embeddedness is determined by examining the extent (as an average %) that cobble and gravel particles on the substrate surface are buried by fine sediments. This attribute only applies to riffle and tailout habitat units and only where cobble or gravel substrates occur. Embeddedness is measured in the field to the nearest 5%.",
