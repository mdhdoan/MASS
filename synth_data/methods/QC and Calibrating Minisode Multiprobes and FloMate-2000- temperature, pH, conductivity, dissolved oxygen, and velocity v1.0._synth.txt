 1. Keywords: verifying in situ meters, calibrating instruments, probes (temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen), water velocity instrument (Marsh-McBirney FloMate-2000)
2. Abstract: This method outlines the process of ensuring that in situ meters are functioning accurately to collect valid data for environmental monitoring. Regular verification and calibration of probes and water velocity instruments, such as Minisonde Multiprobes and Marsh-McBirney FloMate-2000, ensure high-quality results. The method should be performed by trained personnel before and after each sampling event to maintain data integrity.
3. Description: This text details a method for confirming the proper operation of in situ meters, specifically focusing on calibrating various probes (temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen) and an instrument used for measuring water velocity (Marsh-McBirney FloMate-2000). The procedure is to be carried out by one or more trained individuals during every data collection event. Regular verification and calibration are essential both before and after sampling, although some tasks may not need to be conducted as frequently.
4. Target: Ensuring accurate data collection through regular in situ meter verification and calibration
5. Constraints: The method requires trained personnel to perform the procedure accurately and consistently, with specific instruments (Minisonde Multiprobes and Marsh-McBirney FloMate-2000) needed for probes and water velocity measurement respectively. Regular resource allocation is necessary for consistent adherence to this method at every data collection event.
