 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the text body you provided, here are five relevant keywords:

1. Channel Class
2. Classification system
3. Montgomery and Buffington (1993)
4. Simplification
5. Criteria

Now, let's fill out the rest of the sections based on the information given:

2. Abstract:
The method developed by Montgomery and Buffington (1993) for Channel Class classification is a detailed and technical system. However, this criteria for Channel Class provides a simplified version of that system. The need for a simplified classification system arises from the complexity of the original, which can be challenging to use in certain applications. The simplified criteria maintain the essence of the Montgomery and Buffington (1993) system while making it more accessible and straightforward.
3. Description:
The text body describes a simplification of the classification system developed by Montgomery and Buffington (1993) for Channel Class. The author explains that the simplified criteria are necessary due to the complexity of the original system. The new criteria maintain the core principles of the original system while making it easier to use and understand. The specifics of the simplified criteria are not provided in the text body, but the author emphasizes that it is a simplification of Montgomery and Buffington (1993).
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the method described in the text body is to provide a simplified version of the Channel Class classification system developed by Montgomery and Buffington (1993).
5. Constraints:
The constraints for this method are not explicitly stated in the text body. However, it can be implied that the constraint is the complexity of the original classification system developed by Montgomery and Buffington (1993). The author aims to address this constraint by providing a simplified version of the system while maintaining its core principles.
