  "abstractText": "This document is the Environmental Assessment Program (EAP) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for obtaining freshwater sediment samples with a grab sampler. This SOP covers collection of sediment for chemistry or bioassay analyses using equipment including Petite Ponar, Ponar, Ekman, and Van Veen designs. It is not intended to serve as a comprehensive review of other samplers and equipment which can also be used. For information on other types of samplers, see, for example, EPA (2001).This SOP should be followed for freshwater sediment collection activities performed with grab samplers to obtain samples for chemistry or bioassay analyses. The SOP does not apply to the collection of freshwater benthic invertebrates. The use of core samplers with freshwater sediments is covered by a separate SOP (Ecology, 2008).This SOP does not apply to sample collection in marine or estuarine waters, which should generally conform with recommendations in Puget Sound Protocols (PSEP, 1997a) and Ecology recommendations (Ecology, 2003). An SOP is available for Puget Sound Assessment and Monitoring Program (PSAMP) Marine Sediment Component collection activities performed by Ecologys Marine Monitoring Unit (Ecology, 2007).",
