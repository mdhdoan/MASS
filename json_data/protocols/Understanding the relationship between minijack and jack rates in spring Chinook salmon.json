  "background": "Test the Hypothesis: Spring Chinook salmon stocks that possess an increased propensity for minijack maturation will also possess an increased propensity for jack maturationThis investigation will involve rearing a stock of fish withhigh propensity for minijack maturationand a stock of fish withlow propensity for minijack maturationhatchery spring Chinook salmonunder a high and low growth regime and evaluate minijack and jack maturation rates. This study will also evaluate growth profiles that increase and decrease the propensity for early male maturation (minijack and jack) in stocks with variable genetic thresholds for expressing these life histories in order to develop hatchery rearing regimes for BPA and other sponsored hatchery programs.",
