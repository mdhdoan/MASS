  "abstract": " This method refers to the process of identifying and documenting non-monumented sites, which are locations without permanent markers such as rebar or reference trees. These sites have important coordinate information but lack permanent markers. By establishing site names, latitudes, longitudes, watersheds, subbasins, and streamnames, along with the start and stop coordinates or site lengths if data is collected in multiple places within a site, we ensure that these locations can be accurately located and referenced for future use. This process is crucial to maintain reliable data and effectively manage resources associated with these sites. It solves issues of potential confusion or lost information by providing clear, accessible details about each location.\n\nHere's a simplified version without code:\nWe create a method to document non-monumented sites - locations without permanent markers but have essential coordinate information. By assigning site names, watersheds, subbasins, streamnames, and recording start/stop coordinates or site lengths, we can maintain precise records for future reference and effective resource management. This approach helps avoid potential confusion and loss of critical data."

  "description": " This text describes the process for establishing and labeling non-monumented sites, which are geographical locations without permanent marker information. These sites can be identified using coordinate data, specifically their latitudes and longitudes. The site nomenclature, watersheds, subbasins, and associated stream names are also required metadata. In some instances, the start and stop coordinates or site lengths may need to be recorded if data is collected in multiple locations within a single site.\n\nIn detail, the process involves:\n1. Determining the location of non-monumented sites using their respective coordinate information.\n2. Assigning established names to each site.\n3. Categorizing sites based on their watersheds and subbasins.\n4. Recording the names of associated streams or water bodies.\n5. When necessary, identifying the start and stop coordinates or calculating the length of a site when data is gathered from multiple locations.\n\nIn order to implement this process in code, you can create a class or dictionary to store site information including name, location (latitude and longitude), watershed, subbasin, stream names, start and stop coordinates, and site length. Utilize functions or methods to establish new sites by assigning them names, categorizing based on watersheds and subbasins, and recording associated metadata. For multi-location data collection, implement functions that allow for the calculation of site length and storage of start and stop coordinates."

  "constraints": " Based on the given text, the following constraints apply to the method for establishing non-monumented sites:\n1. The site does not have permanent marker information associated with it (e.g., rebar, bearing trees, reference locations).\n2. The site has an established name, latitudes and longitudes, watersheds, subbasins, and streamnames associated with it.\n3. If data is collected in multiple places within a site, the start and stop coordinates or site lengths are required.\n\nThe text explicitly states these constraints at different points:\n- \"Non monumented sites have coordinate information but do not have permanent marker information associated with the site.\" (Constraint 1)\n- \"Sites should have established site names, latitudes and longitudes, watersheds, subbasin and streamnames associated with them.\" (Constraints 2 and 3, as watersheds, subbasins, and streamnames are required metadata for each site)\n- \"Start and stop coordinates of sites or site lengths are also required if data is colllected in multiple places within a site.\" (Constraint 3)"
