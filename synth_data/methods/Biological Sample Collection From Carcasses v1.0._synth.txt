2. Abstract: This method involves the collection and analysis of biological samples from spring and summer Chinook salmon, Coho salmon, and steelhead carcasses to determine their age, origin, stock, and health status. The process includes collecting dorsal fin rays, genetic tissue, snouts, and otoliths, which provide valuable information used in fisheries management and conservation efforts.

3. Description: Biological samples are collected from spring and summer Chinook salmon, Coho salmon, and steelhead carcasses during their spawning season. The collection methods for dorsal fin rays, genetic tissue, snouts, and otoliths are described in detail. Dorsal fin rays can reveal the age of the fish by counting the number of growth rings. Genetic tissue samples help identify the origin and stock of individual fish through DNA analysis. Snouts contain chemical signals that indicate the geographic location where the fish spent its juvenile stage. Otoliths, or ear stones, provide information about the fish's age, growth rate, migration patterns, and environmental conditions experienced throughout its life.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to gather essential data for fisheries management and conservation by assessing the age, origin, stock, and health status of salmonid populations.

5. Constraints: This method requires careful handling and processing of biological samples to ensure accurate results. Collection timing and location are crucial factors that may affect sample quality and representativeness. Additionally, advanced laboratory equipment and specialized knowledge in fish biology, genetics, and chemistry are necessary for proper analysis and interpretation of the samples.
