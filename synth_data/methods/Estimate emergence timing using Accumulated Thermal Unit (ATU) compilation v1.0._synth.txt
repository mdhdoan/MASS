1. Emergence timing
2. Egg pocket temperature
3. Spawning progress
4. Accumulated thermal units (ATU)
5. Laboratory experiment

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
This method describes a way to estimate the emergence timing of chum salmon in the Ives Island area using the daily average egg pocket temperature and the progress of spawning. The estimation is calculated at two different Accumulated Thermal Units (ATU) levels, which have been determined based on historical use and laboratory experiments. This method provides a more accurate and timely way to predict emergence timing, which is crucial for management and conservation efforts.
3. Description:
The method involves summing the daily average egg pocket temperature starting from four different times: initiation of spawning, 10% of spawning completed, 50% of spawning completed, and 90% of spawning completed. The percentage of spawning completed is determined using weekly redd counts in the Ives Island area obtained from the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. Emergence is calculated at two different ATU levels: 825 ATU and 932 ATU. The first level represents the onset of emergence, while the second level represents the mean temperature unit level at which 50% emergence occurred in control fish during a laboratory experiment conducted at PNNL.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide an accurate and timely estimation of chum salmon emergence timing in the Ives Island area, which can inform management and conservation efforts.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is that it relies on the availability and accuracy of weekly redd counts in the Ives Island area. Additionally, while the ATU levels have been determined based on historical use and laboratory experiments, there may be variability in emergence timing due to other environmental factors.
