2. Abstract: This method describes a procedure to estimate the percentage of hatchery-released fish that strayed from their intended path. By using coded wire tags and tracking their recovery locations, researchers can determine if a tagged fish moved outside the direct migratory route between the ocean and its release river basin. With a minimum of 35 tag recoveries, this method allows for accurate estimation of straying behavior, contributing to better hatchery management and wildlife conservation efforts.
3. Description: The methodology discussed in the text involves tagging a portion or all of a hatchery release group with coded wire tags, ensuring at least 35 recoveries based on historical data. A fish is considered to have strayed if it is recovered outside of the direct migratory path between the ocean and its river basin of release. The text refers users to methods 4223 and 5526 for specifics on coded wire tagging techniques, as well as Johnson (1990) for a detailed description of coded wire tagging operations in the Pacific Northwest. Clarke et al. (2016) provides an example of this method applied in a published study.
4. Target: The primary focus is to develop a reliable method for estimating stray rates within hatchery release groups using coded wire tags and tag recovery data.
5. Constraints: To apply the method effectively, sufficient resources must be allocated for hatchery management, tagging operations, and monitoring to ensure at least 35 recoveries for accurate estimation.
