 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the keywords that I have identified from the text body:

1. Hydroacoustic methods
2. Fish population assessment
3. Sonar systems
4. DIDSON (a type of sonar)
5. Mixed species apportionment

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract:
Hydroacoustic methods are commonly used in assessing fish populations in rivers, especially when other techniques such as weirs and observation towers are not feasible. Hydroacoustic systems offer several advantages over more intrusive devices like nets or traps, including the ability to operate in wider and turbid rivers. This method focuses on using hydroacoustic systems from fixed, nearshore positions to assess migrating fish populations. However, there are several conditions that must be met before a sonar system can be used effectively, such as active migration of fish, detection range, river bottom profile, and species identification.
3. Description:
The text describes the use of hydroacoustic methods in rivers for assessing fish populations. Hydroacoustic systems offer several advantages over other methods, including the ability to operate in wider and more turbid waters where traditional methods may not be effective. The text discusses several types of sonars that have been used for this purpose, as well as the conditions that must be met for successful enumeration of migrating fish. These conditions include active migration, detection range, river bottom profile, and species identification. If multiple species are present, an alternative technique must be used to apportion the sonar numbers to species.
4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to use hydroacoustic systems in rivers from fixed, nearshore positions to assess migrating fish populations while minimizing handling and mortality associated with other methods.
5. Constraints:
There are several constraints to using hydroacoustic systems for fish population assessment. Firstly, fish must be actively migrating within the detection range of the sonar system. Secondly, the river bottom profile must be mostly linear with laminar current flow. Thirdly, either the species of interest is the only species present or an alternative technique must be used to apportion the sonar numbers to species. Lastly, capture techniques such as gillnetting, beach seining, fish wheels, or other methods are not used for abundance estimates at these sites due to variable water levels and fish densities.
