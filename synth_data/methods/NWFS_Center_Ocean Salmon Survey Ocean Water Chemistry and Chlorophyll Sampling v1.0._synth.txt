2. Abstract: 
This study, funded by the Bonneville Power Administration, aims to understand coastal ecosystems and biological and physical processes affecting salmon recruitment variability in Pacific Northwest waters. The research focuses on examining how biotic and abiotic environmental conditions influence the early marine life history of coho and Chinook salmon, particularly in the Columbia River Plume. This area is critical for juvenile salmon and higher trophic level predators due to its high abundance of salmonids, and it is impacted by human activities.

3. Description: 
The Bonneville Power Administration funds this long-term effort to investigate coastal ecosystems and biological and physical processes affecting the recruitment variability of salmon in Pacific Northwest waters. Currently, researchers are focusing on the effects of biotic and abiotic environmental factors on the early marine life history of coho and Chinook salmon. The Columbia River Plume is a key area of interest because it has high abundances of juvenile salmon and higher trophic level predators and is influenced by anthropogenic factors. Understanding how these conditions affect salmon survival in the plume will help inform management decisions regarding salmon conservation and restoration efforts in the region.

4. Target: 
The primary focus of this method is to understand the effects of environmental conditions on coho and Chinook salmon recruitment variability in Pacific Northwest waters.

5. Constraints: 
One constraint for this research is that it relies on funding from the Bonneville Power Administration, which may impact the scope and duration of the study. Additionally, the complexity of coastal ecosystems and the presence of multiple variables affecting salmon survival may pose challenges in identifying clear causal relationships between environmental conditions and salmon recruitment variability.
