2. Abstract: This text discusses a recent publication that suggests a tradeoff between hatchery success and wild reproductive success in domestications of various families. The study also proposes that high-density environments may enhance the rate of domestication, leading to the prediction that family performance rankings will depend on the density at which they were raised.
3. Description: The text discusses a study by Christie et al. (2012) and Ford et al. (2012), which found that families with high hatchery success may have lower reproductive success in the wild, suggesting a tradeoff caused by domestication. The study also presents circumstantial evidence indicating that crowding may enhance the rate of domestication, potentially leading to fish adapting to high-density environments. A prediction based on this hypothesis is that family performance rankings (growth rate) will depend on the density at which they were raised. This means that families with high growth rates in low-density environments may have lower growth rates in high-density environments, and vice versa. The text also references Thompson and Blouin (2015) for further details.
4. Target: To investigate the tradeoff between hatchery success and wild reproductive success in domestications of various families and its implications on fish adaptation.
5. Constraints: Further research is needed to confirm the hypothesis that crowding enhances the rate of domestication, as well as the prediction that family performance rankings depend on the density at which they were raised.
