2. Abstract: The text describes a method used for identifying and radio-tagging specific returns of juvenile Fall Chinook salmon at Lower Granite Dam. An automated sorting system using PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) tags tracks the fish and separates them into a trap. Once collected, they are calmed in an anesthetic tank and scanned for PIT tags. The display of specific action codes on a monitor screen indicates which fish to collect scales from and insert radio tags. This process enables researchers to study and monitor the movement and behavior of these fish more effectively.
3. Description: The methodology outlined involves the use of an automated sorting system at Lower Granite Dam, designed to capture specific returns of juvenile Fall Chinook salmon fitted with PIT tags. When a tagged fish passes through the system, it triggers an action code on the monitor screen for those selected in the radio tagging study. This allows workers to identify and extract the targeted fish from the trap using a unique anesthetic tank technique. Each fish is then scanned individually to confirm its identity, collect scales, and insert a radio tag. This approach ensures proper identification of individual fish while minimizing stress levels for efficient radio-tagging.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to effectively identify and radio-tag specific returns of juvenile Fall Chinook salmon in the context of a broader study on their movement and behavior.
5. Constraints: While not explicitly stated, constraints for this method may include ensuring adequate water quality conditions to minimize stress for captured fish, maintaining precise control over anesthetic concentrations in the tank, accurate scanning and identification of PIT tags, timely insertion of radio tags, and careful handling of collected scales.
