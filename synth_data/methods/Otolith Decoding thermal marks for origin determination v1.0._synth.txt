2. Abstract: Thermal marking of bony structures is a critical method for identifying the origin of adult chum salmon upon their return to spawning grounds. This technique allows for marking with no impact on the fish, and can be done while the eggs or fry are still in the incubation trays. A schedule of thermal changes applied during incubation produces a unique and recognizable bar code-like mark, which is essential for monitoring and evaluating enhancement or reintroduction programs.
3. Description: Traditional marking techniques such as Carlson-type tag (CWT), Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT), fin clips, or maxillary clips are not feasible for small chum salmon fry due to their size at emigration. Although fin or maxillary clips can be applied if the fry are reared to a larger size, they carry additional stresses, risks, and costs. In contrast, thermal marking of bony structures has no impact on the fish and is cost-effective. By applying a schedule of thermal changes during incubation, a bar code-like mark can be created that is unique and recognizable. This method is crucial for the monitoring and evaluation of enhancement or reintroduction programs as it enables accurate identification of project origin adults upon their return.
4. Target: The primary goal of thermal marking of bony structures is to provide a reliable, non-invasive, and cost-effective method for identifying the origin of adult chum salmon upon their return to spawning grounds.
5. Constraints: The constraints for thermal marking of bony structures include the need for precise control over incubation temperatures and timing, as well as the requirement for specialized equipment and expertise to interpret the resulting bar code-like marks accurately. Additionally, this method may not be suitable for all salmonid species or populations, particularly those with different life histories or temperature tolerances.
