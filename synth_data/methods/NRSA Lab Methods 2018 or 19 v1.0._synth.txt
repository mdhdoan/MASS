 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the keywords I have extracted from the text body:

1. EPA NARS lab methods
2. Algal toxin immunoassay (cylindrospermopsin and microcystin)
3. Benthic macroinvertebrates
4. Fecal indicator (enterococcus)
5. Fish voucher specimens, tissue fillet, and plug

Now, let's create an abstract, description, target, and constraints based on the given text body:

1. Abstract:
The EPA NARS lab methods for the 2018-2019 National Rivers and Streams Assessment include procedures for analyzing algal toxins, benthic macroinvertebrates, fecal indicators, fish voucher specimens, and water chemistry. The immunoassay procedures for cylindrospermopsin and microcystin algal toxins help ensure the safety of recreational waters and aquatic ecosystems. Benthic macroinvertebrates are used as bioindicators to assess water quality, while enterococcus serves as a fecal indicator to detect contamination in water. Fish voucher specimens, tissue fillet, and plug methods support the preservation and analysis of fish for ecological studies. Lastly, the water chemistry method measures various parameters, including chlorophyll-a, to evaluate water quality.
2. Description:
The EPA NARS lab methods document details various laboratory procedures for the National Rivers and Streams Assessment in 2018-2019. Specifically, it includes two immunoassay procedures for detecting algal toxins - cylindrospermopsin and microcystin. These procedures involve sample preparation, reagent addition, and data interpretation. The benthic macroinvertebrate method entails collecting, sorting, identifying, and preserving organisms for further analysis. The fecal indicator method detects enterococcus bacteria in water samples using membrane filtration. Fish voucher specimens are collected and preserved as whole fish or tissue plugs for future analysis, while fish tissue fillet involves collecting a sample of fish flesh for chemical analysis. Periphyton blooms and metagenomics methods support research efforts to understand aquatic ecosystems better. Lastly, the water chemistry method measures various parameters, such as nutrients, pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen, in water samples using standard procedures.
3. Target:
The primary focus of the EPA NARS lab methods is to provide a comprehensive set of laboratory procedures for analyzing various aspects of water quality, including algal toxins, benthic macroinvertebrates, fecal indicators, fish, and water chemistry.
4. Constraints:
The constraints for the current method include the need for specialized equipment and trained personnel to perform the laboratory procedures accurately and reliably. Additionally, some methods require specific reagents or supplies that may not be readily available or affordable for all laboratories. Finally, adhering to strict quality control measures and following established protocols is essential to ensure accurate and reliable results.
