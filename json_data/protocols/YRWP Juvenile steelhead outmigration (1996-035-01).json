  "background": "We use rotary screw traps on Satus, Toppenish, and Ahtanum to estimate juvenile steelhead outmigrant abundance, and also timing, and downstream survival. Traps are operated continuously during the juvenile migration period roughly from October through June. Target fish are marked with PIT tags and released upstream as part of a mark-recapture study and used to generate the outmigrant estimates. These estimates are used to evaluate the viability of identified rearing habitat in the tributaries and to direct restoration and resource management decisions and actions. PIT tagged steelhead juvenile downstream detections are also used by others to evaluate timing and downstream survival.",
