2. Abstract: The necessity for accurate estimation of anadromous fish populations, such as adult salmon, is critical for effective conservation and management strategies. A new method called DABOM (Dam Adult Branch Occupancy Model) has been developed to address this challenge. Utilizing a subset of PIT-tagged adult salmon, DABOM generates estimates of escapement at various spatial scales, from major population groups to specific spawning areas. By incorporating the branching structure of a stream network and accounting for imperfect detection probabilities and movement past detection locations, DABOM provides a comprehensive approach to estimating anadromous fish abundance. This method is detailed in Waterhouse et al. (2020).
3. Description: The DABOM method is based on the utilization of PIT-tagged adult salmon, which are detected in upstream tributaries after being tagged at a primary sampling facility like a dam. The method integrates the branching structure of a stream network and simultaneously estimates imperfect detection probabilities at all detection locations and movement probabilities past detection locations. These movement probabilities, when correctly multiplied and combined with an estimate of total abundance at the tagging site, enable estimation of abundance at various spatial scales. DABOM is described in further detail in Waterhouse et al. (2020).
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of the method is to accurately estimate the abundance of anadromous fishes like adult salmon at multiple spatial scales, from major population groups to specific spawning areas, by using a subset of PIT-tagged fish and taking into account the branching structure of stream networks.
5. Constraints: The DABOM method requires accurate detection and tracking of PIT-tagged fish in upstream tributaries, as well as sufficient data on the branching structure of the stream network. Additionally, estimating imperfect detection probabilities and movement past detection locations may introduce potential sources of error or uncertainty.
