2. Abstract: This method describes the process of collecting a sample from a fish's dorsal fin for analysis. By following this procedure, researchers can obtain a small piece of the knobby ends of the bony fin rays while avoiding muscle tissue. The collected sample is then documented with relevant information and prepared for storage or transportation.
3. Description: The method begins by pulling up on the dorsal fin of the fish, followed by using a knife to make a parallel cut along the fish's back to isolate the knobby ends of the bony fin rays. It is crucial to avoid including muscle tissue in the sample to maintain its integrity and prevent contamination. Once the sample has been obtained, the researcher must fill out required information such as stream, date, species, sex, fork length, and meps length. The UTM coordinates of the collection site should also be recorded. This detailed data aids in tracking, comparing, and analyzing samples effectively. Finally, the completed form is placed in an envelope and sealed for safekeeping and transport.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to collect and document a fish's dorsal fin sample accurately and systematically.
5. Constraints: Some constraints for this method include ensuring precise cutting techniques to avoid muscle tissue contamination, careful documentation of all required information, and accurate recording of UTM coordinates for proper sample tracking and comparison.
