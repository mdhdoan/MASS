  "id": 2172,
  "assumptions": "<p>1) eDNA in the water column is shed from a living organism or a recent corpse of the target species or taxonomic group;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) eDNA does not move counter to the flow of water and does not enter the water column from a reservoir in sediments;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) eDNA is not appreciably moved by predators/parasites or derive from anthropogenic sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
  "objectives": [
    "The objectives of eDNA monitoring are to identify the presence of DNA fragments in environmental samples that are diagnostic of the recent proximity of individuals of a species or set of species."
