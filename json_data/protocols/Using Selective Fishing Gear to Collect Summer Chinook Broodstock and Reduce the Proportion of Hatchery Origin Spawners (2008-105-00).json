  "background": "The Colville Tribes are facilitating the development of a locally-adapted, self-sustaining, Okanogan River summer/fall Chinook salmon population. The Selective Gear Deployment project (2008-105-00) in the Upper Columbia region uses selective fishing techniques and selective harvest gear to collect both the natural-origin and hatchery-origin summer/fall Chinook broodstock needed for the integrated and segregated programs at the Chief Joseph Hatchery (CJH), and; to reduce the proportion of hatchery-originspawners(pHOS) reaching spawning areas of theOkanoganRiver basin. It is hoped that a future listing of summer/fall Chinook under the ESA will be prevented by these efforts. The project builds upon the lessons learned during implementation of the Evaluate Live Capture Gear project (2007-249-00).",
