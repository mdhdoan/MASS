 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are five relevant keywords for the text body you provided:

1. Continuous temperature monitoring
2. Ambient stream sampling network
3. Clean Water Act
4. SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
5. Stream temperature criteria

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract:
This document outlines the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for collecting and assessing continuous temperature monitoring results from Ecology's statewide ambient stream sampling network. The purpose of the continuous temperature monitoring program is to collect diel stream temperature data, which can be used to expand the interpretation of a station's ambient monitoring results and determine its compliance with state water quality standards. The SOP covers the installation and maintenance of continuous temperature ambient monitoring stations and reflects guidelines from various sources.
3. Description:
The text details the SOP for collecting and assessing continuous temperature monitoring results from Ecology's statewide ambient stream sampling network. The purpose of the program is to collect diel stream temperature data, which can be used to expand the interpretation of a station's ambient monitoring results and determine its compliance with state water quality standards. The SOP outlines the protocols for installing and maintaining continuous temperature ambient monitoring stations, which reflect guidelines from sources such as the TFW Stream Temperature Survey Manual (Schuett-Hames et al., 1999), Continuous Temperature Sampling Protocols for the Environmental Monitoring and Trends Section (Ward, 2003), Measuring Stream Temperature with Digital Data Loggers (USFS, 2005), and Standard Operating Procedures for continuous temperature monitoring of fresh water rivers and streams conducted in a Total Maximum.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the method is to establish a standard operating procedure for collecting and assessing continuous temperature monitoring results from Ecology's statewide ambient stream sampling network, which can be used to determine compliance with state water quality standards.
5. Constraints:
There are several constraints for the current method, including the need for consecutive days of stream temperature measurement to apply the criterion under the Clean Water Act (Section 303(d)). Additionally, the SOP must reflect guidelines from various sources, such as the TFW Stream Temperature Survey Manual and Continuous Temperature Sampling Protocols for the Environmental Monitoring and Trends Section. The installation and maintenance of continuous temperature ambient monitoring stations may also be subject to resource constraints.
