  "abstractText": "Recently the male sex determining gene on the Y-chromosome (sDY) inO. mykisswas discovered by Yanoet al. 2012a. Genetic males can be identified by the verifying the presence of this gene in genomic DNA isolated from either red blood cells or small pieces of fin tissue using PCR. Themethod forPCR amplification of sDY was based on primers reported by Yano et al., 2012a,b. The method was modified from their work with the isolation of genomic DNA using Chelex resin from BioRad (Richland, CA) to reduce costs of this assay.",
