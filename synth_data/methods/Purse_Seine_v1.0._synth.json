  "abstract": " The purse seine fishing method involves using a boat, a smaller skiff, and a large net to capture fish in open-water environments. This method is effective in various water bodies, including lentic and lotic ones without submerged obstructions. Purposefully designed not to entangle fish, this type of netting is ideal for catch-and-release programs and selective harvest initiatives.\n\nThe net length, depth, and mesh size are customized depending on the fishing area's physical dimensions and bathymetry. For areas with potential bottom contact, chafing gear is added to prevent damage. When deployed, the net hangs vertically in the water, weighted at the bottom and buoyed at the top.\n\nWhen it's time to set the net, the bag end is held stationary while the boat deploys the net in a U-shape. The net is then towed from both ends in a horseshoe shape to encircle the fish. Care must be taken to avoid overloading the net and causing unnecessary fish mortality.\n\nOnce the net is closed, the gear is hauled aboard as quickly as possible to minimize time spent in the net and reduce unwanted mortality. The net is then stacked on the larger boat for easy deployment of the next set.\n\nUnlike traditional methods, this technique keeps the fish in the money bag (netting compartment) and sorts them by hand before removing them from the water. This approach ensures minimal disturbance to non-target species and allows for selective harvesting of specific fish populations. \n\nIn summary, the purse seine fishing method is an efficient, selective, and humane way to capture fish in various water bodies while minimizing unintended consequences and respecting natural populations."

  "description": " The purse seine fishing method involves utilizing specialized equipment, including a Seine boat, a smaller Skiff, and a purse seine net. In marine environments with high fish concentrations, open-water or lentic/lotically challenged waters without submerged obstructions, purse seines have proven successful. These nets are designed to impound rather than entangle fish, making them ideal for catch-and-release data collection and selective harvest programs where fish mortality must be minimized.\n\nThe net length and depth depend on the specific fishing area's physical dimensions and bathymetry. Mesh size is crucial in reducing fish wedging or gilling. An extra foot of mesh per fathom of corkline and a 10% shorter leadline are standard practices.\n\nPurse seine nets operate near water surfaces without disturbing the bottom substrate, but modifications like chafing gear are implemented when fishing in contact-bottom areas. Chafing gear, a smaller mesh strip attached to the midrib's bottom edge, resists snagging on submerged obstructions while minimizing damage to the net.\n\nTo set the net, the skiff holds the bag end stationary as the seiner deploys it in a U-shape and clears debris from the deck. The net is then towed evenly in a horseshoe shape until boats come together for closing the net. Careful consideration of set duration prevents net overload and fish mortality.\n\nOnce closed, the net's gear is hauled aboard using an hydraulic powerblock while maintaining a quick retrieval to minimize fish time in the net. Nets are stacked carefully with corkline coiled separately from leadline for efficient deployment of subsequent sets. All fish and debris must be removed prior to traveling over the power block to avoid stoppages increasing fish exposure to the net.\n\nUnlike traditional purse seine methods, fish remain in the money bag, allowing sorting by species, size, sex, origin, or other criteria with non-target fish returned to the river promptly. Natural-origin (NOR) and hatchery-origin (HOR) Chinook adults are selectively collected for broodstock, while NORs not taken and non-target fish are released. HORs and targeted species are harvested for tribal ceremonial and subsistence use according to their respective allocations."

  "constraints": " Based on the provided text, here are some constraints applicable to the purse seine fishing method and where they are stated:\n\n1. The method is typically utilized in open-water environments with high fish concentrations (line 2).\n2. Seine nets are designed not to entangle fish but to impound them (lines 5-6).\n3. Net length, net depth, and mesh size are determined by the physical dimensions and bathymetry of specific fishing areas (lines 9-10).\n4. Chafing gear is added when fishing in areas where the net will come in contact with the bottom substrate to prevent snagging on submerged obstructions (lines 13-16).\n5. Good judgement must be used in determining the duration of a set to prevent net overload and unwanted fish mortality (line 22).\n6. Both ends of the purse line are pulled in using a deck winch to close the net and prevent encircled fish from escaping (lines 26-29).\n7. The net should be hauled back onto the larger boat as quickly as possible to minimize unwanted mortality (line 31).\n8. All fish and other debris wedged in the net should be removed prior to travelling over the power block (line 34).\n9. Fish remain in the money bag and are sorted by hand (line 36).\n10. NORs not taken for broodstock and non-target fish are immediately returned to the river (lines 38-39).\n11. HORs and other target fish are harvested up to their respective harvest allocations (line 40).\n\nThere's no explicit code in the text, but here's a pseudo-code representation of some steps involved in the purse seine fishing method:\n\n```python\n# Determine fishing area parameters (net length, net depth, mesh size)\nnet_length = determine_net_length()\nnet_depth = determine_net_depth()\nmesh_size = determine_mesh_size()\n\n# Set up net with chafing gear if necessary\nif contact_with_bottom_substrate:\n    chafing_gear = setup_chafing_gear(net_length, mesh_size)\n\n# Deploy net and start set\ndeploy_net()\nstart_set()\n\n# Monitor net for desired duration\nmonitor_net()\n\n# Signal to close the net\nclose_net()\n\n# Affix net to larger vessel and retrieve tow line\naffix_net_to_vessel()\nretrieve_tow_line()\n\n# Retract purse line using deck winch\nretract_purse_line()\n\n# Haul net back onto larger vessel and stack for next set\nhaul_net_back_onto_vessel()\nstack_net()\n\n# Sort fish by hand and return non-targets to the river\nsort_fish()\nreturn_non_targets_to_river()\n\n# Harvest target fish up to their respective allocations\nharvest_target_fish()\n```"
