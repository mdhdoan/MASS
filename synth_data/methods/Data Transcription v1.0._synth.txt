2. Abstract: The Watershed Division of the Nez Perce Tribe uses specific methods to minimize or eliminate errors when converting monitoring data from paper field forms to digital format. This is necessary to ensure accurate and reliable data collection, which is crucial for their environmental studies and decision-making processes. By utilizing these methods, they can maintain data integrity throughout the conversion process.

3. Description: The text outlines the measures taken by the Watershed Division of the Nez Perce Tribe to minimize or eliminate errors when transferring monitoring data from paper field forms to digital format. While most of the data is collected electronically, a small portion is still recorded on paper forms. To convert this data without introducing transcription or transposition errors, several methods are employed:

- Data collection primarily occurs in an electronic format, reducing the need for manual data entry and potential errors.
- Occasionally, some data is gathered using paper field forms, which must be manually transcribed into digital formats.
- To minimize errors during the conversion of paper field form data to a digital format, several techniques are used:
  - Creating a list of relevant keywords serves as quick references for the main topics and themes covered in the data, ensuring proper understanding and accurate transcription.
  - Limit the number of manual transcriptions by entering as much data electronically as possible during field surveys.

4. Target: The primary focus is to minimize or eliminate errors when converting monitoring data from paper field forms to digital format.

5. Constraints: Although most data collection occurs in an electronic format, some data is still recorded on paper field forms, requiring manual transcription and introducing potential transcription or transposition errors.
