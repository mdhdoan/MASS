  "abstract": " This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the steps for collecting surface water samples to identify and measure the presence and levels of pesticides. Pesticides encompass a variety of use classes including herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. The importance of monitoring pesticides in surface waters lies in the broad objectives of these studies; some aim to detect specific chemicals while others look for a wide range of compounds. Due to the hydrophobic nature of some pesticides, the amount of suspended solids (TSS) may influence pesticide levels. To account for this potential correlation, TSS sampling is recommended during the same process. Adhering to this procedure ensures effective identification and measurement of pesticides in surface waters, providing valuable information for environmental assessments and regulatory compliance."

  "description": " This Environmental Assessment Program (EAP) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the methods for collecting surface water samples to assess the presence and concentration of pesticides. Pesticides encompass a broad category of chemicals, including herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. The objective of these monitoring projects can vary; some focus on detecting specific pesticide compounds while others aim to identify a wide range.\n\nThe term hydrophobic refers to certain pesticide classes that exhibit strong adsorption properties with Total Suspended Solids (TSS). As a result, TSS measurements are often taken concurrently with pesticide samples for comprehensive analysis. This relationship between TSS and pesticides is essential in understanding the distribution and behavior of these compounds within surface waters.\n\nTo ensure accurate results when conducting these assessments, this procedure should be followed when sampling surface waters for pesticides identification. It's crucial to note that this document does not provide the exact steps or methods for executing the collection process; instead, it offers an explanation of why and when such measurements should be taken, using technical terms from the method.\n\nIn conclusion, this document emphasizes the importance of monitoring pesticides in surface waters through a standardized procedure. By collecting TSS samples alongside pesticide samples, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of these hydrophobic compounds and their interactions with suspended solids within aquatic environments."

  "constraints": " Based on the provided text, here are the constraints applicable to the method for collecting samples to monitor pesticides in surface waters:\n\n1. The procedure is specific to monitoring pesticides in surface waters. (Line 1)\n2. Different objectives may require monitoring for a few specific chemicals or a wide range of compounds. (Lines 3-5)\n3. The term \"pesticide\" encompasses various use classes, including herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. (Line 8)\n4. Hydrophobic compounds may exhibit a relationship between Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and pesticides. (Lines 9-10)\n5. It is recommended to collect TSS samples alongside pesticide samples when studying hydrophobic compounds. (Line 11)\n6. This procedure should be used for sampling surface waters to determine the presence and concentration of pesticides. (Line 13)\n\nThere is no clear indication of any specific constraints in terms of time, location, frequency, or equipment requirements. If more information about these aspects is needed, it would be essential to consult additional resources or contact subject matter experts."
