2. Abstract: This method discusses the importance of using length measurements from specific parts of a fish when intact specimens are unavailable, particularly for comparing spawning fish. Researchers often rely on MEPS, a measurement taken from the mid-eye point to the posterior scale, which is closely related to the hypural plate, a set of modified vertebrae that support the caudal fin rays. This method aims to remove bias caused by eroded tails or other damage in spawning fish, providing a standardized and fair approach for analysis.
3. Description: Researchers often encounter challenges when measuring lengths of spawning or dead fish due to tail erosion from redd excavation or jaw enlargement/damage. Comparisons between male and female spawners or hatchery-spawned females versus carcasses require unbiased methods. By using length measurements based on intact body parts, such as the orbit and hypural plate, researchers can overcome these issues. The hypural plate consists of modified vertebrae supporting the caudal fin rays and originates from the posterior end of the vertebral column. MEPS (mid-eye to posterior scale) is a common term used for this measurement technique, where researchers typically measure to an external feature when the hypural plate isn't visible.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to provide a standardized approach for measuring fish lengths in situations where intact fish are not available, with a focus on eliminating bias in comparisons between different groups of spawning fish.
5. Constraints: This method relies on the availability and accessibility of specific body parts that remain intact despite damage from spawning activities or other factors. In cases where neither the orbit nor hypural plate can be used, alternative methods may be required. The need to measure to an external feature when the hypural plate isn't visible could introduce some variability in measurements.
