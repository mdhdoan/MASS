2. Abstract: This method details the process of classifying substrate into types at specific locations along eleven evenly spaced transects per site. The transects are established using a specified method (ID 3828), and measurements are restricted to one primary channel. This method is an essential follow-up to the Major Transects Method, providing a more detailed analysis of the substrate within the targeted area.
3. Description: The method begins by establishing transects using the guidelines set out in method ID 3828. Once the transects are in place, measurements are taken along each transect to classify the substrate into various types. This process is carried out at eleven evenly spaced points along each transect, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the site. It is important to note that measurements are restricted to one main channel for consistency and accuracy. This method serves as a crucial complement to the Major Transects Method, allowing for a more detailed examination of the substrate within the targeted area.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to classify substrate into types at specific locations along transects within a defined site.
5. Constraints: This method requires the use of method ID 3828 for establishing transects and must be preceded by the Major Transects Method. Measurements are restricted to one main channel, ensuring standardization in the data collection process.
