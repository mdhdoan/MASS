2. Abstract: The text discusses a method for quantifying the percentage of surface substrate with particles smaller than 2mm and between 2-6mm in size at the tails of pools and non-turbulent channel units. This change is made to ensure mutually exclusive categories, avoiding double-counting particles previously included in both <2mm and <6mm ranges.
3. Description: The method for quantifying the percentage of surface substrate with specific particle size distributions at the tails of pools and non-turbulent channel units has been updated. Previously, there was an overlap in the size categories, causing double-counting of particles smaller than 2mm when counting those smaller than 6mm. The new method resolves this by establishing mutually exclusive categories for particle sizes.
4. Target: To accurately quantify surface substrate particle size distribution at specific locations in water bodies.
5. Constraints: Ensuring that the defined particle size ranges are mutually exclusive and do not overlap, thus avoiding double-counting of particles.
