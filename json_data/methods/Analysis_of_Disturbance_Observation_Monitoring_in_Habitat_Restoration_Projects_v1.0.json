  "abstractText": "Disturbance within restoration project areas can take many forms such as the following human-related disturbances: livestock use, off-road vehicle travel, recreational use, and vandalism of project treatments. Restoration project areas in riparian areas are generally subject to natural disturbances such as scour and deposition, which are desired disturbances supporting natural processes. Disturbance observation monitoring focuses on human-related disturbances, but also includes noting occurrences of extreme natural disturbances that may compromise the success of the restoration project. Visual observation and photo documentation of disturbance effects are important monitoring activities that can inform project maintenance needs and adaptive management requirements.Data collection methods are described in Disturbance Observation Monitoring Method #1186 [https://www.monitoringresources.org/Document/Method/Details/1186].",
