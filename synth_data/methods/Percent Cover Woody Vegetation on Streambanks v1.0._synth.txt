2. Abstract: The necessity of evaluating the effectiveness of bank restoration efforts is addressed through a method that involves measuring canopy cover using streambank transects. This high-level overview describes how this method allows for the assessment of woody vegetation percent cover along a streambank and/or face of the structure at specified distance intervals, which in turn serves to evaluate the establishment of vegetation for long-term natural bank stability and restoration progression towards the desired condition. The information gathered from this method also helps determine potential maintenance needs.
3. Description: This method for assessing canopy cover involves using streambank transects that run parallel to bank restoration structures, including those with live willow cuttings and other live plant materials such as vegetated soil lifts, as well as other treatments that do not incorporate live plant material. Canopy cover is measured by visually assessing the percent cover of woody vegetation along a specified length of streambank and/or face of the structure at set distance intervals. The data collected through this method is used to evaluate the establishment of woody vegetation for long-term natural bank stability, track the progression of restoration cover types towards the desired condition, and identify potential maintenance needs.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to assess the effectiveness of bank restoration efforts by evaluating canopy cover through visual assessment of woody vegetation percent cover along a streambank and/or structure face at specified distance intervals.
5. Constraints: This method requires in-person visual assessment, which may be limited by accessibility, weather conditions, and availability of trained personnel to conduct the assessments. Additionally, the accuracy of the method is dependent on the consistency and skill of the personnel conducting the assessments.
