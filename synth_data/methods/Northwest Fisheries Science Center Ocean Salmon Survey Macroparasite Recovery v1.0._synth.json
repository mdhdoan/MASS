  "abstract": " The method being described is a standard parasitological technique used by the National Fisheries Service Center (NWFSC) to examine juvenile salmon for macroparasites. Macroparasites are large organisms that live inside or on the host animal, and their presence can impact the health and survival of salmon.\n\nThe technique involves carefully examining each salmon for signs of parasitic infestation. This is typically done by visually inspecting the fish's external body surface, internal organs, and sometimes, its digestive tract. The method is necessary as macroparasites can cause harm to the salmon, affecting their growth and survival. By identifying and treating any infections early on, the NWFSC can help maintain a healthy population of salmon.\n\nThe examination process involves several steps: first, the fish are anesthetized to minimize stress and ensure accurate observations. Next, the external body surface is examined for any signs of parasitic infection, such as lesions or discoloration. If necessary, internal organs may be inspected by making a small incision, allowing the examiner to look for signs of infestation. Finally, if there are concerns about intestinal parasites, the fish's digestive tract may be examined via a process called evisceration.\n\nThis technique is crucial in monitoring the health of juvenile salmon populations and maintaining their overall wellbeing. By regularly examining fish for macroparasitic infestations, researchers and fishery managers can take appropriate actions to ensure that these important species remain healthy and thrive in their natural habitats."

  "description": " The provided text describes a standard procedure employed by the National Fisheries Service Center (NWFSC) for examining juvenile salmon for macroparasites during their surveys. This technique, referred to as parasitological examination, is carried out meticulously and systematically to ensure accurate identification and enumeration of any macroparasites present.\n\nThe procedure commences with the collection of live juvenile salmon using appropriate fishing gear or traps. Once captured, the fish are humanely euthanized utilizing approved methods to minimize stress and ensure a swift demise. The fish are then carefully dissected, taking care not to damage internal organs or tissues.\n\nThe dissected fish are subjected to thorough inspection for macroparasites. Macroparasites are large parasitic organisms that can be observed with the naked eye or using low magnification tools like tweezers or forceps. Parasites such as copepods, leeches, and tapeworms are common in salmon and other fish species.\n\nParasites found during examination are carefully extracted using forceps and/or tweezers and preserved for further identification and analysis. Identification is typically based on morphological characteristics such as size, shape, color, and presence of distinguishing features.\n\nThis process is carried out systematically to ensure thoroughness and accuracy. Each fish is examined from multiple angles, paying particular attention to areas known to harbor parasites, such as the gills, eyes, and intestines. In some instances, additional diagnostic tests may be employed to confirm identification or provide more detailed information about the parasite's life cycle stages.\n\nOnce all macroparasites have been identified and enumerated, data is recorded for each fish, including the number, species, and location of any parasites found. This information is essential for understanding the prevalence and distribution of parasites in salmon populations, which can provide valuable insights into overall fish health and potential impacts on population dynamics.\n\nThis comprehensive and standardized approach to macroparasite examination allows the NWFSC to gather accurate and reliable data, enabling them to effectively monitor and manage the health of juvenile salmon populations."
