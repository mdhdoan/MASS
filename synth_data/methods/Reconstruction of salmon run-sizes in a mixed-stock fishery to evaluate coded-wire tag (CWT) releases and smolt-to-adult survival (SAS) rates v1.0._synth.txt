2. Abstract: Run reconstruction is a vital method to understand the fate of salmon in a mixed-stock fishery. Using coded-wire tags, this approach allocates catches to involved stocks and tracks their progression through various fisheries and escapement. By monitoring the percentage of tagged salmon in commercial and sport fisheries, as well as hatcheries and spawning grounds, researchers can assess smolt-to-adult survival rates and program effectiveness. This information helps manage wild and hatchery-produced fish populations, benefiting both the environment and fishing industry.
3. Description: Run reconstruction is a method used to trace the fate of salmon in mixed-stock fisheries by utilizing coded-wire tags (CWT). A proportion of released salmon are implanted with CWTs, which allow for individual identification throughout their lifespan. The primary question addressed by this method is determining the percentage of tagged salmon that return to hatcheries and spawning grounds or are harvested in various fisheries over several years (ages 2 to 6). Data from program releases and recoveries are submitted to the Regional Mark Information System (RMIS), which aggregates CWT information from agencies involved in CWT detection during fisheries sampling, hatchery sampling, spawning ground surveys, and the West Coast data clearinghouse. After allowing sufficient time for data submission, program tag code data are downloaded for analysis, ultimately providing a comprehensive view of salmon fate, including smolt-to-adult survival rates.
4. Target: The primary focus of run reconstruction is to determine the fate of salmon in mixed-stock fisheries and assess smolt-to-adult survival rates, informing management strategies for both wild and hatchery-produced fish populations.
5. Constraints: Run reconstruction relies on accurate and timely data submission from agencies involved in CWT detection. Delays or inconsistencies in data reporting can impact the method's effectiveness and accuracy. Additionally, the success of run reconstruction is dependent on adequate CWT detection rates across all fisheries and hatcheries, ensuring that sufficient data are available for meaningful analysis.
