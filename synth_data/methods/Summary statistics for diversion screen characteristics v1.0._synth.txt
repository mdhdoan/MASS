 1. Keywords: Diversion Screening Projects, NOAAF compliance criteria, screen characteristics, parallel flow, approach velocity.
2. Abstract: The Diversion Screening Projects method involves a survey of specific diversion screen characteristics to evaluate compliance with NOAAF regulations. This information is critical for ensuring safe and efficient water management, as the design and maintenance of these screens can significantly impact aquatic organisms and overall system performance.
3. Description: The text details various characteristics that are evaluated during the Diversion Screening Projects survey, including parallel flow, approach velocity, uniform flow, sweeping velocity vs. approach velocity, sweeping velocity decrease, screen mesh size, circular screens, slotted screens, square screens with specific face opening restrictions, corrosion resistance, gaps, maximum withdrawal, debris accumulation, and clearance. Compliance with these criteria is essential to maintain the safe and effective operation of diversion projects, as they directly impact water flow rates, organism passage, and system longevity.
4. Target: The primary focus of Diversion Screening Projects is evaluating and ensuring compliance with NOAAF regulations for diversion screen design, maintenance, and safety.
5. Constraints: The method has several constraints, such as specific requirements for mesh size, face openings on square screens, corrosion resistance, and clearance, among others. Adherence to these guidelines ensures safe and efficient water management while minimizing impacts on aquatic organisms.
