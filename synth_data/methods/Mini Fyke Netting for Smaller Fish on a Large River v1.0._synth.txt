2. Abstract: The mini fyke net is a unique and effective method for long-term resource monitoring, particularly in lentic habitats and estuarine areas. Its design features, such as the 51mm inner diameter ring, prevent larger predatory fish and turtles from getting through the throat of the net, allowing for sampling of smaller fish species. This method is a valuable alternative when seining is not possible due to obstructions in the habitat. Mini fyke nets are also widely used in fisheries stock assessment due to their low mortality rate and species and size selectivity.
3. Description: The mini fyke net is a useful tool for monitoring long-term changes in fish species abundance in various habitats, especially where seining cannot be used alone or in combination with other methods for a mark-recapture study. With its 51mm inner diameter ring made of stainless steel or nickel-plated material, the net prevents turtles and larger predatory fish from entering while keeping the throat from collapsing. Mini fyke nets are typically suspended between buoyant and weighted lines, similar to gill nets. They are commonly used for sampling smaller fish that inhabit lentic habitats and estuarine areas, which are often difficult to access using other methods due to large and uneven substrate, woody debris, or other obstructions. Mini fyke nets are particularly effective in capturing small, cover-seeking, mobile, and migratory species that follow the shorelines. The nets cause less stress on captured fish compared to entanglement gears, allowing for most of the captured fish to be released unharmed. This method is widely used in fisheries stock assessment because of its low mortality rate and species and size selectivity. Mini fyke nets can also be deployed at wing dams, which are artificial structures that divert flow to the navigation channel and are constructed of rock.
4. Target: The primary focus of the mini fyke net method is long-term resource monitoring and fisheries stock assessment in various aquatic habitats, especially where seining is not feasible.
5. Constraints: The use of mini fyke nets for resource monitoring may be limited by several factors, including the availability of materials, cost, labor requirements, and specific habitat characteristics. Additionally, the effectiveness of the method may be affected by variations in water flow, temperature, and other environmental conditions. Proper placement, maintenance, and retrieval of the nets are also critical to ensure accurate data collection.
