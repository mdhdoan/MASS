2. Abstract: High-density genome-wide DNA sequencing is a powerful tool for discovering genetic markers used in Parentage Based Tagging and Genetic Stock Identification projects. This method can also identify genes under selection, providing valuable insights into the potential for adaptation under climate change. However, whole-genome sequencing of multiple individuals remains cost-prohibitive. A developed approach to overcome this limitation is Pool-Seq, which involves pooling and homogenizing DNA from multiple individuals, significantly reducing costs while still providing a representation of allele frequencies for populations.
3. Description: The text discusses the benefits of high-density genome-wide DNA sequencing in discovering genetic markers for Parentage Based Tagging and Genetic Stock Identification projects. Furthermore, it can identify genes under selection, which is particularly useful for predicting potential adaptation under climate change scenarios. Although reference genomes are increasingly available across broad taxa, whole-genome sequencing of multiple individuals remains expensive. A cost-effective alternative is Pool-Seq, where DNA from multiple individuals is pooled and homogenized, followed by sequencing. This method provides a representation of allele frequencies for populations at a fraction of the cost of individual sequencing. For more information on whole genome resequencing using an individual barcoding method, refer to Method 6754.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a cost-effective alternative to whole-genome sequencing of multiple individuals for Parentage Based Tagging, Genetic Stock Identification projects, and identifying genes under selection.
5. Constraints: Despite the benefits of Pool-Seq, it may not be as accurate as individual sequencing due to potential biases introduced during pooling and homogenization. Additionally, this method may not be suitable for projects requiring high-resolution genotype data or rare variant detection.
