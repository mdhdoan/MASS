  "abstractText": "This method outlines a method of passive angling for collecting fish with baitedset lines. There is no standard setup for gear and size (set line and hook) will vary depending on the species you are trying to capture, as will the bait and lures used. Some species are most effectively collected with stationary gears (for example, channel catfish).The advantage of baited set lines is they can selectively target some species, such as catfish, more so than other species where minimizing the catch of incidental species is desired.",
