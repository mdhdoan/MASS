 1. Keywords: bank stability assessments, percent stability, Method 69, Bank Stability v1.0, classified/categorical data.

2. Abstract: The text presents a method to quantify bank stability assessments by converting them into percent stability scores. This conversion is crucial for understanding and comparing the stability of different banks. Method 69: Bank Stability v1.0 is recommended for collecting relevant data, ensuring standardization and accuracy in the assessment process.

3. Description: The text discusses a method aimed at converting classified/categorical bank stability assessments into percent stability scores. This approach allows for a more precise comparison of bank stability across various institutions. To facilitate this process, Method 69: Bank Stability v1.0 is recommended for data collection. This standardized method ensures consistent evaluation and measurement of bank stability, making it easier to understand and compare results.

4. Target: The primary goal of the method described is to transform categorical bank stability assessments into percent stability scores, allowing for more accurate comparisons between banks.

5. Constraints: There are no explicit constraints mentioned in the text; however, the use of Method 69: Bank Stability v1.0 for data collection is emphasized, suggesting that adhering to this method may be important for obtaining accurate and comparable results.
