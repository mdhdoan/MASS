2. Abstract:
The Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model is a powerful open population method for estimating the apparent survival and detection probabilities of groups of organisms, in this case fish, using data from capture-recapture events. By marking and releasing fish during initial sampling, researchers can use the resulting encounter histories to estimate marked fish survival and capture probabilities as the fish are recaptured in subsequent events. The CJS model helps ecologists monitor populations and make informed management decisions by providing insights into the dynamics of natural systems.

3. Description:
The Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model is a type of open population model used to analyze capture-recapture data for estimating survival and detection probabilities of fish or other organisms. During an initial sampling event, fish are captured, enumerated, marked with unique identifiers, and released back into the environment. In subsequent events, both marked and unmarked individuals are recaptured, providing information about marked fish survival and capture probabilities.

The CJS model uses encounter histories—records of whether an individual is detected (encountered) or not during each sampling event—to isolate the apparent survival and detection probabilities for groups of fish from return rates. By modeling these probabilities, researchers can understand how environmental factors or management strategies impact population dynamics.

4. Target:
The primary focus of the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model is to estimate the apparent survival and detection probabilities in open populations using capture-recapture data.

5. Constraints:
The CJS model relies on certain assumptions, such as:
   * Marks do not affect fish survival or detectability.
   * Fish migrate randomly between sampling events.
   * There is no tag loss or failure.
   * The population is closed during each sampling event.
Violation of these assumptions may lead to biased estimates and should be carefully considered when applying the CJS model.
