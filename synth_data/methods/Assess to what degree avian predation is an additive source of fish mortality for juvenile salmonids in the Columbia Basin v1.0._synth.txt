2. Abstract:
This study investigates the impact of avian predation on the survival rate of smolts in the Snake and Upper Columbia rivers. The research aims to determine whether reductions in avian predation can enhance smolt survival, and if so, to what extent. To achieve this goal, the study will assess the magnitude and variation of predation rates across different spatial-temporal scales. Predation by multiple avian species, including Caspian terns, double-crested cormorants, California gulls, and ring-billed gulls, will be evaluated using cumulative predation rate and survival rate estimates. The study's findings will contribute to our understanding of the relationship between avian predation and smolt survival, as well as the implications for fish population management.

3. Description:
The given text discusses a research method aimed at investigating the impact of avian predation on smolt survival in the Snake and Upper Columbia rivers. The primary goal is to determine whether reductions in avian predation can enhance smolt survival, and if so, to what degree. To achieve this goal, the study will estimate cumulative predation rates and survival rates for large groups of PIT-tagged smolts originating from the two rivers.

The research methodology involves assessing predation by multiple avian species, including Caspian terns, double-crested cormorants, California gulls, and ring-billed gulls, across different spatial and temporal scales. The study will use PIT-tagged smolts to estimate survival rates and compare these estimates with predation rates.

The methods of Evans et al. (2019) will be used to assess the strength and magnitude of the relationship between predation rates and survival rates, including survival to adulthood based on the proportion of PIT-tagged smolts that return to Bonneville Dam as adults. Assessments will include the relative contribution of avian predation rates on smolt survival across multiple spatial scales, including local (e.g., reservoir), regional (e.g., hydrosystem), and life-cycle (e.g., adult returns) scales.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the method is to determine whether reductions in avian predation can enhance smolt survival, and if so, to what degree.

5. Constraints:
One potential constraint for this research method could be the availability and accuracy of PIT-tagging data for smolts. The study relies on PIT-tagged smolts to estimate survival rates, so any issues with tag retention or migration could impact the accuracy of these estimates. Additionally, the study's findings may be limited by the specific spatial-temporal scales evaluated and the avian species included in the assessment.
