2. Abstract: The Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission's fish genetics lab in Hagerman, ID has been developing and testing genetic markers for conserving and managing fish populations in the Columbia River basin. These markers have been used for various projects involving GSI, PBT, hybridization studies, reproductive success, and selection studies. A specific set of 192 SNP markers has been selected for use by CRITFC and IDFG for BPA projects involving GSI and PBT in the Columbia River basin. The methods and procedures for running these SNPs on the Fluidigm EP1 SNP Genotyping platform are detailed in method 1332.
3. Description: The text discusses the development, testing, and application of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic markers by the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission's fish genetics lab in Hagerman, ID for the conservation and management of fish populations in the Columbia River basin. The lab has tested hundreds of SNP genetic markers developed by labs throughout the PNW for their possible conservation and management applications. Additionally, they have developed and tested hundreds of SNP loci specifically for projects involving GSI, PBT, intraspecific hybridization/introgression, reproductive success, and selection studies. The text then focuses on the use of a specific set of 192 SNP markers (two 96 panel sets) for both steelhead and Chinook salmon that have been selected for use by CRITFC and IDFG for BPA projects involving GSI and PBT in the Columbia River basin. The procedures for running these SNPs on the Fluidigm EP1 SNP Genotyping platform are described in method 1332, with primer/probe sequences and assay plate configurations included in the attachment (Columbia River Basin OMY and OTS SNP sets 2apr12.pdf). The text concludes by mentioning that for PBT broodstock tagging in the Snake River basin, one 96 SNP panel for each species has been optimized to provide sufficient power for parentage tagging and both the 96 PBT SNP panel and a second 96 SNP panel are run for GSI projects.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is on the development, testing, and application of SNP genetic markers for conserving and managing fish populations in the Columbia River basin through various projects involving GSI, PBT, intraspecific hybridization/introgression, reproductive success, and selection studies.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need for specialized lab equipment such as the Fluidigm EP1 SNP Genotyping platform, trained personnel to perform the genetic testing, and access to the necessary funding and resources to support the ongoing development and application of these genetic markers in fish conservation and management efforts.
