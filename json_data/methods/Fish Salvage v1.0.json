  "abstractText": "The Walla Walla River is heavily diverted for irrigation of agricultural crops. Passage constraints associated with these diversions and dewatered stream reaches are one of the major factors limiting fisheries restoration efforts in the basin. Low river flows and diversion structures can delay or preclude the migration of both adult and juvenile salmonids.Each year, often near the start or end of the irrigation season, CTUIR, ODFW, WDFW, and irrigation districts cooperate in salvaging fish from perilous passage conditions in the Walla Walla River.at various sites as needed. When asked by the Fish Passage Project and/or irrigation district operators, the Walla Walla Salmonid Monitoring and Evaluation (WWSM&E) project performs fish salvages at various diversion dams, irrigation canals, and hatchery intakes. Typically, each site has an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) crew that is responsible for drawing downwater levels through the manipulation of weirs. The WWSM&E project relies on the expertise of site-specific O&M crews to lower flows to a wadeable level in preparation of fish salvageoperations.Duringfish salvage efforts, seines and/or backpack electrofishing gear are used to capturefish. Upon capture, fish are placed in aerated buckets filled with cool water. Each individual fishis identified to species and recorded on a data sheet. Although species tallies are a quantitative metric, the primary goal of our fish salvage operations isnon-quantitative. The primary goal is to remove fish from perilous passage conditions and return them uninjured to nearby free flowing areas of the river.However, quantitative species counts are used forEndangered Species Act Take reporting and indices of species presence/absence.",
