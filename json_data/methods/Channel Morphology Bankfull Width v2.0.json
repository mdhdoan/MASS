  "abstractText": "Bankfullwidth will be measured at each major transect using the compass and laser. Refer to the full AREMP protocol (attached) for instructions on calibration and setup of the compass and laser.There must be well-defined bankfull indicators present to sufficiently establish survey transects throughout the length of the site, signifying that it is an active channel. An active channel will have some combination of the following bankfull indicators:i. Examine stream banks for an active floodplain. This is a relatively flat, depositional area that is commonly vegetated and above the bankfull elevation.ii. Examine depositional features such as point bars. The highest elevation of a point bar usually indicates the lowest possible elevation for bankfull stage. However, depositional features can form both above and below the bankfull elevation when unusual flows occur during years preceding the survey. Large floods can form bars that extend above bankfull whereas several years of low flows can result in bars forming below bankfull elevation.iii. A break in slope of the banks and/or change in the particle size distribution from coarser bed load particles to finer particles deposited during bank overflow conditions.iv. Locate the elevation where mature key riparian woody vegetation exists. The lowest elevation of birch, alder, and dogwood can be useful, whereas willows are often found below the bankfull elevation.v. Examine the ceiling of undercut banks. This elevation is usually slightly below the bankfull elevation.vi. Stream channels actively reform bankfull features such as floodplains after shifts or down cutting in the channel. Be careful not to confuse old floodplains and terraces with the present indicators.",
