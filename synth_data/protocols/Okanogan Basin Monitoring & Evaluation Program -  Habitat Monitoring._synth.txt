 1. Abstract: OBMEP is a long-term monitoring program focused on the status and trends of salmonid habitat conditions in their freshwater life stages. It uses the GRTS approach to select sites and follows rigorous protocols for data collection and analysis, coordinating with multiple agencies and projects for compatibility.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: The value of OBMEP is in monitoring and protecting salmonid habitats to ensure their survival and maintain biodiversity. The problem statement is the need to address declining salmonid populations due to habitat degradation. The desired outcome is to have scientifically sound data on habitat, water quality, and biota over time to inform conservation efforts.
3. Description: OBMEP uses the GRTS approach for site selection and follows monitoring protocols from CSMEP, PNAMP, and EMAP. It collects data on physical habitat conditions for salmonids below anadromous barriers, ensuring compatibility with other regional and basin-wide projects. The program's methods, metrics, and indicators are aligned with these organizations' standards to ensure high-quality data collection and analysis.
4. Objectives: The objective is to monitor the status and change of physical habitat for salmonids below anadromous barriers in a scientifically rigorous manner. This objective covers the entire problem statement by providing data on habitat, water quality, and biota over time to inform conservation efforts. Keywords include GRTS approach, CSMEP, PNAMP, EMAP, salmonid habitats, and anadromous barriers.
5. Target: The primary focus of OBMEP is monitoring the status and trends of salmonid habitat conditions in their freshwater life stages.
6. Constraints: The constraints for OBMEP include coordinating with multiple agencies and projects, ensuring compatibility with other regional and basin-wide efforts, and following rigorous protocols for data collection and analysis.
