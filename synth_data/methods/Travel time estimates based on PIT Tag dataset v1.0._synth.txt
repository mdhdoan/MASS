2. Abstract: This method presents a way to calculate the mean travel times for a population of PIT-tagged fish using data from DART and PTAGIS. It offers both arithmetic and harmonic mean estimates to provide a comprehensive view of the group's speed. The harmonic mean is particularly useful in this context as it is more robust against outliers, which can occur when dealing with rates of speed such as fish travel times.
3. Description: The method for calculating the mean travel times for PIT-tagged fish involves processing data uploaded to DART from PTAGIS. Two types of estimates are provided: arithmetic and harmonic means. The arithmetic mean is a common measure of central tendency, while the harmonic mean is more robust against outliers in rates of speed. This makes it particularly useful when dealing with travel times for fish populations. A harmonic mean is typically used to calculate the average rate of speed over a set distance. In this case, the primary interest is the speed at which fish travel from point A to point B.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of the method is to accurately estimate the mean travel times for a population of PIT-tagged fish, with an emphasis on the harmonic mean as a more robust measure in the presence of outliers.
5. Constraints: One constraint of this method is the availability and accuracy of data from PTAGIS and DART. Additionally, the use of the harmonic mean may not be appropriate in all cases, such as when there are very few observations or when the distribution of travel times is highly skewed.
