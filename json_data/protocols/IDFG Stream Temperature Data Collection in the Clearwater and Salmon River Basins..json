  "background": "Stream temperature data are collected in drainagewhere fish-in/fish-out monitoring of wild steelhead is performed. Additionalstreams are also sampled that span a range of elevation, geomorphic, and vegetative cover across steelhead natal streams. Abundance and life history of steelhead are influenced by the basic productivity, habitat, and thermal regime of the rearing stream. Thus, data can be analyzed and available for use as environmental co-variates for steelhead effectiveness evaluations and for general environmental status and trends monitoring.",
