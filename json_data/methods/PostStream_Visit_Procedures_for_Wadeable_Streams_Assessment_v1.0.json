  "abstractText": "Upon reaching a lodging location after sampling a stream, the team reviews all completed data forms and sample labels for accuracy, completeness, and legibility, and makes a final inspection of samples. If information is missing from the forms or labels, the team leader should fill in the missing information as accurately as possible. The team leader initials all data forms after review. The other team member should inspect and clean sampling equipment, check the inventory of supplies, and prepare samples for shipment. Other activities include shipping samples, submitting sampling status and tracking information to Tetra Tech, and communicating with the field coordinator or other central contact person.",
