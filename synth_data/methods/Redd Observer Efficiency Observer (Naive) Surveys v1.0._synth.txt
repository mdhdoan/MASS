2. Abstract: This method describes the procedures for conducting naive observer redd surveys to examine redd detection efficiency. Naive observer surveys involve observers with no prior knowledge of redd counts or locations. The importance of this method lies in its ability to identify and quantify errors associated with redd counts, which are used to monitor salmonid populations. These errors can result from various factors such as the timing of counts, redd characteristics, spawning habitat characteristics, spawner densities, and surveyor experience. By identifying these sources of error, managers and conservationists can better understand and mitigate their impacts on the accuracy of redd count data, ultimately leading to improved management and conservation of salmonid species.

3. Description: Naive observer redd surveys are a crucial tool for monitoring salmonid populations by detecting and counting redds (nests). The primary assumption of redd counts is that they represent the actual number of redds. However, numerous factors can affect the detectability of redds, leading to errors in redd count data. These sources of error include the timing of counts, redd characteristics, spawning habitat characteristics, spawner densities, and surveyor experience. This method aims to identify and quantify these sources of error by conducting naive observer surveys, where observers have no prior knowledge of redd counts or locations. By comparing the results of multiple surveys conducted under varying conditions, this method can provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of redd count data, ultimately informing the management and conservation of salmonid species.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to examine redd detection efficiency by conducting naive observer surveys in order to identify and quantify sources of error in redd counts.

5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include limitations in resources, such as time, personnel, and funding, which may affect the frequency and extent of surveys conducted. Additionally, environmental conditions, such as water depth and clarity, can impact surveyor ability to detect redds, potentially limiting the accuracy of data collected. Finally, variable spawn timing among different salmonid species may require tailored approaches for optimal detection of redds, further complicating survey efforts.
