2. Abstract: This method outlines a comprehensive plan for monitoring water quality in a watershed. It utilizes specific indicators such as maximum daily maximum temperature, maximum weekly maximum temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus to assess the health of the water body. The plan describes standard procedures for data collection, equipment calibration, and data analysis, ensuring accurate and reliable results. This method aims to provide a scientific basis for land management activities and inform decision-making related to water quality conservation.
3. Description: The method includes two temperature metrics, maximum daily maximum temperature (MDMT) and maximum weekly maximum temperature (MWMT), as specific indicators of water temperature. Data loggers are used to measure these temperatures, following pre-placement, placement, and retrieval procedures outlined in Zaroban (2000). The plan also includes turbidity as a sediment-related indicator under water quality, measured using monitoring instruments calibrated on the nephelometric turbidity method. Daily means, standard deviations, and maximum turbidities should be calculated. OPSW (1999) provides a standardized method for measuring turbidity and guidelines for data quality. The plan also includes five specific indicators associated with contaminants and nutrients: conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrogen, and phosphorus. Standard methods for measurements, data quality guidelines, equipment, field-measurement procedures, and methods to store and analyze water quality data are outlined in OPSW (1999).
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to establish a systematic approach for monitoring water quality in a watershed through the use of specific indicators and standardized measurement procedures.
5. Constraints: The success of this method depends on access to appropriate equipment, calibration tools, and trained personnel to carry out data collection and analysis. Additionally, the accuracy and reliability of results may be affected by environmental factors such as weather conditions, water flow rates, and sediment loads.
