  "abstractText": "Conduct aerial reconnaissance surveys throughout the Columbia River basin to monitor known colonial waterbird colony sites, as well as identify incipient or new breeding colonies of piscivorous waterbirds. Aerial reconnaissance surveys are conducted from a manned, fixed-wing aircraft to determine the distribution of piscivorous waterbirds (both nesting and loafing) on the Columbia River from the estuary to Chief Joseph Dam and on the lower Snake River from the Columbia River confluence to Lower Granite Dam, as well as at colony sites off the mid-Columbia and lower Snake rivers but within tern foraging range (~90 km). Reconnaissance aerial surveys are conducted early in the breeding season (April-May) to check for the formation of established colonies or incipient colonies.When piscivorous colonial waterbirds are observed on the ground on substrate that is considered suitable for nesting, oblique aerial photography is taken using a digital SLR camera with an image-stabilizing, zoom lens. When in-flight observations or post-flight inspection of digital images suggested the presence of a potential breeding colony, carefully timed ground- or boat-based surveys are conducted to assess the breeding status and nesting chronology at the site.The end product is a list of sites surveyed and their GPS coordinates and the behavior of the birds at the site (i.e. nesting [nests or chicks] or loafing). All active colonies are then plotted on a map of the study area.",
