  "description": "<p>CHaMP&nbsp;is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010).&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;salmonids&nbsp;and/or their habitat. The implementation of&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;56.3,&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;57, and&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;3.&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel (see section 1.6), at least 9 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lemhi&rsquo;s&nbsp;primary objective was to estimate habitat condition for the&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;subbasin, and estimate the habitat condition in the&nbsp;priority&nbsp;drainages&nbsp;(see strata list). The&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;status and trends sampling design consisted of 45 unique sites sampled over three years (the standard&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;design) and was supplemented with 72 sites funded by the&nbsp;ISEMP&nbsp;program until 2013.&nbsp; The Steelhead (Snake River Basin&nbsp;DPS) -&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;River and &nbsp;the Chinook Salmon (Snake River Spring/Summer-run&nbsp;ESU) -&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;River were the populations of interest. &nbsp;The original rationale was to allocate annual sites across the smaller tributaries to get a broad coverage of the diversity of habitat types, and use more rotating panel sites in the larger tributaries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, habitat restoration efforts planned for the&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;River include the removal of barriers on Lee and Pratt Creeks, enabling year-around access for&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;fish and opening the&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;target frame to these areas. &nbsp;This design is a supplemental&nbsp;GRTS&nbsp;draw for the&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;2011-2013&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;design within the&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;area of Pratt&nbsp;Creek. &nbsp;One site in each of 3 rotating panels will be drawn using&nbsp;GRTS. &nbsp;An Extra panel will include the&nbsp;oversample&nbsp;sites available for all panels due to the small target frame and limited number of master sample sites.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2015</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, there were no updates to the Pratt design. &nbsp;The Lemhi Status and Trend design (ID 420) was updated to accommodate 10% repeat sampling in 2015, but the Pratt Creek stratum was not impacted. &nbsp;After the field season, the design was updated to move site 519007 from the Extra block to RP 2 to replace 407391 (rejected site).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
