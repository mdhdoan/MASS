2. Abstract: This protocol aims to estimate the loss of juvenile fall Chinook salmon to smallmouth bass predation in the Hells Canyon reach of the Snake River. The motivation for this study arises from the need to understand the impact of smallmouth bass on the survival of subyearling fall Chinook salmon, which are critical to meeting recovery goals outlined in the 2008 Biological Opinion (RPA 55). This protocol will address potential biases between different predator collection methods and ensure accurate abundance estimation through mark-recapture methods.
3. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: The value of this study lies in its contribution to understanding the factors affecting Snake River Fall Chinook Salmon recovery. The problem statement is the need to determine the impact of smallmouth bass predation on juvenile fall Chinook salmon in the Hells Canyon reach. The desired outcome is an accurate estimation of juvenile fall Chinook salmon loss due to smallmouth bass predation, which can inform management strategies and contribute to recovery goals.
4. Description: This protocol (Project 199102900) focuses on estimating the loss of juvenile fall Chinook salmon to smallmouth bass predation in the Hells Canyon reach of the Snake River. The study will utilize mark-recapture methods to ensure accurate abundance estimation and address potential biases between different predator collection methods. This detailed, technical approach aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of smallmouth bass on juvenile fall Chinook salmon in the target area.
5. Objectives: The main objective is to accurately estimate the loss of juvenile fall Chinook salmon to smallmouth bass predation in the Hells Canyon reach, addressing potential biases between different collection methods and ensuring sufficient samples for statistical analysis. This objective covers the entire problem statement outlined in the abstract. Keywords include: Project 199102900, mark-recapture methods, bias reduction, and accurate abundance estimation.
6. Target: The primary focus is estimating juvenile fall Chinook salmon loss due to smallmouth bass predation in the Hells Canyon reach of the Snake River.
7. Constraints: Potential constraints for this protocol include limited access to suitable sampling locations, variability in environmental conditions affecting fish behavior, and potential limitations in mark-recapture method applicability.
