2. Abstract: This method details the process of extracting DNA from environmental DNA (eDNA) samples using a room temperature preservation technique and a phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol DNA extraction approach. The method was modified by Kim Parsons, building on the work of Renshaw et al. (2015), providing a valuable tool for eDNA-based research and monitoring.
3. Description: The text describes a method for extracting DNA from filtered eDNA samples, utilizing a phenol-chloroform approach adapted by Kim Parsons from the work of Renshaw et al. (2015). The source method involves the preservation of eDNA samples at room temperature and their integration into a phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol DNA extraction process. This technique offers an efficient solution for isolating high-quality DNA from environmental samples, enabling further genetic analysis.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a reliable and efficient approach for extracting DNA from filtered eDNA samples using a phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction technique.
5. Constraints: Some constraints for the current method might include potential limitations in scalability for large sample sets, potential hazards associated with handling phenol-chloroform, and the need for specific equipment and trained personnel to carry out the procedure effectively.
