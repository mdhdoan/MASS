 1. Keywords: Terrestrial macroinvertebrates, collection procedures, taxonomic identification, isotope analysis, stream/lake edges.

2. Abstract: This document outlines the standard operating procedures for collecting terrestrial macroinvertebrates along the edges of streams and lakes. The purpose of this method is to ensure consistent, reliable, and reproducible collection techniques that enable accurate taxonomic identification and isotope analysis. These procedures are crucial for studying aquatic ecosystems, monitoring water quality, and understanding biodiversity patterns in freshwater environments.

3. Description: The method begins by detailing the necessary materials and equipment for collecting macroinvertebrates, including nets, forceps, containers, and field guides. Next, it describes specific techniques to collect samples from various substrates (e.g., rocks, sediment, vegetation) along the stream or lake edges, ensuring that proper care is taken to preserve organisms for later identification and analysis. The document also provides guidance on sorting and preserving collected specimens for taxonomic examination in a laboratory setting. Finally, it addresses sampling strategies for isotope analysis, including the recommended number of samples required and best practices for processing and interpretation.

4. Target: This method aims to provide standardized collection procedures for terrestrial macroinvertebrates, focusing on the requirements for accurate taxonomic identification and isotope analysis.

5. Constraints: Some constraints for this method include potential limitations in accessing suitable water bodies, restrictions due to weather conditions or seasonality, and the need for specialized equipment and trained personnel to ensure proper sampling techniques and correct identification of organisms.
