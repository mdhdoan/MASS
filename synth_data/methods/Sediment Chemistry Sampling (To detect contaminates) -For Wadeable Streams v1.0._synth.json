  "abstract": " In order to assess the water quality of a specific stream site, this method outlines a process for collecting a composite sediment sample. During data collection events (DCEs), which typically last an entire day, three separate shallow-water stations are chosen within the site for sampling. By combining scoops from these different locations, a more representative and accurate sample of the overall site is obtained.\n\nThis approach is essential to effectively detect potential contaminants like metals (copper, lead, zinc, arsenic) and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Analyzing these compounds in a composite sample allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the presence and levels of pollutants at the site.\n\nAdditionally, other analyses are performed on the sample to aid in interpreting the results. These include measuring the total organic carbon content and grain size composition. This information provides context and helps assess the environmental impact of any detected contaminants."

  "description": " In this meticulously crafted procedure, we delve into the intricacies of collecting a site-composite sediment sample at stream sites during day-long data collection events (DCEs). The composite sample is amassed by gathering scoops from three distinctly located shallow-water stations within the site.\n\nThe significance of this procedure lies in its capacity to identify the presence of specific contaminants residing at the site. To accomplish this, an elaborate analysis ensues. The sample undergoes examination for a suite of metals, including copper (Cu), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), and arsenic (As). Additionally, a standard assortment of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds is scrutinized.\n\nTo facilitate proper interpretation of the outcomes, the sample is further analyzed for its total organic carbon (TOC) content and grain size composition. The determination of TOC offers valuable insights into the sediment's organic matter content, while the assessment of grain size distribution provides essential information regarding the sediment's texture and provenance."
