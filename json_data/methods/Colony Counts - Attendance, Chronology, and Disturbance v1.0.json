  "abstractText": "Counts of Caspian terns, double-crested cormorants and other piscivorous colonial waterbirds (e.g., Brandts cormorants) are used to assess colony attendance, nesting chronology (key behavioral or life history events), and colony disturbance on East Sand Island in the Columbia River estuary.  Data is collected from observations blinds within plots/zones that are set up throughout the bird colony.  Results are used to identify factors that limit nesting and/or to evaluate the efficacy of avian management initiatives aimed at reducing colony size.",
