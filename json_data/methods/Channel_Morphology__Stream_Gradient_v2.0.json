  "abstractText": "The stream gradient is measured by the change in elevation measured between the left wetted at Transect A and the left wetted at Transect K (or their respective thalwegs if the reach is dry at either Transect A or K; fig 6) divided by the reach length. Since the reach length is already known, this section discusses how to measure the change in elevation between A and K.",
