2. Abstract: This method describes the process of collecting and analyzing data for Riparian Planting Projects. Field data is uploaded into an MS Access database, which computes summary statistics on habitat conditions at the reach scale. These summary statistics were selected based on their high signal-to-noise ratios. Specific variables reported include GPS coordinates, reach length, width, area planted, riparian vegetation structure, canopy density, bank erosion, tail fines, number of plantings, percent of plants living, and percent cover of woody vegetation within the riparian planting area. Statistical significance will be tested using a paired-t test for the number of riparian plantings, canopy cover, and riparian vegetation structure.
3. Description: After collecting field data for Riparian Planting Projects, the data is uploaded into an MS Access database. The database then calculates summary statistics that reflect habitat conditions at the reach scale. These summary statistics were primarily developed as part of the EPA's EMAP and selected due to their high signal-to-noise ratios compared to other potential variables. The following variables are reported: GPS coordinates, sample date, reach length, reach width, area planted, riparian vegetation structure, canopy density, bank erosion, average pool tail fines, number of plantings, percent of plants living, and percent cover of woody vegetation within the riparian planting area. Statistical significance will be tested using a paired-t test for the number of riparian plantings, canopy cover, and riparian vegetation structure.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to analyze and interpret data collected from Riparian Planting Projects to reflect habitat conditions at the reach scale.
5. Constraints: One possible constraint for this method could be the accuracy and reliability of the field data collection process, as well as the potential limitations of the MS Access database in calculating summary statistics. Additionally, the paired-t test used to determine statistical significance may have its own constraints, such as the assumption of normality or equal variances.
