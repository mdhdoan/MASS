 1. Keywords: fish data analysis, paired trawl and gill net samples, correction factor, midwater trawl gear
2. Abstract: The text outlines a method for analyzing fish data collected from paired trawl and gillnet samples. This analysis will help in building a correction factor for midwater trawl gear, addressing the need for accurate representation of catch data in different fishing methods.
3. Description: The text describes a method aimed at analyzing fish data gathered through paired trawl and gill net sampling techniques. By comparing the data from both types of equipment, the method seeks to establish a correction factor for midwater trawl gear. This factor will allow researchers to better understand the true catch rates in this type of fishing, addressing any discrepancies between the two sampling methods.
4. Target: Developing a correction factor for midwater trawl gear
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method would depend on factors such as data quality, availability and consistency, and the accuracy of both trawl and gill net sampling techniques. Additional constraints may include environmental conditions and variations in fish behavior that could impact the comparability of the data.
