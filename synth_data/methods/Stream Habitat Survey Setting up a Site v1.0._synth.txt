2. Abstract: A long-term monitoring program has been established to assess and track the current conditions and trends of salmon habitats over time. This program utilizes a combination of stream habitat surveys, juvenile snorkeling inventories, and spawning salmon surveys, with sampling points randomly selected using GIS. The methods for this monitoring effort are based on basin surveys conducted since 1990 but have been modified to better suit the specific needs of long-term tracking.
3. Description: The long-term monitoring program consists of three main components: stream habitat surveys, juvenile snorkeling inventories, and spawning salmon surveys. These methods are similar to those used in basin surveys conducted by the ODFW Aquatic Inventories Project since 1990, but have been modified for this specific monitoring effort. Habitat survey measurements are taken at increased frequency, while other measurements are omitted due to the standardized survey length of the monitoring sites. These modifications are specific to the monitoring surveys and do not apply to comprehensive basin surveys. The sampling points used in these surveys are randomly selected using GIS.
4. Target: To determine and track current salmon habitat conditions over time.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the standardized survey length of the monitoring sites, which necessitates increased frequency of certain measurements and omission of others. These modifications are specific to the monitoring surveys and do not apply to comprehensive basin surveys.
