  "background": "The White Sturgeon population of Lake Roosevelt has documented recruitment failure since the early 1990s (Hildebrand et al. 1999; DeVore et al. 2000). The UCWSRI (Upper Columbia White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative) which was established for the continued conservation of White Sturgeon in the Transboundary Reach, decided thata conservation aquaculture program was needed in order to account for this loss of recruitment. Annual conservation aquaculture operationsutilize wild caught larvae as a source of progeny in order to preserve the remaining genetic diversity. These wild caught larvae harbor greater genetic diversity than hatchery broodstock progeny (Schreier and May 2012) and therefore it was decided to pursue wild caught larvae over the previously used broodstock for aquaculture sources.Larval collection efforts for the conservation aquaculture program are conducted just above the China Bend boat launch during the months of June and July. White Sturgeon larval monitoring is conducted to detect a peak in larval numbers. After a peak in numbersis detected, the collectionphasebegins a week later. Sampling is conducted throughout the spawning period in order to increase the genetic diversity represented by the aquaculture program.",
