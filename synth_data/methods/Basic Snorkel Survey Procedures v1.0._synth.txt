 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are five relevant keywords related to the snorkeling method described in the text body:

1. Snorkeling
2. Fish surveys
3. Salmonids
4. Non-disruptive sampling
5. Habitat use assessment

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
Snorkeling is a non-disruptive and cost-effective method used for underwater observation and study of fish populations in flowing waters. The method involves using snorkel surveys to monitor fish abundance, distribution, presence/absence, species assemblages, stock characteristics, and habitat use. Snorkeling is particularly useful for surveying salmonids due to their territorial nature and preference for clear water habitats. Compared to other methods such as electrofishing, gillnetting, traps, and nets, snorkeling results in minimal disturbance to the target species and requires less cost outlay. The accuracy of snorkel surveys can be estimated through replication or calibration with other methods, making it a reliable method for fish population assessment.

3. Description:
Snorkeling is a non-invasive sampling method used in underwater observation and study of fish populations in flowing waters. It involves using snorkel surveys to monitor fish abundance, distribution, presence/absence, species assemblages, stock characteristics, and habitat use. Snorkeling is often selected for surveying salmonids due to their territorial nature in freshwater and preference for habitats with high water clarity. The method is particularly useful for remote locations or areas where other methods such as electrofishing, traps, nets, or gillnetting are not feasible due to deep and clear water or low conductivity. Snorkel surveys provide an alternative to traditional and more disruptive methods, allowing for the collection of information on individual or group movement, behavior, and habitat associations. Snorkeling can also be combined with other methods such as sonar and geographic information systems (GIS) to generate three-dimensional maps of habitat use by fish species. The accuracy of snorkel surveys can be estimated through replication or calibration with other methods, making it a reliable method for fish population assessment.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the snorkeling method is to provide a non-disruptive and cost-effective way to assess fish populations in flowing waters.

5. Constraints:
Snorkeling as a method has some constraints that need to be considered, including the need for trained observers, potential observer bias, and limitations in visibility due to water clarity or light levels. Additionally, there may be limitations in the types of species that can be accurately surveyed through snorkeling, particularly those that are not easily visible or tend to stay hidden.
