 1. Keywords: Pathogen sampling, WDFW hatchery practices policies, coordination with lab, tissue and fluid collection, processing samples.
2. Abstract: Pathogen sampling is a crucial requirement under the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's (WDFW) hatchery practices policies. This method ensures that any potential harmful organisms are identified and controlled to maintain healthy fish populations in hatcheries. Proper coordination with laboratories processing the samples, following their specific protocols for tissue and fluid collection, is essential for accurate results and effective pathogen management.
3. Description: Pathogen sampling, as outlined by WDFW hatchery practices policies, involves a series of steps aimed at identifying and managing harmful organisms in fish populations. The process requires coordination with the laboratory responsible for processing the samples to ensure proper collection and handling of tissue and fluids. Adhering to specific protocols provided by these labs guarantees accurate results and enables effective control measures to be implemented, ensuring healthy hatchery operations.
4. Target: The primary focus of pathogen sampling is identifying and managing harmful organisms in fish populations within hatcheries under WDFW policies.
5. Constraints: Coordinating with designated laboratories, understanding and following their specific protocols for tissue and fluid collection, and ensuring proper implementation of control measures based on the results of the samples are some constraints of pathogen sampling.
