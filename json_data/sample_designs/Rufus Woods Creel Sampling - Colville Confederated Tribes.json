  "description": "<p>Rufus Woods Lake is a reservoir located on the upper Columbia River between Chief Joseph and Grand Coulee dams (river km 877 and 960 respectively). It supports a robust trout fishery that is currently maintained by stocking efforts of the Colville Tribes Resident Fish Hatchery. The goal of the Rufus Woods Fisheries Evaluation Project (formerly titled &ldquo;Rufus Woods Habitat/Passage Improvement, Creel and Triploid Supplementation&rdquo;) and this creel survey is to provide fisheries managers with information that assists with the development and maintenance of a subsistence fishery for Colville Confederated Tribes tribal members and a quality sport fishery for members and non-members while conserving native species. The CCT utilizes this reservoir wide creel survey to assist with the development of stocking strategies and to inform adaptive management of the fishery.</p>\r\n",
