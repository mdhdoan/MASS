2. Abstract: The method described involves estimating the number of juvenile salmonids migrating downstream during a specific period using a rotary screw trap and an estimate of trap efficiency. Period estimates are combined to provide a seasonal estimation of migrants with associated confidence intervals. Regular trap efficiency tests throughout the migration year ensure accurate and reliable results.
3. Description: The methodology consists of estimating the number of juvenile salmonids migrating downstream during a given period based on rotary screw trap catches and an estimate of trap efficiency (Method ID: 134). To obtain the seasonal abundance, estimates and their corresponding variances from each period are combined. Weekly trap efficiency tests conducted throughout the migration year at the trap site contribute to improved accuracy in estimating migrant abundance. This method provides a reliable and consistent approach for assessing juvenile salmonid populations during migration seasons.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to estimate juvenile salmonid migration abundance accurately using rotary screw traps, trap efficiency calculations, and associated confidence intervals.
5. Constraints: This method's constraints include maintaining accurate and consistent trap efficiency estimates for the given period, ensuring reliable trap performance over time, accounting for potential environmental fluctuations affecting salmonid migration patterns, and incorporating appropriate statistical techniques to calculate confidence intervals.
