  "abstract": " Gillnets are a type of fishing net that is passively left in the water to catch fish. They can be used in various habitats and are effective for both commercial and research fisheries. The size selectivity of gillnets depends on the mesh size, making them highly efficient in capturing specific fish sizes. They come in different materials such as single strand mono-filament or multi-strand nylon, which affects their effectiveness. Diving gillnets are particularly successful at catching large numbers of bottom-dwelling fish like sturgeons.\n\nGiven their passive nature and widespread use, gillnets have several advantages. They are cost-effective due to minimal training requirements and can be standardized across different platforms. Additionally, they offer a high degree of size selectivity without the need for bait or active engagement from fishermen, making them an essential tool in various fisheries."

  "description": " Gillnets are a passive fishing gear utilized extensively in various aquatic habitats for both commercial and research purposes (Hubert, 1996). The primary function of a gillnet is to capture fish by obstructing their gills as they swim through the mesh (Hubert, 1996). The selectivity of gillnets relies on the size of the meshes deployed. Smaller meshes result in smaller catches, while larger meshes target larger species (Hubert, 1996).\n\nGillnets are available in various constructions, with the most common being single strand mono-filament and multi-strand nylon webbing (Hubert, 1996). The material's choice affects the gillnet's efficiency in capturing target fish species. For instance, single strand mono-filament gillnets are known for their high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent flexibility, making them suitable for use in diverse environments (Hubert, 1996). On the other hand, multi-strand nylon gillnets provide better resistance to abrasion when used in areas with rocky or uneven bottoms.\n\nDiving gillnets, a specialized type of this fishing gear, are particularly effective at catching large numbers of bottom-oriented fish species such as sturgeons (Hubert, 1996). These nets can be efficiently deployed and retrieved in relatively short periods, making them an attractive choice for fisheries due to their time and cost efficiency. Additionally, because of the widespread use of gillnets in various applications, training costs are minimal, and standardization across multiple fishing platforms is achievable."
