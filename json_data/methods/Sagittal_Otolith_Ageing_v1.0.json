  "abstractText": "After otoliths are removed from fish (see Method ID 1078), they need some preparation before they are ready to read. The best option to prepare otoliths varies by species, but we have chosen to mount the otoliths in epoxy and section them which is effective for clouded otoliths or otoliths from older fish, such as our focal species. This method describes how we go about preparing otoliths for ageing.",
