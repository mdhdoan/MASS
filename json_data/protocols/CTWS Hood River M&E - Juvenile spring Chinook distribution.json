  "background": "The Hood River Production Program was founded in 1991 to reintroduce spring Chinook and supplement winter and summer steelhead to recover depleted stocks. One of the first projects ODFW and CTWS embarked upon in the early 1990s were fish surveys of the Hood River and its major tributaries to determine a fish community assemblage and gather baseline data on rearing densities of salmonids in the Hood River basin. Methods employed were generally electrofishing depletion techniques. Since these initial surveys the HRPP has been supplementing populations of winter steelhead, summer steelhead, and spring Chinook for nearly 20 years and over several complete generations of adult returns. Various monitoring efforts (spawning surveys, smolt trapping, fish salvage, snorkeling, radio telemetry) conducted by CTWS and ODFW during the proceeding years have observed salmon and steelhead presence in many areas considered unoccupied prior to the inception of the HRPP. However no deliberate and systematic effort has been made to map the distribution of these reintroduced, supplemented, and hopefully expanding populations since the initial surveys at the beginning of the Hood River M&E program. We believe it is time to reinvestigate and potentially redraw the map of salmon and steelhead distribution in the Hood River basin.",
