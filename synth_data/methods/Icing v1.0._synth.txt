2. Abstract:
Icing events can significantly affect aquatic ecosystems, both in the short and long term. To understand their impact in a specific basin, it is essential to monitor their frequency and magnitude. Weekly observations of icing in the river and its tributaries are conducted to gather this data. This method allows for informed decision-making regarding habitat management and conservation efforts.

3. Description:
The text discusses the importance of monitoring icing events in a basin to evaluate their effects on biota and physical structures. Icing events can have detrimental short-term consequences, but they may also provide long-term benefits to habitat structures under certain conditions. To determine the frequency and magnitude of these events, regular weekly observations are made at the river and its tributaries. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of icing events' role in the aquatic ecosystem, providing valuable insights for managing and preserving habitats effectively.

4. Target:
The primary focus is to determine the frequency and magnitude of icing events in a basin through weekly observations.

5. Constraints:
- Regular access to the river and its tributaries may be limited due to weather conditions or other external factors, affecting the consistency of observations.
- The accuracy of the method relies on consistent and thorough data collection during weekly observations.
- Seasonal variations in icing events may require adjustments to observation schedules or methods.
