  "background": "More recenttrophic studies have determined that Smallmouth Bass and Walleye are becoming more abundant in the mid-Columbia River and their predatory impacts to juvenile salmonids in unknow, Monitoring diet composition and relative predation rates during the spring outmigrationwill help shape management decisions for piscivore management in the Columbia River. Temporal stratification of sites during sampling will provide data representative of the period of greatest overlap between non-native predator fishes and rearing/migrating juvenile salmonids.",
