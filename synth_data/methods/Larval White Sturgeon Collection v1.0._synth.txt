2. Abstract: Larval fish collection is crucial for the preservation of threatened or endangered fish species. The method involves using plankton drift nets to effectively capture live larvae during their dispersal phase, which are then used in a conservation aquaculture program. This process begins when larval monitoring methods detect a spike in numbers of early free embryo stages, indicating an upcoming pulse of drifting larvae (Howell and McLellan 2013a; 2013b; 2014a; 2014b). This approach increases the chances of obtaining live specimens for conservation efforts.
3. Description: The text details a method for collecting larval fish, which involves the deployment and utilization of plankton drift nets to effectively capture live larvae during their dispersal phase. This process begins when larval monitoring methods detect a spike in numbers of early free embryo stages, indicating an upcoming pulse of drifting larvae (Howell and McLellan 2013a; 2013b; 2014a; 2014b). The captured larvae are then used in a conservation aquaculture program. No further details about the specifics of this program or the monitoring methods are provided in the text.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to collect live larval fish specimens for use in a conservation aquaculture program, with the ultimate goal of preserving threatened or endangered fish species.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the availability and accessibility of the larval fish during their dispersal phase, as well as the need for effective larval monitoring methods to detect a spike in numbers of early free embryo stages. Additionally, the success of the conservation aquaculture program may also be a constraint, as it requires suitable conditions and resources to successfully raise the captured larvae to maturity.
