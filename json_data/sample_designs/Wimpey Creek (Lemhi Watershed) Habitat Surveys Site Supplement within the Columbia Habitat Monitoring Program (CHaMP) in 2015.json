  "description": "<p>CHaMP&nbsp;is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010).&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;salmonids&nbsp;and/or their habitat. The implementation of&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;56.3,&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;57, and&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;3.&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel (see section 1.6), at least 9 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lemhi&rsquo;s&nbsp;primary objective was to estimate habitat condition for the&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;subbasin, and estimate the habitat condition in the&nbsp;priority&nbsp;drainages&nbsp;(see strata list). The&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;status and trends sampling design consisted of 45 unique sites sampled over three years (the standard&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;design) and was supplemented with 72 sites funded by the&nbsp;ISEMP&nbsp;program until 2013.&nbsp; The Steelhead (Snake River Basin&nbsp;DPS) -&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;River and &nbsp;the Chinook Salmon (Snake River Spring/Summer-run&nbsp;ESU) -&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;River were the populations of interest. &nbsp;The original rationale was to allocate annual sites across the smaller tributaries to get a broad coverage of the diversity of habitat types, and use more rotating panel sites in the larger tributaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, &nbsp;additional sites were needed to supplement the design on&nbsp;Wimpey&nbsp;Creek due to landowner denials and lack of access to sites. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4/18/16:</strong> &nbsp;Field Season 2015 wrap up: &nbsp;Lem-000018&nbsp;used as RP2 in 2015 and was moved from the Extra panel to Wimpey&nbsp;RP2 in prep for 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
