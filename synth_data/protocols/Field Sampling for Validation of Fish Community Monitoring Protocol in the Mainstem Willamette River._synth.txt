 1. Abstract: This text describes a collaborative project between Oregon State University (OSU) and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) to monitor fish communities in the Willamette River basin. The project aims to collect data on the abundance, richness, and proportion of native and non-native fish species and salmonids using boat and backpack electrofishing methods. The data will be used to validate past monitoring protocols, assess the repeatability of different sampling methods, and evaluate the status of fish communities in the basin.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: The value of this project lies in its ability to provide valuable information on the ecological status and trends of fish communities in the Willamette River basin. The problem statement is that there is a lack of comprehensive data on how different species of fish use mainstem rearing habitats, particularly during warmer seasons and water temperatures. The desired outcomes of this project include validating past monitoring protocols, determining the repeatability of different sampling methods, assessing the status of fish communities in the basin, and providing a common archive of ecological data for future reference.
3. Description: This text describes a collaborative research project between OSU and ODFW to monitor fish communities in the Willamette River basin using boat and backpack electrofishing methods. The project aims to collect data on the abundance, richness, and proportion of native and non-native fish species and salmonids across a range of habitats in the mainstem Willamette, McKenzie, Santiam, and Middle Fork Willamette rivers. The data collected will be used to validate past monitoring protocols, determine the repeatability of different sampling methods, assess the status of fish communities in the basin, and provide a common archive of ecological data for future reference.
4. Objectives:
- Objective 1: Make categorical estimates of the abundance of native and non-native fish species and salmonids across a range of habitats in the Willamette River basin.
Summary of Solution Coverage: This objective covers the need to collect comprehensive data on the abundance, richness, and proportion of different fish species in the basin.
Keywords: Abundance, native fish, non-native fish, salmonids, categorical estimates, habitats, Willamette River basin.
- Objective 2: Determine the repeatability of boat and backpack electrofishing methods for sampling fish communities in the Willamette River basin.
Summary of Solution Coverage: This objective covers the need to determine the effectiveness and reliability of different sampling methods.
Keywords: Repeatability, boat electrofishing, backpack electrofishing, sampling methods, Willamette River basin.
- Objective 3: Assess the status of native and non-native fish communities in the Willamette River basin using data collected from the proposed sampling protocols.
Summary of Solution Coverage: This objective covers the need to evaluate the ecological status and trends of fish communities in the basin.
Keywords: Native fish, non-native fish, ecological status, trends, Willamette River basin.
5. Target: The primary focus or goal of this protocol is to collect comprehensive data on the abundance, richness, and proportion of native and non-native fish species and salmonids in the Willamette River basin using boat and backpack electrofishing methods.
6. Constraints: The main constraint for this protocol is the need for consistent environmental conditions between 2011-13 and 2017, as well as similar electrofishing efficiency, crew experience and ability among years. Changes in fish communities must also be detectable using this protocol, with sufficient sampling being conducted to effectively evaluate the protocol. The time frame and other logistics in 2017 must also be consistent with past efforts.
