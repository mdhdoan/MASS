  "abstractText": "Fisheries managers and researchers often need to measure the performance of a particular fishery, including catch and angler effort, in order to assess the affects of a management action. Creel surveys have long been a useful tool in measuring these and other performance indicators. The access-access survey design is particularly useful for bodies of water with a relatively small number of access points. This methods describes calculation of fishing effort, catch and harvest from data collected from such surveys.",
