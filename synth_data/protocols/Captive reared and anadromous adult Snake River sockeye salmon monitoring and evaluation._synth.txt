 1. Abstract: The text describes the importance of monitoring and evaluating adult Snake River sockeye salmon as part of a spread-the-risk philosophy. The protocol involves collecting biological data from anadromous returning adults, assigning those returns back to release strategies for survival estimates, identifying spatial structure of spawning areas (redds), and documenting spawn timing.
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes: The value of this study comes from the importance of preserving and understanding the Snake River sockeye salmon population. The problem being addressed is the need to monitor and evaluate the success of release strategies for hatchery-raised adults. The desired outcome is to gain a better understanding of the survival rates, spawning behavior, and distribution of released adults.
3. Description: The text details the specific methods used in this protocol, including Parentage Based Tagging (PBT) genetic analysis and basin trap collections. These methods are used to collect biological data from anadromous returning adults, assign those returns back to release strategies for survival estimates, identify spatial structure of spawning areas (redds), and document spawn timing.
4. Objectives: The objective is to gain a better understanding of the survival rates, spawning behavior, and distribution of released adult sockeye salmon in the Snake River. This objective covers the entire problem statement of preserving and understanding the Snkey River sockeye salmon population. Keywords include: monitoring, evaluation, spread-the-risk philosophy, hatchery-raised adults, Parentage Based Tagging (PBT) genetic analysis, basin trap collections, survival rates, spawning behavior, and distribution.
5. Target: The primary focus of the protocol is on understanding the success of release strategies for hatchery-raised adult sockeye salmon in the Snake River.
6. Constraints: The constraints for this protocol include the availability of anadromous sockeye salmon, the use of basin trap locations, and the reliance on volitional spawning by released adults.
