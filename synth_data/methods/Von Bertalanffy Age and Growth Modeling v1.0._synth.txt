2. Abstract:
The Von Bertalanffy growth function is a widely used method in fisheries to understand fish growth patterns by relating age to length or weight. Despite some limitations, it remains popular due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Growth models play a crucial role in making informed management decisions related to fish populations, such as setting minimum length regulations for sport fisheries.

3. Description:
The Von Bertalanffy growth function is extensively utilized within the field of fisheries science. Although it has certain limitations (Roff 1980), it remains one of the most commonly used growth models for fish populations (Quist et al. 2012). The method establishes a relationship between the age and size (length or weight) of fish in a population, providing valuable information to researchers and scientists. This data is essential for comparing the performance of fish species across different aquatic systems and informing critical management decisions.

4. Target:
The primary focus of the Von Bertalanffy growth function in fisheries is to understand fish growth patterns and facilitate informed decision-making for fish population management.

5. Constraints:
Despite its widespread use, the Von Bertalanffy growth function has limitations that may affect its accuracy in certain contexts. Researchers should be aware of these constraints when interpreting results and making management decisions based on this method's output.
