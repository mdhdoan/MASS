2. Abstract: This method outlines the Department of Ecology's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for field procedures to collect suspended particulate matter from stormwater runoff using passive sediment traps. The SOP aims to ensure consistent installation, comparability with existing and future monitoring programs, and exclusion of sediment loadings determination due to the design bias of sediment traps. The traps capture representative samples for characterization and source control purposes while being installed in high energy storm drains with pipe diameters of 24 inches or greater.
3. Description: This SOP details the procedure for collecting suspended particulate matter from stormwater runoff using passive sediment traps. These traps are designed to passively capture suspended particulate matter and not bed load material. The method highlights the importance of stable construction, installation in pipe diameters of 24 inches or greater, and placement where velocity flows are greater than 5 feet per second through a pipe. It also emphasizes that flexibility of trap design is allowed but may require adjusting sampling procedures described in this SOP.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to establish standard operating procedures for collecting suspended particulate matter from stormwater runoff using passive sediment traps.
5. Constraints: This method has constraints such as the requirement of a large storm event to inundate the sample bottle, and the inability to determine sediment loadings due to the design bias of sediment traps. Additionally, trap design flexibility may require adjusting sampling procedures described in this SOP.
