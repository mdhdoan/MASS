2. Abstract: This method, derived from the EMAP protocol, offers a simplified adaptation of the Robison and Beschta (1990) approach for measuring large woody debris (LWD) in western wadable streams. The method enables quantitative estimates of LWD number, size, volume, and distribution within a stream reach, providing valuable data to assess ecological condition. By determining diameter class, length class, and tallying LWD both within and spanning the bankfull channel, this method assists in understanding the impact of LWD on stream health.
3. Description: This method, adapted from an EMAP protocol, is designed for measuring LWD in western wadable streams. LWD is defined as woody material with a small end diameter of at least 10 cm (4 in.) and a length of at least 1.5 m (5 ft.). The method entails four steps: (1) determining the diameter class of the large end, (2) establishing the length class, (3) tallying LWD within a segment that are at least partially within the bankfull channel, and (4) tallying LWD not within but spanning the bankfull channel. These measurements help quantify LWD, providing insights into the ecological condition of streams.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to offer a simplified approach for measuring LWD in western wadable streams, enabling the collection of data essential for assessing the ecological condition of these water bodies.
5. Constraints: This method requires clear definitions and consistent measurements of LWD, bankfull channel, diameter class, and length class. Variations in these factors might affect the accuracy and comparability of results.
