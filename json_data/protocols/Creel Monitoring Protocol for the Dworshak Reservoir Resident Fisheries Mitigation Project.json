  "background": "The Dworshak Reservoir Fisheries Mitigation Project was designed to mitigate for losses of resident fish and associated fisheries due to the construction and operation of Dworshak Dam. One of the goals of the project is to improve the resident fisheries within the reservoir and one of the objectives specifies catch rates and average size of fish in the creel for the kokanee fishery. The only way to determine whether these objectives are met is to perform a creel census. While Dworshak Reservoir is a large water body, it has limited access points and little opportunity for angling from shore. Therefore, it is well suited to an access-access type survey design.",
