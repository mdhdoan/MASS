2. Abstract: This method, Size Selectivity of Fishing Gear, is crucial for unbiased stock assessments as it addresses the impact of gear size selectivity on estimates of size structure, growth, and mortality. The approach combines direct and indirect techniques to calculate or estimate selectivity. Direct estimation requires knowing the length distribution of the population, while indirect methods use mark-recapture or compare catch frequencies across hook sizes/meshes. A maximum-likelihood method generates selection curves describing the probability of capturing (retaining) fish within each length class, enabling adjustments to the catch data for a more accurate stock assessment.
3. Description: The necessity of evaluating size selectivity of fishing gear in stock assessments is highlighted due to its potential bias on size structure, growth, and mortality estimates (McCombie and Fry 1960; Jensen 1982; Rudstam et al. 1984; Willis et al. 1985; Colombo et al. 2008; Gwinn et al. 2010). Direct estimation of selectivity is possible when the length distribution of the population is known, but such information is rarely available (Millar and Holst 1997). Mark-recapture experiments provide direct estimates (Method 4176), but they are often cost-prohibitive (Pierce 1994).

For indirect estimation, this method focuses on comparing observed catch frequencies across various hook sizes or meshes in fishing gears like setlines and gillnets. The maximum-likelihood approach of Millar and Holst (1997), known as the SELECT method, is used to estimate parameters of log-linear selectivity models (Normal location, Normal scale, Gamma, Lognormal, and Bi-normal) and generate selection curves for each hook or mesh size. These selectivity curves describe the probability of capturing (retaining) a fish within each length class, which can be combined to create an overall setline or gillnet selectivity curve. This curve helps adjust catch data by applying the probability of retention for each length class to the total catch within that class, resulting in more accurate stock assessments.

4. Target: Improving the accuracy of stock assessments by accounting for size selectivity of fishing gear.
5. Constraints: The method relies on having detailed information about catch frequencies across various hook sizes or meshes. Additionally, direct estimation methods require knowing the length distribution of the population, which is rarely available. Mark-recapture experiments can be cost-prohibitive and may not always be feasible.
