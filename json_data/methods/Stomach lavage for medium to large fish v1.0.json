  "abstractText": "The purpose of stomach lavage is to displace and/or force out stomach contents by regurgitation using a steady stream of water in order to samplestomach contents from live fish. Stomach contents are typically analyzed to describe diet composition. Diet compositionmay be further analyzed to determine prey selectivity,amounts of different prey consumed, and the energy content ofconsumed prey. Techniques describes in this method are applicable to fish6 and larger. Success of the techniques described anduse of anesthesia depends on the species of interest. For example, both Nelle (1999) and Naughton et al. (2004) did not need to anesthize smallmouth bass during lavage.",
