  "abstractText": "The number of juvenile salmonids migrating downstream past a rotary screw trap in a given period is estimated using an estimate of trap efficiency (Method ID: 134) and the trap catch during the period. Period estimates and their associated variances are combined over a migration season to estimate the number of migrants in a migration season with an associated confidence interval. Migrant abundance is estimated by conducting weekly trap efficiency tests throughout the migratory year at the trap site.",
