 1. Abstract: The Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) aims to maintain and restore aquatic and riparian ecosystems to desired conditions on federal lands in the Forest Plan area. A comprehensive monitoring program, Aquatic and Riparian Effectiveness Monitoring Program (AREMP), is established to track changes in watershed condition over time, collect consistent data, minimize errors due to sampling and observer bias, and provide a basis for management decisions. The program involves adaptive management, predictive models, decision support models, and assessment of 250 watersheds' condition.
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes: Values include the importance of maintaining healthy aquatic and riparian ecosystems, efficient use of resources, high-quality data collection, and adaptive management. The problem statement is the need to assess, monitor, and improve the condition of aquatic and riporian ecosystems in the Forest Plan area. Desired outcomes are improved watershed conditions, efficient data-driven decision making, and reduced long-term monitoring costs through predictive models.
3. Description: AREMP uses a decision support model that evaluates individual indicators and aggregates evaluation scores to determine watershed condition. The stream data collected in the field represents about 2/3 of the data included in the decision support model. Adaptive management is employed by analyzing trends in watershed condition and identifying causes of unsuitable or unacceptable conditions, while predictive models aim to improve use of monitoring data and potentially reduce the number of attributes measured.
4. Objectives: Develop a regional-scale adaptive monitoring framework, create predictive models that utilize monitoring data, build decision support models that assess watershed condition, and collect information on upslope, riparian, and in-channel attributes within 250 watersheds to evaluate their condition. This objective covers the entire problem statement. Keywords: Adaptive Management, Predictive Models, Decision Support Models, Watershed Condition Assessment, Monitoring Framework.
5. Target: Comprehensive assessment and monitoring of aquatic and riparian ecosystems in the Northwest Forest Plan area.
6. Constraints: The constraints for this protocol include potential limitations in data availability, budget restrictions, and the challenge of minimizing errors due to sampling and observer bias in data collection.
