2. Abstract: This method describes a procedure for estimating the total number of fish using a facility when complete enumeration is not feasible due to limitations in holding tank capacities, staffing levels, or regulatory restrictions. The approach involves taking timed sub-samples every hour, even during non-homogeneous behavior periods such as fish passage through screening facilities. When sampling cannot occur, the method employs extrapolation and temporal stratification techniques to estimate catch during unsampled periods, ensuring a more accurate representation of fish populations using the facility.
3. Description: The necessity for this method arises from the impracticality of complete enumeration in many cases due to capacity constraints or regulatory restrictions on handling certain species. This issue is addressed by utilizing timed sub-sampling techniques, where sub-samples are taken at least once per hour over 24 hours a day and seven days a week during non-homogeneous behavior periods such as fish passage through screening facilities.

When sampling cannot occur due to reasons like mechanical failure, heavy debris, or high-density of non-target fish, the method uses extrapolation techniques by interpolating catch from the previous and following sampling periods. Additionally, temporal (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) or diel (day and night) stratification can be used to minimize variance in estimates while maintaining biological/environmental relevance.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to provide an accurate estimation of the total number of fish using a facility when complete enumeration is not feasible due to practical or regulatory constraints.
5. Constraints: This method requires continuous monitoring (24 hours per day and 7 days per week) during non-homogeneous behavior periods, such as fish passage through screening facilities. Additionally, there are limitations on the use of extrapolation techniques when sampling cannot occur, which could impact the accuracy of estimates.
