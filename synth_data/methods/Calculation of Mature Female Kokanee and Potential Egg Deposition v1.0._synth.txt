2. Abstract: This method is crucial for estimating the number of mature female kokanee in Lake Pend Oreille. By utilizing data from hydroacoustics, trawling, and kokanee processing, this approach provides a reliable and accurate assessment of the kokanee population. The use of multiple data sources enhances the method's credibility and ensures robust results.
3. Description: The methodology described involves integrating data from hydroacoustics, trawling, and kokanee processing to determine the number of mature female kokanee in Lake Pend Oreille. Hydroacoustic surveys are used to estimate the biomass and abundance of fish in the lake, while trawling offers a more direct method for collecting samples. Kokanee processing involves examining the collected samples to identify and count mature females, providing a concrete measure of the target population. By combining these techniques, this method offers an accurate and reliable means of assessing the kokanee population in Lake Pend Oreille.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to determine the number of mature female kokanee in Lake Pend Oreille.
5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method may include limitations in the accuracy and precision of hydroacoustic surveys, variability in trawling efficiency, and challenges in identifying and counting mature female kokanee during processing. Additionally, environmental factors such as water temperature, turbidity, and fish behavior may impact the effectiveness of this method.
