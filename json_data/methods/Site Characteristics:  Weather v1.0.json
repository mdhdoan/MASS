  "abstractText": "Information gained on the use of mainstem habitats by juvenile salmonids will be used to help Action Agencies and the Services make adaptive management decisions on a year-to-year basis, will provide valuable occupancy and habitat use information in warmer water conditions to inform long-term management planning, and will aid in evaluating the effectiveness of temperature and habitat restoration mitigation measures.The purpose of the method is to characterize sites where field crews collect physical habitat data at sites sampled for fish and in known coldwater refuges to determine their suitability as fish habitat. However, this method can be used at any field site to document current weather conditions.",
