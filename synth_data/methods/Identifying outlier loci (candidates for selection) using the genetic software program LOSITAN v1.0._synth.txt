2. Abstract: This text describes the use of genetic markers, specifically single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in determining the population of origin for Pacific salmon. Admixture analyses are highlighted as particularly useful for complex aggregations of these fish. A method called LOSITAN is explained for identifying outlier loci, which can reveal local adaptation and candidate genes under selection. These outlier loci may be valuable in cases where neutral loci show little difference among populations of interest.
3. Description: The text begins by discussing the use of genetic markers, specifically multilocus genotype data from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), for admixture analyses in ascertainaining the population of origin of individuals or mixtures of individuals in complex aggregations of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. It is mentioned that SNPs can be discovered in nonmodel organisms with relative ease and can be characterized in the coding and regulatory regions of the genome influenced by selection. Those influenced by diversifying selection may show atypically high levels of differentiation among populations. If the goal is to describe neutral genetic diversity and structure within a species, these SNPs may need to be excluded from analyses. However, these SNPs may allow the investigation of local adaptation in natural populations and allow for the identification of candidate genes under selection. They may also be particularly valuable for genetic stock identification in cases where neutral loci show little difference among populations of interest. The text then describes procedures for running the software program LOSITAN (Antao et al. 2008) for identifying outlier loci, which can reveal local adaptation and candidate genes under selection. There are a variety of genetic software programs that can run different outlier tests with different type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) error rates.
4. Target: The primary focus of the method is to identify outlier loci in Pacific salmon using the software program LOSITAN, which can reveal local adaptation and candidate genes under selection. These outlier loci may be valuable for genetic stock identification in cases where neutral loci show little difference among populations of interest.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need for genetic data from Pacific salmon populations, as well as access to and understanding of how to use the LOSITAN software program. Additionally, there are a variety of genetic software programs that can run different outlier tests with different type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) error rates, which may affect the results obtained from the analysis.
