  "description": "<p>\u200b</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHaMP&nbsp;is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010).&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;salmonids&nbsp;and/or their habitat. The implementation of&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;56.3,&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;57, and&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;3.&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel (see section 1.6), at least 9 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHaMP&rsquo;s&nbsp;Wenatchee design developed from a 9 year history of&nbsp;GRTS&nbsp;based site selection and habitat monitoring.&nbsp; The legacy design contained a list of sites sampled annually (some sites with missing years), and a set of once only sites.&nbsp; Consequently the&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;design continues many of the legacy sites carried over into&nbsp;ChaMP&rsquo;s&nbsp;valley class and public/private stratification.&nbsp;&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;targets the Wenatchee River Steelhead population (Upper Columbia River&nbsp;DPS).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2017 Design Updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017 field data collection effort was reduced to 15 sites in the Wenatchee. &nbsp;The design was updated such that annual sites were shifted to rotating panels (top use order). &nbsp;The design updates are noted in <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/1fycyk63r0oonoj/Wenachee_Reduced_2017_Design.xlsx?dl=0\">Wenatchee Reduced 2017 Design.xlsx</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/1fycyk63r0oonoj/Wenachee_Reduced_2017_Design.xlsx?dl=0\"><strong>2016 Design Updates:</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200bIn 2016 the CBW sites from the 2014-2015 Little Wenatchee intensive sampling effort were integrated back into the original sampling design as described in 2013. &nbsp;Changes made in 2014 and 2015 to accommodate the frame and repeat sampling remained in the 2016 design. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW 330923 was put back into the Transport-Public RP2 block, Use order 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW 382123 was put back into the Transport-Public RP1 block, Use order 3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW 391019 and 275627 were both put back into the Extra, Transport Public block as Use Orders 1 and 2, respectively (these were not sampled in 2014-2015)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW 117611&nbsp;was not sampled in 2014-2015 and was not part of the original 2013 design and therefore was not included in the 2016 design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW 461995 was sampled in 2015 but was not part of the original 2013 design and therefore was not included in the 2016 design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2015 Design Updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6/26/15: &nbsp;</strong>CBW05583-101099 from RP2 Transport-Public was sampled on last week&#39;s hitch and TQ&nbsp;discovered that this site was no longer slated for sampling as part of RP2 based on design updates in 2014. &nbsp;This means that a site had to be dropped from sampling from the remaining unsampled 2015 sites to accommodate the &#39;spent&#39; effort. &nbsp;After review of the remaining sites and current sampling domain in GIS, TQ (steve fortney) and CV decided it would be reasonable to not sample WENMASTER-17 (RP2 source public), which has not been sampled 2011-2014 and is also located in EF Mission Creek, close to the already-sampled 101099. &nbsp;Also note that there are 2 other sites in EF Mission Creek within close proximity, so reducing additional effort in this stream is preferred to balance out effort in fish site sample (don&#39;t need more sites in EF mission for fish). &nbsp;Note that a quick review of draft riverstyles indicated 101099 and WENMASTER-17 are in different riverstyles, but until these classes have been finalized it was decided not to use this information to inform a change in sampling in 2015. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The block count for RP2-Transport Public was increased by 1 and the count for RP2-Source-Public was decreased&nbsp;by 1 for 2015 and out years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All core&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;designs were updated to accommodate effort that will go towards the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://isemp.egnyte.com/dl/EcV8YyGyV5\" style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 16.7999992370605px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">10% repeat design for&nbsp;CHaMP</a>. &nbsp; The design update will result in 3 annual sites from the active design (e.g. 2014) and move one to each rotating panel. &nbsp;This will result in a net freeing of 2 visits each year that can be used to revisit 2 sites. &nbsp;This change preserves the annual sites within the design and adjusts the frequency of sampling. &nbsp;2 sites slated for sampling in the current year (e.g. 2015) will be randomly selected for repeat sampling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Wenatchee, the following sites were selected. &nbsp;Strata selection was limited to those with &gt;1 annual site per stratum in the 2014 design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WC503432-000038, Depositional-Private, Use order 4 to Rotating Panel 3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WENMASTER-000071, Source-Public, Use order 3 to Rotating Panel 2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WENMASTER-000195, Transport-Private, Use Order 3, to Rotating Panel 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5 sites will be sampled in the Little Wenatchee (1 of which is a CBW Little Wenatchee stratum site). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Block counts were adjusted to accommodate the reduction in annual effort for 10% repeat samples, and the CBW Little Wenatchee Block count was reduced to reflect the actual number of sites sampled in that Block this year (1 site). &nbsp;One more rotating panel 2 Depositional-Public&nbsp;block count reduction was done (1 site) to get sampling down to 23 sites total (Little Wenatchee and rest of Wenatchee). &nbsp;I suspect this reduction was needed as follow up to the Little Wenatchee adjustments done in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2014 Site selection updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014 the frame was reduced to reflect a more accurate steelhead frame. &nbsp;The GRTS draw was not redone, however the sample allocation among panels and strata were adjusted to reflect the proportion of the frame in each strata. &nbsp;13 annual sites remained within the frame and these were kept. &nbsp;For Rotating Panels 1-3, site allocation was adjusted to match the frame length for each panel. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depositional-Private: 4 sites for each Rotating Panel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depositional-Public: 5 sites for each Rotating Panel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source-Private: 1 site for each Rotating Panel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source-Public: 1 site for each Rotating Panel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transport-Private: 1 site for each Rotating Panel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transport-Public:0 sites for each Rotating Panel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sites within the new target frame but rejected in previous 2011-2013 evaluations were kept within their native stratum, but it is assumed these will remain rejected for 2014. &nbsp;1 site was moved from RP2-Transport Public to Annual-Transport Public because it was sampled in 2012 but will not be needed in 2015, and the Annual-Transport-Public block was short 1 previously sampled site.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6 previously sampled annual sites were removed from the design due to the change in frame:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WC503432-000152, WENMASTER-000269, CBW05583-492715, CBW05583-060011, WC503432-000046, WC503432-000048.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sampling effort was also modified in 2014 to allow intensive sampling of Little Wenatchee. &nbsp;4 sites were dropped from sampling: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200bWENMASTER-000310,&nbsp;WENMASTER-000298, WENMASTER-000055, WENMASTER-000295</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2013 Site selection updates:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were no site selection&nbsp;updates in 2013. Several effectiveness monitoring sites measured by Tetra Tech were added to the block design of the Wenatchee in a new stratum (Restoration Tetra Tech) but this did not alter the 2012 Wenatchee study design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>2012 Site selection updates:</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2011 Wenatchee frame contained high proportion of frame errors (sites that were above barriers).&nbsp; Consequently, the number of&nbsp;oversample&nbsp;sites was exceeded in several blocks.&nbsp; The frame was revised to reflect a more realistic set of target sites.&nbsp; The set of 2011 sites deemed target were set aside as legacy sites.&nbsp; Then the non-legacy sites were input to the &lsquo;strat_panel_function10.2.r&rsquo; by valley class to create an ordered site list attached as an addendum to each block.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200b\u200b<strong>Master sample&nbsp;GRTS&nbsp;input file: 2011 file&nbsp;recoded&nbsp;with updated Target frame.&nbsp;</strong>Wen2012Review_20120606.csv\u200b</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>R code</em></strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Wenatchee.Design.4.26.2011.r (contains changes for 2012)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Extra Site Output files for 2012:</strong>&nbsp;wen.trans.extra.2012.csv, wen.source.extra.dsgn.20120507.csv, wen.dep.extra.20120507.csv</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Design Documentation Files:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://isemp.egnyte.com/h-s/20140130/ca2c0bb7ed51415c\">WenatcheeDesignDocs.zip&nbsp;</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n",
