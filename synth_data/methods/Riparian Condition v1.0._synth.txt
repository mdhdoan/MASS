2. Abstract: This method outlines the importance of analyzing riparian zones to evaluate the health and level of disturbance of stream corridors. The assessment includes studying riparian structure, which describes the type and amount of vegetation within the zone, as well as canopy cover, which moderates stream temperatures and contributes organic materials to the stream. Human land-use activities within the riparian area are also considered, as they affect riparian vegetation and, in turn, impact aquatic habitat for listed fish species.
3. Description: The method begins by discussing riparian structure, which provides valuable information on the health and level of disturbance of a stream corridor. The type and amount of various types of vegetation within the riparian zone (within 10 m) are analyzed to make this assessment. Next, the concept of riparian disturbance is introduced, referring to human land-use activities within the riparian area (within 30 m from the edge of the channel). These activities, such as walls, dikes, and agriculture, have an effect on the riparian vegetation, which in turn affects the quantity and quality of aquatic habitat for listed fish species. Canopy cover is also discussed as an important factor in riparian zones. It moderates stream temperatures through shading and controls bank stability, while also providing inputs of coarse and fine particulate organic materials. Organics from riparian vegetation become food for stream organisms and structure to create and maintain complex channel habitat.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to evaluate the health and level of disturbance of stream corridors through analyzing riparian structure, canopy cover, and human land-use activities.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method are accessibility to the riparian zone and the availability of data on human land-use activities within the area.
