2. Abstract: The pebble count procedure is a method used to quantify streambed substrate composition without the need for laboratory analysis. This approach saves time and resources, while still providing valuable data on bed materials that influence channel stability and resistance to scour during high flow events. By measuring substrate characteristics along main channel and side channels transects within bankfull constraints, this method also helps assess the importance of bed load transport frequency for aquatic organisms such as fish spawning and cover-seeking species.

3. Description: The pebble count procedure is a non-destructive sampling technique that focuses on quantifying streambed substrate composition based on size distribution. It involves taking measurements at regular intervals along predefined transects within the bankfull constraints of main channels and side channels. These measurements help to characterize bed materials, which play a critical role in channel morphology formation and maintenance. The frequency of bed load transport, facilitated by these substrate characteristics, can impact fish spawning and other aquatic organisms that rely on the substrate for cover.

4. Target: The primary focus of the pebble count procedure is to provide a rapid, cost-effective method for assessing streambed substrate composition without requiring laboratory analysis. This information helps in understanding channel morphology, stability, and bed load transport frequency.

5. Constraints: Although the pebble count procedure offers numerous advantages, it does have some limitations. For instance, it relies on visual estimations of substrate particle sizes, which might introduce subjectivity or inconsistencies. Additionally, this method may not accurately capture fine sediment particles or complex substrate compositions with various embedded materials.
