  "abstractText": "The plan includes export of invertebrates (aquatic and terrestrial) and coarse organic detritus from headwaters to downstream habitats as an attribute of freshwater productivity.  Investigators will follow the methods described in Wipfli and Gregovich (2002) to assess energy sources for downstream food webs. The method requires the placement of sampling stations near tributary junctions of fishless and fish-bearing streams. Specially-modified drift nets (Wipfli and Gregovich 2002) will capture invertebrates and particulate organic matter.  Invertebrate transport will be reported as numbers per day and dry mass (mg) per day. Debris transport will be reported as dry mass (g) per m^3 water and dry mass (g) per day. This work will be conducted monthly.The plan also includes benthic macroinvertebrate composition as an attribute of freshwater productivity. Investigators will follow the targeted-riffle-sample method described in Peck et al. (2001). This method requires at least eight independent kick-net samples from riffles within sites or reaches. The eight samples are combined, sieved to remove debris and sediments, and then processed in a lab. Samples will be analyzed according to the River InVertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS) (Hawkins et al. 2001).",
