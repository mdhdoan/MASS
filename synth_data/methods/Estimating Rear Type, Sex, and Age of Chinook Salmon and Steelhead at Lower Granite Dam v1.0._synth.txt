 Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize and analyze the text you provided. Here are the five keywords that I think are most relevant to the method being described:

1. Anadromous fish management programs
2. Snake River basin
3. Steelhead and Chinook salmon populations
4. Data collection and analysis
5. Population viability assessment

Now, let's move on to the different sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
The Snake River basin is home to several anadromous fish management programs aimed at mitigating the impacts of hydroelectric dam construction and recovering ESA-listed wild steelhead and salmon stocks. However, specific data on steelhead and Chinook salmon populations are lacking, making it difficult to assess their viability. To address this issue, a method for collecting and analyzing key population parameters at Lower Granite Dam is being used. This method involves sampling steelhead and Chinook salmon from the run using a systematic random sample with a pre-determined overall sample rate goal. The data collected is then used to estimate key parameters of those populations at the Snake River basin scale, such as abundance, age composition, genetic diversity, recruits per spawner, and survival rates.
3. Description:
The text describes a method for assessing the viability of steelhead and Chinook salmon populations in the Snake River basin. The method involves collecting data on these populations at Lower Granite Dam using a systematic random sample with a pre-determined overall sample rate goal. The data collected includes information on the aggregate escapement of Snake River steelhead and Chinook salmon, as well as further decomposition by sex, age, and genetic stock. This data is then used to estimate key population parameters at the Snake River basin scale, with the exception of the Tucannon River, Washington, population. The text also highlights the importance of collecting specific data on steelhead and Chinook salmon populations, particularly key parameters such as abundance, age composition, genetic diversity, recruits per spawner, and survival rates, in order to assess their viability.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to collect and analyze key population parameters of steelhead and Chinook salmon in the Snake River basin in order to assess their viability and contribute to their recovery.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is the lack of specific data on steelhead and Chinook salmon populations, particularly key parameters such as abundance, age composition, genetic diversity, recruits per spawner, and survival rates. This makes it difficult to assess the viability of these populations and develop effective recovery plans. Additionally, the method only collects data on these populations at Lower Granite Dam, which may not be representative of the entire Snake River basin.
