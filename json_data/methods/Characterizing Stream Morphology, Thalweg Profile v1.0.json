  "abstractText": "The Thalweg Profile is a longitudinal survey of depth, habitat class, presence of soft/small sediment deposits, and off-channel habitat at 100 equally spaced intervals (150 in streams less than 2.5 m wide) along the centerline between the two ends of the sampling reach. Thalweg refers to the flow path of the deepest water in a stream channel. Wetted width and bankfull width are measured and substrate size is evaluated at 21 equally spaced cross-sections (at 11 regular Transects A through K, plus 10 supplemental cross-sections spaced mid-way between each of these).",
