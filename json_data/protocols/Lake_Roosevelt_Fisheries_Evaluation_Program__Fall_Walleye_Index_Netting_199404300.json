  "background": "Fall walleye index netting (FWIN) is a multi-agency collaborative effort between the Spokane Tribe of Indians, Colville Confederated Tribes, and the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife. The standardized FWIN protocol was originally developed for lakes and rivers in Quebec by Morgan (2002) andwasmodified for use in Washington lakes and was initatied in 2002.In 2013 site selection was changed to aGeneralized Random Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) sampling.FWIN is conducted during the first week of November when water temperatures have cooled to 10 - 15 C. During this time walleye are evenly dispersed throughout the reservoir enabling researchers to collect a representative sample of the population. Experimental gill nets are set at randomly selected locations (GRTS) throughout the reservoir to collect walleye and burbot. Sampling gear consisted of 1.8 m (6 ft) by 61 m (200 ft) monofilament gillnets containing eight sections of increasing mesh sizes (25, 38, 51, 64, 76, 102, 127, and 152 mm). FWIN is used by mangers to assess and monitor changes in relative abundance, population structure, health, condition, and sex and sexual maturity of the walleye and burbot populations in Lake Roosevelt.",
