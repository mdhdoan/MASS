  "background": "The Asotin steelhead population as identified in the Snake River Salmon Recovery Plan for Southeast Washington (SRSRB 2006) has three Major Spawning Aggregations (MSA)and three minor Spawning Aggregations (mSA), while the Tucannon steelhead population consists of one MSA and four mSAs (Figure 1, Table 1). Ongoing adult and smolt monitoring are being funded in Asotin Creek (BPA project #2002-053-00), the Tucannon River, and the mainstem Snake River by the Bonneville Power Administration, Lower Snake River Compensation Program, and WashingtonDepartment ofFish and Wildlife(WDFW).~~Asotin and Tucannon steelhead are sole populations within the Lower Snake River Major Population Group (MPG). Both populations include steelhead using small Snake River tributaries that have little or no fish monitoring. Tributaries of the Tucannon River include Pataha, Alkali Flat, Deadman, and Penawawa Creeks. Almota Creek is the one Asotin Creek tributary that we will be sampling with this project, but other tributaries associated with Asotin Creek (Alpowa, George, Tenmile and Couse Creeks) are being sampled in the Asotin Creek Assessment Project . All but one of these tributaries (Alpowa Creek) are mSAs are not monitored for adult steelhead abundance or other Viable Salmonid Population (VSP) attributes. Our goal is to establish upstream migrant traps on at least two mSA tributaries per year, and rotate them from stream to stream every three years.Despite the comprehensive nature of these programs, uncertainty exists regarding the abundance and distribution of adult steelhead in unsampled tributaries, the biological association of those adults with core steelhead populations and the proportion of hatchery spawners in Asotin and Tucannon populations. Gathering this information is not practical during spawning surveys for steelhead, but is feasible with adult trapping. Without collecting the proposed adult abundance information we are unable to determine the population abundance baselines for Asotin and Tucannon steelhead or measure the progress towards meeting Endangered Species Act recovery. The inability to estimate total abundance does not meet the priorities of Viable Salmonid Population monitoring for ESA recovery (Crawford and Rumsey 2009), as required by the FCRPS BiOp.The proposed project would provide the following information for the Asotin and Tucannon populations:1) adult abundance,2) the proportion of hatchery origin spawners, origin of hatchery fish from coded wire tags or PIT tags,3) population age structure,4) proportional distribution of the populations in MSAs and mSAs, and5) contribute to genetic characterization of Snake River Basin steelhead (Project 201002600).We may alsoconduct spawning surveys in selected tributaries where weir operation is not possible or effective, or where information on spawning distribution is limited.",

  "id": 105,
  "assumptions": "<p>OBJ-1: 1) adult traps can be installed, maintained and operated adequately to successfully enumerate migrating adult steelhead 2) adult steelhead cannot ascend the stream without being enumerated, or they will accurately be estimated from mark &ndash;recapture techniques 3) marks and tags will not be missed during recapture</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OBJ-2: 1) that we will be able to tissue sample 30-100 unmarked steelhead per trap site/stream 2) that funding is available and the samples will be run for DNA and SNPs analyses, as part of the Snake River genetics database 3) that DNA analyses will be run with existing funding (project 20102600) to compare steelhead from these small tributaries with the core Asotin and Tucannon populations</p>\r\n",
