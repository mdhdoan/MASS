  "abstractText": "A visible implant elastomer(VIE) tag is a two-component biologically inert silicone polymerthat has shown good detection rates in short-term evaluations of some fish species like bluegillsLepomismacrochimus,coho salmon smoltsOncorhynchus kisutch,andvarious trout(Dewey and Zigler1996, Bailey et al. 1998, Hale and Gray 1998). VIE tagging is an appropriate mass marking technique that avoids the issues that arise from fin clipping like the limited number of fins, fin regeneration, and mortality caused by fin removal (Close and Jones 2002). In addition, most tagging (PIT, Floy, Carlin) is limited by fish size, fish smaller than 40 mm are too smallor require the death of the fish for visual identification (Leblanc and Noakes 2012). However, VIE tags have shown to be non-lethal and effective in the identification ofsmallbodied (25-40 mm) fish and juveniles(Leblanc and Noakes 2012).VIE tags are injected as a liquid that soon cures into a pliable, biocompatible solid (Northwest Marine Technology Inc. 2008). The tags are implanted beneath transparent or translucent tissue and remain externally visible (Northwest Marine Technology Inc. 2008).Tags may become difficult to detect in ambient light if growth is considerable and pigmented tissue is laid down over the tag, however some of the colored pigments used are fluorescent, and use of appropriate lighting can significantly enhance detection of tags.",
