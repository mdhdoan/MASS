2. Abstract: The method described is a systematic approach for estimating riparian woody cover, which involves measuring the percent of woody cover for groundstory, understory, and canopy cover in a 10mx10m plot along a riverbank. This method, based on the CHaMP-Riparian Structure Method and Peck et al. (2001), utilizes transects at five locations on both sides of the bank to calculate site-wide estimates of woody cover. The purpose is to provide a standardized, accurate, and efficient technique for assessing riparian vegetation structure in aquatic monitoring programs.
3. Description: The method outlines the procedure for estimating the percent woody cover as part of riparian vegetation assessment. Measurements are taken at five transects (1, 6, 11, 16, 21) on both the right and left banks within a 10mx10m plot that starts at bankfull. The percent woody cover is determined for three components: groundstory (woody shrubs), understory (woody shrubs), and canopy cover (big trees + small trees). These individual estimates are summed, resulting in values ranging from 0-300. A site-wide estimate of the percent woody cover is calculated by averaging the scores from all ten plots. The method references the CHaMP - Riparian Structure Method and follows the Peck et al. (2001) methods used in the EMAP program, ensuring standardization and comparability across studies.
4. Target: Standardized assessment of riparian woody cover for aquatic monitoring programs.
5. Constraints: Requires a consistent 10mx10m plot layout, transect locations, and specific definitions for groundstory, understory, and canopy cover to maintain accuracy and comparability in the estimates. Adherence to the described method is crucial for reliable results.
