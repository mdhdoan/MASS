2. Abstract: This method is designed to evaluate the potential risks associated with water withdrawals for fish species. By identifying and classifying the level of risk, this approach helps protect aquatic life from harm caused by screening or entrapment in water intake structures during peak withdrawal periods.
3. Description: Water withdrawals are defined as the number and relative size of water withdrawals within a specific stream reach (Lestelle et al., 2005). This method aims to assess the risk for fish species, focusing on entrainment and screening injuries. To effectively evaluate the significance of these withdrawals, data collection must be carried out during the month when water abstractions are at their highest. By following this procedure, stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding water management and protect vulnerable aquatic ecosystems.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to identify and mitigate potential risks to fish species from water withdrawals and screening processes.
5. Constraints: To successfully implement this method, accurate data on water withdrawals, particularly during peak months, are required. This may pose a challenge in regions where such information is not readily available or accurately tracked. Additionally, the effectiveness of the method depends on timely data collection and analysis to inform decision-making.
