  "abstractText": "These surveys are part of a long-term, interdisciplinary effort by academic and federal scientists to understand coastal ecosystems and biological and physical processes that may influence recruitment variability of salmon in Pacific Northwest waters. Presently, research is focused on examining the effects of biotic and abiotic environmental conditions on the early marine life history of coho and Chinook salmon. This research focused on the Columbia River Plume and its importance for juvenile salmon and higher trophic level predators because this is an area of high salmonid abundance and it is influenced by anthropogenic factors. Marine birds are abundant, highly mobile predators that consume fish and zooplankton found in the Columbia River Plume and adjacent coastal waters of the California Current. Due to the possibility ocean avian predation may affect early marine survival of juvenile salmon, this study is quantifying the distribution and abundance of marine birds at sea as well as the overlap of those birds with juvenile salmon distributions.",
