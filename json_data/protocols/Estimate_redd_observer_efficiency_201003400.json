  "background": "Redd counts are an important tool used to monitor salmonid populations. A key assumption of redd counts is that they are representative of the actual number of redds. However, numerous factors can potentially affect the detectability of redds and lead to errors in redds counts. However, this error associated with redd counts can result from the timing of counts (i.e., not representative of spawn timing), redd characteristics (e.g., redd size, redd age, and/or substrate composition), spawning habitat characteristics (e.g., stream size, water depth and clarity, and distance to cover), spawner densities (e.g., large number of redds and/or superimposition), and/or observer survey experience. As a result, the validity for redd counts for monitoring abundance of salmonid species need to be critically examined because erroneous counts may obscure important trends and potentially compromise the management and conservation of a species.",
