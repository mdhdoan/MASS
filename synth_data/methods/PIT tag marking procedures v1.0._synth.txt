2. Abstract: The use of Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags is a common method for marking and tracking salmonids in various scenarios, from small-scale operations to large hatchery programs. This technique involves collecting and anesthetizing fish, recording relevant data, tagging them with PIT tags, and allowing them to recover before releasing back into the population. The process is facilitated by semi-automated marking stations that increase efficiency while reducing handling time, thus minimizing stress on the fish.

3. Description: PIT tags are utilized for marking salmonids in different situations, including collecting and tagging individual fish in their natal streams or mass marking thousands of fish within hatcheries. The process generally consists of four common steps: (1) collecting fish before tagging, (2) anesthetizing fish in small batches for tagging, (3) recording information about each animal and correlating it with the injected tag, and (4) allowing fish to recover from handling, tagging, and anesthesia before returning them to their cohorts.

Marking stations are employed to maximize tagging rates and minimize time spent without fresh water for the fish. A typical marking station includes a PIT tag transceiver (reader), a computer with specialized data collection and validation software, and potentially peripheral hardware such as a digitizer or an electronic balance. The configuration of these stations varies depending on the type of marking operation: mass marking, small-scale fixed location tagging, or streamside/backcountry marking.

PIT tags come in various sizes (e.g., 8.4 mm, 9 mm, 12.5 mm, and 22 mm) to accommodate specific application needs and budget constraints. The appropriate size should be chosen based on the fish species and tagging objectives.

4. Target: Efficient and accurate marking of salmonids using PIT tags for individual identification and tracking in various aquatic environments.
5. Constraints: Factors such as tag size, cost, compatibility with existing systems, availability of specialized personnel, and the need for customized software solutions may pose constraints when implementing PIT tagging methods. Additionally, considerations should be given to potential impacts on fish welfare during handling and anesthesia procedures.
