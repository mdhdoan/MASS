2. Abstract: This method, derived from the EMAP protocol, is a comprehensive guide for monitoring western wadable streams' environmental health. It focuses on evaluating stream substrate size and embeddedness at cross-sectional transects. The measurement of various physical dimensions, such as wetted width and water depth, provides valuable insights into the impact of human activities on the stream ecosystem. This method helps environmental professionals make informed decisions to protect and conserve streams effectively.

3. Description: The method is based on an EMAP protocol for monitoring western wadable streams, focusing on measuring stream substrate size and embeddedness at cross-sectional transects. Substrate size significantly influences fish and macroinvertebrate habitats, as it impacts hydraulic roughness, water velocities, and available living space. The method combines techniques from various sources, including Wolman (1954), Bain et al. (1985), Platts et al. (1983), and Plafkin et al. (1989).

Substrate size is evaluated at 21 cross-section transects using a systematic selection of five particles per transect. The wetted width, water depth, and other physical dimensions are recorded during the measurement process. For cross-sections split by mid-channel bars or entirely dry, specific guidelines ensure accurate and consistent measurements.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a standardized procedure for assessing and monitoring the environmental health of western wadable streams, with an emphasis on evaluating substrate size as an indicator of human impact.
5. Constraints: The success of this method relies on proper execution and adherence to guidelines, which may require specialized knowledge, tools, or training in stream ecology and physical measurement techniques. Additionally, environmental conditions (e.g., weather, water levels) might affect data collection and should be taken into account for accurate assessments.
