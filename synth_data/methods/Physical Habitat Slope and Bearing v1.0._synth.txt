2. Abstract: This text describes a method for evaluating stream reaches using the slope or gradient of the channel. The overall gradient is used to classify streams and predict water velocities and sediment transport. Spatial variability of gradient measures habitat complexity, while detailed measurements using the gradient can calculate residual pool depths and volumes. Additionally, slope is combined with other factors to estimate bed stability and sinuosity of the channel.
3. Description: The slope of a stream reach has four main uses in this method. Firstly, it is one of the primary variables for classifying streams, as it can indicate potential water velocities and stream power. Secondly, the spatial variability of stream gradient serves as a measure of habitat complexity, reflecting diversity of water velocities and sediment sizes. Thirdly, detailed measurements using the water surface slope along with depth and width measurements taken in the thalweg profile enable calculation of residual pool depths, volumes, and numbers. Lastly, slope combined with channel dimensions, wood, and substrate particle size is used to estimate relative bed stability. Channel sinuosity can be estimated using compass bearings between cross-section transects and the distance between them.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is evaluating stream reaches using slope as a key variable for various aspects such as classification, habitat complexity, residual pool calculation, bed stability estimation, and sinuosity measurement.
5. Constraints: This method requires detailed measurements including depth, width, and substrate particle size, along with the use of specific methods from Stack (1989), Robison and Kaufmann (1994), and Kaufmann et al. (1999). Additionally, calculating sinuosity necessitates compass bearings between cross-section transects and distance measurements.
