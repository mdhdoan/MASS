 Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the keywords I have identified from the text body:

1. River Bathymetry Toolkit (RBT)
2. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of stream reaches
3. Geomorphology and aquatic habitat analyses
4. ArcGIS tools
5. DEM processing and analysis

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract:
The River Bathymetry Toolkit (RBT) is a suite of GIS tools developed by ESSA Technologies for processing high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of stream reaches. The RBT aims to characterize in-stream and floodplain geomorphology to support aquatic habitat analyses and numerical models of flow and sediment transport. It includes various tools to conduct different types of DEM-associated analyses, such as geomorphic change detection, uncertainty analyses, user-defined density of cross-sections, and longitudinal profiles. These tools can extract hydrologic parameters, detect erosion and depositional patterns and budgets, and estimate the uncertainty in the DEM. Additionally, the RBT uses an automated detrending algorithm to remove overall valley slope and help users investigate flooding outside a main channel at any prescribed discharge or flow stage.

3. Description:
The River Bathymetry Toolkit (RBT) is a set of GIS tools created for ArcGIS that are used for processing high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of stream reaches. The RBT's goal is to characterize in-stream and floodplain geomorphology to support aquatic habitat analyses and numerical models of flow and sediment transport.

The tools included in the RBT are designed for various types of DEM analysis, including:

* Geomorphic change detection
* Uncertainty analyses
* User-defined density of cross-sections and longitudinal profiles

These tools can extract hydrologic parameters such as wetted area, bankfull width, water depths, hydraulic radius, gradient, sinuosity (McKean et al. 2009), erosion, depositional patterns and budgets, and uncertainty in the DEM (Wheaton et al. 2010).

The RBT uses an automated detrending algorithm to remove the overall valley slope, enabling the investigation of flooding outside a main channel at any prescribed discharge or flow stage. The RBT also allows users to recreate other survey protocols that use cross-sectional and longitudinal profile approaches.

The CHaMP - Topographic Point Collection Methods (Method ID:5328) provides background on the collection of X, Y, Z point measurement data used to generate the DEM that is analyzed for this calculation.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the RBT is to provide a suite of GIS tools for processing high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of stream reaches, enabling accurate characterization of in-stream and floodplain geomorphology to support aquatic habitat analyses and numerical models of flow and sediment transport.
5. Constraints:
The RBT is currently available for free but is being actively developed by ESSA Technologies. The tools are designed for use with ArcGIS, which may limit accessibility for some users. Additionally, the accuracy of the analysis depends on the quality of the DEM used as input data.
