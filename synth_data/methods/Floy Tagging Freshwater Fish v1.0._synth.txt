2. Abstract: Floy tags are a crucial method for short-term mark and recapture studies, primarily employed for fish species like steelhead or rainbow trout (Persons et al. 2013). These tags have several advantages such as easy application, durability, high retention rates, and minimal impact on survival, growth, or behavior (McFarlane et al. 1990; Mourning et al. 1994). Floy tags are often complemented by fin clipping to aid in identifying recaptured fish that may have lost their tags (Persons et al. 2013).
3. Description: Floy tags, utilized mainly for mark and recapture studies, are an essential tool for monitoring and studying fish populations. These specialized tags consist of an external component with internal attachment, making them easy to apply while ensuring high retention rates. Desirable characteristics include ease of visibility, minimal effect on survival, growth, or behavior (McFarlane et al. 1990; Mourning et al. 1994). For accurate identification, fin clipping is often used in conjunction with Floy tags to help recognize recaptured fish that may have lost their tags during the study period (Persons et al. 2013).
4. Target: The primary focus of Floy tags is enhancing data collection and analysis for short-term mark and recapture studies, specifically for fish species like steelhead or rainbow trout.
5. Constraints: Potential constraints for Floy tag use include limited visibility under certain conditions, possible adverse effects on behavior due to tag presence, and occasional difficulties in retaining tags despite the high retention rates reported in studies (McFarlane et al. 1990; Mourning et al. 1994; Persons et al. 2013).
