2. Abstract: This method outlines the importance of collecting individual fry weights at hatcheries and field sampling sites, such as migrant traps and seining. Due to the small size of fry, special care must be taken during the weighing process to avoid bias caused by water on the fry. Accurate measurement of fry weight is crucial for monitoring fish populations and managing hatchery operations.
3. Description: The text describes a method for collecting and measuring the weight of individual fry at hatcheries and field sampling sites. Fry weights are an important indicator of fish population health and are used in hatchery management and conservation efforts. However, due to their small size, fry weights can easily be affected by water on the fry, leading to bias and inaccurate measurements. Therefore, it is necessary to exercise extra care when handling and weighing fry to ensure accurate results.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a standardized procedure for collecting and measuring individual fry weights at hatcheries and field sampling sites.
5. Constraints: The main constraint of this method is the small size of fry, which makes them difficult to handle and weigh accurately. Care must be taken to avoid bias caused by water on the fry during the weighing process.
