  "background": "Significant investments have been made to monitor anadromous fish populations and restore habitats within the Columbia River Basin in previous decades. Spatially indexed juvenile salmon and steelhead counts and redd counts now exist at hundreds to thousands of stream sites throughout the region. In addition to answering status and trend questions that originally motivated collection of those datasets, they can often be integrated and used with new spatial-stream-network (SSN) models to understand the effects of habitat conditions and to make predictions of fish abundance and distributions at unsampled site throughout full river networks. The SSN models differ from previous models in that they do not require spatially independent samples but instead benefit from some degree of non-independence among samples in close proximity. This provides an incentive to aggregate large samples from multiple sources because the models become increasingly accurate as the amount of data and clustering in the dataset increase. The SSN models describe the spatial decay in patterns of non-independence and use it with fixed effect parameter estimates for habitat factors to make accurate spatial predictions of fish abundance. Because the SSN models are spatially explicit, their integration with geospatial stream hydrography layers like the National Hydrography Dataset and National Stream Internet network (Nagel et al. 2015) facilitates the development of accurate prediction maps that show patterns in fish distributions. Spatially-explicit estimates of uncertainty may also be developed with those prediction maps, which are useful for allocating subsequent sample collections to those areas that address the greatest uncertainties. The rationale for this project is to develop the means of applying SSNs in a computationally efficient manner to anadromous fish datasets and the creation of a Fish Data Analysis Tool (FDAT) that enables visualization of results through an online data portal.",

  "id": 3336,
  "assumptions": "<p>Key assumptions for FDAT are: 1) sufficient numbers of juvenile anadromous fish density samples or redd counts exist within a river basin to show evidence of spatial autocorrelation, 2) the fish data can be assembled into a properly formatted dataset for use with the SSN and STARS software, 3) patterns in fish abundance will be related to available geospatial representations of stream habitat conditions, and 4) steps associated with fitting SSN models and linking fish data to geospatial habitat descriptors can be semi-automated. Once a functional FDAT prototype exists, it could be linked to a regional fish database to enable efficient modeling and mapping of patterns in anadromous fish density.</p>\r\n",
  "objectives": [
    "1) Organize and summarize an anadromous fish density dataset for a pilot area, 2) link fish densities to habitat variables, 3) fit SSN model and map predictions, 4) deliver results online through FDAT"
