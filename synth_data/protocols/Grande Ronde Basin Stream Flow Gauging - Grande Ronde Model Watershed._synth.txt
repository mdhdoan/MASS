 1. Abstract: This protocol focuses on standardized stream-gaging procedures, providing a comprehensive description and acting as a training guide for hydraulic engineers and technicians, particularly those in the U.S. Geological Survey. The aim is to offer a solution for proper data collection, analysis, and dissemination of streamflow records used in various applications, from water supply planning to hydroelectric power generation.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes:
 values: Importance of accurate and reliable streamflow records
 problem statement: The need for standardized procedures for stream-gaging
 desired outcomes: Proper training for hydraulic engineers and technicians in collecting, computing, and publishing stream-gaging data.
3. Description: This text describes state-of-the-art standardized stream-gaging procedures, focusing on the technical aspects of measuring stage and discharge, calculating the stage-discharge relation, and compiling daily-discharge records. The target audience includes engineers and technicians who require in-depth knowledge about these procedures. The importance of networks of continuous-record stations is emphasized, along with the role of auxiliary networks for specific purposes, such as flood frequency studies or fish and wildlife maintenance efforts.
4. Objectives:
Describe the objective in detail: Standardizing stream-gaging procedures to ensure accurate data collection, analysis, and dissemination.
Summary of Solution Coverage: The entire problem statement is addressed through this standardization protocol.
Keywords: Stream-gaging procedures, standardization, data collection, data analysis, data dissemination, USGS, engineers, technicians.
5. Target: Standardizing stream-gaging procedures for accurate and reliable records.
6. Constraints: The primary constraint is the need for proper training and familiarity with technical terms and methodologies described in this protocol to ensure effective implementation of these standardized procedures.
