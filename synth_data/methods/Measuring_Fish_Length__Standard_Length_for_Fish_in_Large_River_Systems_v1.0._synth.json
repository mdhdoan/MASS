  "abstract": " This method is used to measure the length of fish when they cannot be measured using the maximum total length or fork length methods due to damaged or deformed caudal fins. The standard length is measured from the most forward point of the head (with jaw closed) to the rear end of the fish's body, indicated by the notch created when bending the caudal peduncle. This method is necessary for accurately measuring certain fish species when their caudal fins prevent the use of other methods. By following this procedure, we can ensure consistent and reliable length measurements for a wide range of fish specimens.\n\nNo code provided in this answer."

  "description": " This text describes a specific method for measuring the length of fish specimens when they cannot be measured using the maximum total length or fork length methods due to damaged or deformed caudal fins. The method is referred to as \"Standard Length\" (Method ID: 1551).\n\nThe measurement begins at the anterior-most extreme of the head, specifically the point where the jaw is closed. The measurement then proceeds to the posterior margin of the hypural bone, which is identified by the notch created when the caudal peduncle is flexed. In other words, this method measures from the tip of the snout to the end of the last vertebra in the fish's tail.\n\nIt's important to note that this measurement should only be used as an alternative when it's impossible to measure the fish using the maximum total length or fork length methods. This method is particularly relevant for species where these other methods are not applicable due to damaged or deformed caudal fins.\n\nTherefore, in technical terms, Standard Length (Method ID: 1551) is a measurement of the distance from the tip of the snout (anterior-most extreme of the head with jaw closed) to the posterior margin of the hypural bone (notch created by flexing the caudal peduncle)."

  "constraints": " This text describes a specific method for measuring the length of a fish, referred to as \"standard length.\" The constraints applicable to this method are:\n\n1. The fish specimen cannot be measured using the maximum total length method (Method ID: 1551).\n2. The fish specimen cannot be measured using the fork length method (Method ID: 4041).\n3. The measurement should only be taken if the fish's caudal fins are damaged or deformed, preventing the use of other methods.\n\nThe text explains that standard length should be used as an alternative method when the specimen does not meet the conditions for maximum total length or fork length measurements (lines 2-4). It also provides a visual reference in the form of a fish measurement image (line 1) and cites a source (Anderson and Gutreuter 1983) for further information.\n\nTherefore, the constraints are explicitly stated in lines 2-4 of the text. No code is required to answer this question."
