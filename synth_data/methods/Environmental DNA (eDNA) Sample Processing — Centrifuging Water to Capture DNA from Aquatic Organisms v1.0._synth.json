  "abstract": " The University of Notre Dame developed a new method for detecting invasive species in aquatic systems using Environmental DNA (eDNA). Traditional methods were not effective at detecting invasive species at low densities. eDNA is released into the water through various mechanisms such as shedding of cells and tissue residues. Water samples are collected, and eDNA is extracted from the organic and inorganic matter using a process called whole DNA extraction. The extracted DNA is then analyzed using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays to identify species-specific mitochondrial DNA markers, confirming the presence of the targeted invasive species. This method addresses the limitations of traditional techniques by providing a more sensitive and effective means for early detection and management of invasive species populations in aquatic ecosystems."

  "description": " This text describes a novel approach developed by the University of Notre Dame for detecting invasive species in aquatic systems, utilizing environmental DNA (eDNA). Traditional fishery techniques were previously employed to identify the frontiers of invasive species populations, yet proved insufficient for targeting these organisms at low densities.\n\neDNA is derived from various sources and mechanisms, including the shedding of external epidermal cells into the water, internal epidermal cells expelled through feces, and tissue residues following injury or predation. The presence of eDNA in water samples is determined via a two-step process: whole DNA extraction from both organic and inorganic matter suspended in the water, followed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays for species-specific mitochondrial DNA markers.\n\nThe initial step involves extracting the total DNA content present within the water sample. This is accomplished through a series of processes that isolate and purify the DNA from the organic and inorganic matter, ensuring an uncontaminated DNA template for subsequent analysis.\n\nFollowing the extraction process, PCR assays are employed to amplify targeted sequences of mitochondrial DNA unique to the invasive species under investigation. The resulting amplicons (amplified DNA products) are then analyzed through various methods such as gel electrophoresis or capillary electrophoresis to confirm the presence and concentration of the target eDNA in the sample.\n\nBy utilizing environmental DNA, this method offers increased sensitivity and efficiency compared to traditional fishery techniques, providing an essential tool for early detection and management of invasive species populations within aquatic ecosystems."

  "constraints": " Based on the provided text, the following constraints related to the eDNA detection method are identified:\n\n1. The method is ineffective at targeting invasive species at low densities using traditional fishery techniques (line 1-3).\n2. The detection of eDNA relies on whole DNA extraction from particulate organic and inorganic matter found in the water (line 8-9).\n3. PCR assays for species-specific mitochondrial DNA markers are used to detect eDNA (line 10-12).\n\nThese constraints are stated explicitly in the text. No additional explanation is required as the information provided is clear and sufficient. Therefore, there's no need to generate any code for this task."
