  "abstractText": "Hydrodynamic modeling may be a key activity to determining a preferred water managemnt action intended to reduce recruitment of nan-native fish predators.The hydrodynamic modeling will occur in multiple stages, with subsequent stages providing necessary data to inform the next. The four stages are threshold setting, 2-D scenario modeling, 2-D model validation, and fall Chinook salmonstrandingand entrapment risk assessment. The fourth stage uses the same methods as the first stage, thus only one method is provided for this activity.",
