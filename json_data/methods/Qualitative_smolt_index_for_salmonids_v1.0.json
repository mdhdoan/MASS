  "abstractText": "This method provides a simple classification of for state smoltification in juvenile anadromous salmonids based on visual characteristics. Physiological processes in juvenile anadromous salmonids undergoing smoltification cause changes in the physical external appearance of the fish. Changes in coloration are assessed with a 3 point scale. The process is subjective and assessment is improved when conducted by personnel experienced in the life history of juvenile anadromous salmonids and the changes in their coloration at smoltification.",
