2. Abstract: The method described involves a nonlethal approach for collecting fish samples through fin clipping. This technique aims to minimize impact on vulnerable wild and natural populations. Hatchery and field sampling methods are discussed, with specific attention given to the handling of steelhead specimens in collaboration with local biologists. Field collections involve the use of seine nets and single-pass electrofishing, ensuring careful monitoring and analysis of samples prior to release.

3. Description: The methodology focuses on nonlethal fin clips as a means to collect samples from wild and natural fish populations, mitigating damage to at-risk species. Hatchery samples are collected from parr or presmolts shortly before their scheduled release into the environment. Field sampling targets parr or smolts in various contexts, with additional care taken when dealing with steelhead specimens. Collaboration with local biologists is emphasized to ensure accurate identification and handling of resident rainbow trout, except for those targeted in parentage analysis research. Collection methods include seine nets and single-pass electrofishing, both of which are chosen to reduce any adverse effects on fish populations during sample gathering.

4. Target: The primary focus of the method is minimizing impact on at-risk wild and natural fish populations while collecting necessary data through nonlethal fin clipping.

5. Constraints: The method is subject to certain constraints, including the need for close collaboration with local biologists, particularly in the identification and handling of steelhead specimens. Additionally, collection methods must be carefully chosen to minimize adverse effects on fish populations during sample gathering (i.e., seine nets and single-pass electrofishing).
