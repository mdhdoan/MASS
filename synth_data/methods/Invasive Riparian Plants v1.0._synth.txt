2. Abstract: This method is derived from an Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) protocol for monitoring western wadable streams. The issue of increasing concern is the invasion of nonnative tree, shrub, and grass species along these streams. These invasions alter stream ecosystems and negatively impact land value. Riparian areas are particularly susceptible to invasions due to natural and human-induced disturbances. This method establishes vegetation plots to examine riparian areas for the presence of twelve selected invasive plant species, providing insight into the extent and severity of invasions in different aquatic systems across the western U.S.
3. Description: The method described is based on an EMAP protocol developed for monitoring western wadable streams and focuses on identifying and assessing the invasion of nonnative plant species in riparian areas. Invasive plants can significantly alter stream ecosystems and reduce land value. Riparian areas are prone to invasions due to natural and human-induced disturbances, and determining the extent and severity of these invasions helps understand the differences between minimally disturbed and least disturbed aquatic systems in the western U.S. Twelve species have been selected as target species, with specific combinations for each state (Table 8-1).
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to identify and assess the presence and impact of invasive plant species in riparian areas along western wadable streams in the U.S.
5. Constraints: This method's constraints include the necessity for detailed knowledge of target species, understanding local and regional ecological conditions, accessibility to riparian areas for vegetation plot setup, and potential limitations due to seasonal or environmental factors affecting plant growth and visibility.
