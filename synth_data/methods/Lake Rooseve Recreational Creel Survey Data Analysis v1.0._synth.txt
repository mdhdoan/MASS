2. Abstract: Creel surveys on Lake Roosevelt provide valuable data for estimating angler pressure, harvest, catch rates, and economic value of the fishery. To ensure accurate and reliable results, statistical analysis was conducted using the R 3.5.2 programming language in collaboration with a biostatistician. This method allows for transparent, reproducible, and rigorous analysis of creel survey data, addressing the challenge of accurately estimating key fishery metrics.
3. Description: The text describes the use of creel surveys on Lake Roosevelt to collect data for estimating annual angler pressure, harvest, catch rates, and economic value of the fishery. Statistical analysis was performed using R 3.5.2 programming language, a powerful tool for statistical computing and graphics. The analysis was developed in coordination with a biostatistician, ensuring appropriate statistical techniques were applied to the data. This approach allows for transparent and reproducible research, addressing concerns around the validity and reliability of fishery assessments.
4. Target: Accurate estimation and analysis of creel survey data for Lake Roosevelt fishery management.
5. Constraints: The success of this method relies on the quality and accuracy of creel survey data collection, as well as the availability of a qualified biostatistician to collaborate on the statistical analysis. Additionally, the use of R 3.5.2 may require users to have a certain level of programming proficiency, potentially limiting its accessibility for some fishery managers or researchers.
