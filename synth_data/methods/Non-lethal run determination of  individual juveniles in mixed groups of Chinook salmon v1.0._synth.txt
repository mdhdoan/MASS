 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are five relevant keywords related to the method used in the text body:

1. DNA markers
2. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) products
3. Genetic marker (OT-38)
4. Chinook salmon juveniles
5. Columbia and Snake River basins

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract:
The necessity for a nonlethal diagnostic method to study Chinook salmon runs is complicated by the coexistence of fall, spring, and summer run juveniles in river systems. In response to this challenge, Rasmussen et al. (2003) developed DNA markers using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) products. The researchers identified a genetic marker (OT-38) that can discriminate between the major Chinook salmon runs in the Columbia and Snake River basins. This method is nonlethal, has less stringent storage requirements, and potentially higher resolution than allozymes, making it an effective tool for field studies.

3. Description:
The text body discusses the development of DNA markers by Rasmussen et al. (2003) to discriminate between Chinook salmon runs in the Columbia and Snake River basins. The researchers used randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) products to identify a genetic marker (OT-38) that can differentiate between the major Chinook salmon runs. This method is nonlethal, which is crucial for field studies as it allows for the collection of data without harming the fish. Additionally, DNA markers have less stringent storage requirements and potentially higher resolution than allozymes.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to develop a nonlethal diagnostic tool that can discriminate between Chinook salmon runs in river systems where fall, spring, and summer run juveniles coexist.

5. Constraints:
One constraint for this method could be the availability of resources, such as funding and equipment, needed to conduct genetic testing. Additionally, there may be limitations related to the accuracy and reliability of DNA markers in certain environments or populations of Chinook salmon. It is also important to note that while DNA markers can provide valuable information about the genetic makeup of individual fish, they do not necessarily reflect other factors that may influence run timing and migration patterns, such as temperature, water flow, and food availability.
