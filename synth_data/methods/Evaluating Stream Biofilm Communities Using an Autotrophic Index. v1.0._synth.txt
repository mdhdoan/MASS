2. Abstract: This method proposes to measure and analyze the composition and trophic nature of stream biofilm communities, which are crucial for freshwater food webs. By examining key metrics such as chlorophyll a, ash-free dry mass, and C and N stable isotopes from natural substrata, researchers can calculate the autotrophic index to evaluate the community's trophic status. These measurements will enhance understanding of stream ecosystems and their roles in broader aquatic environments.
3. Description: The method aims to investigate stream biofilm communities by measuring chlorophyll a and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) from natural substrata using standard laboratory methods. Chlorophyll a, a pigment involved in photosynthesis, reflects the autotrophic production dominated by photosynthetic algae. AFDM represents organic matter excluding inorganic material after ignition. Moreover, C and N stable isotope ratios will be analyzed to understand the community's nutrient sources and trophic relationships. The autotrophic index (AI) will then be calculated using AFDM and chlorophyll a values with the formula AI = (AFDM (mg m-2) / Chlorophyll a (mg m-2)). This AI helps evaluate the trophic nature of stream biofilm communities.
4. Target: The primary focus is to analyze and evaluate the trophic status and nutrient sources of stream biofilm communities through various measurements and calculations.
5. Constraints: To successfully implement this method, researchers need access to suitable freshwater streams with abundant biofilm communities, appropriate laboratory facilities for sample analysis, and a solid understanding of the relevant ecological concepts and calculation methods. Time and financial resources are also necessary considerations for comprehensive data collection and analysis.
