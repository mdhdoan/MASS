 1. Abstract: This text describes a study on predation of subyearling fall Chinook salmon in the lower Snake River reservoirs, where hatchery supplementation and increased natural production have led to higher abundances of subyearlings. The study aims to estimate the annual loss of subyearlings to smallmouth bass predation in the upper portion of Lower Granite Reservoir and document the relative consumption of subyearlings by channel catfish.
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes: The value of this research lies in understanding the impact of non-native predators on the Chinook salmon population, which is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and preserving a valuable natural resource. The problem statement involves determining whether increased subyearling abundance has resulted in higher predation rates by smallmouth bass and channel catfish. The desired outcome is to accurately estimate the loss of subyearlings due to smallmouth bass predation, as well as documenting the relative consumption of subyearlings by channel catfish.
3. Description: The text discusses various aspects of the study design, including methods for collecting and analyzing data on predator populations. It highlights the need to ensure that sampled predators are representative of the population at large and that any bias between different collection methods can be accounted for. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of marking and recapturing a sufficient number of smallmouth bass to estimate their abundance accurately, as well as expanding these estimates to cover the larger study area.
4. Objectives: The main objective is to estimate the annual loss of subyearlings due to smallmouth bass predation in the upper portion of Lower Granite Reservoir and document the relative consumption of subyearlings by channel catfish. This objective covers a significant portion of the problem statement, which focuses on understanding the impact of increased subyearling abundance on predation rates by non-native species.
