 1. Abstract: This protocol aims to evaluate trends in the timing and extent of spawning by Kootenai River white sturgeon, addressing concerns about potential changes to spawning locations or reproductive success due to proposed habitat modifications (Habitat Master Plan no. wt141243). The study utilizes substrate mats at suspected spawning sites and monitors egg development throughout the season.

2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: 
   - Value: Importance of preserving and understanding the reproductive behavior of Kootenai River white sturgeon.
   - Problem Statement: Identifying whether modifications to physical habitats will impact spawning locations, timing, and reproductive success.
   - Desired Outcome: A clear understanding of how potential habitat changes may affect Kootenai River white sturgeon populations and their reproduction.

3. Description: This protocol has been in use since 1996 by Paragamian for evaluating spawning events in the Kootenai River. The study uses substrate mats placed at suspected spawning sites to monitor egg development throughout the season. Monitoring and evaluating reproductive trends will help identify any potential impacts from proposed habitat modifications (Habitat Master Plan no. wt141243).

4. Objectives:
   - Objective: Evaluate changes in the timing, location, and success of Kootenai River white sturgeon spawning due to proposed habitat modifications.
   - Summary of Solution Coverage: This objective focuses on understanding how potential habit changes will impact the reproductive behavior and success of Kootenai River white sturgeon populations.
   - Keywords: Kootenai River, white sturgeon, spawning trends, habitat modifications, Habitat Master Plan no. wt141243.

5. Target: Evaluation of the impact of proposed habitat changes on Kootenai River white sturgeon spawning behavior and success.

6. Constraints: River scale sampling issues may obscure results, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions about the effects of habitat modifications.
