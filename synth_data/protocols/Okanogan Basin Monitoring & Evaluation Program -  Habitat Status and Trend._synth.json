  "abstract": " The OBMEP (Okanogan Basin Monitoring and Evaluation Program) is a long-term initiative that gathers data on the habitat conditions of salmonids during their freshwater stages. This program was developed based on the Monitoring Strategy for the Upper Columbia Basin (2004), aligning with other regional and basin-wide projects such as CSMEP, PNAMP, and EMAP. The methodology ensures compatibility with these initiatives by coordinating with various disciplines and agencies within the Okanogan River Basin, Columbia Cascade Province, and Columbia River Basin.\n\nThe program selects sites using a scientifically rigorous approach, called GRTS (Geographic Reference System), to monitor changes in physical habitat, water quality, and biota over time. This method is crucial since it provides essential information on the health and wellbeing of salmonid populations, enabling effective conservation strategies and adaptive management. By monitoring sites below anadromous barriers, we can assess how well these habitats support the growth and survival of salmonids throughout their life cycles."

  "problem_statement": " The problem the protocol is trying to solve is monitoring and tracking the status and trends of physical habitat for salmonids (specifically anadromous species) below barriers to understand changes over time. This information is essential for effective conservation and management efforts in the Okanogan River Basin, Columbia Cascade Province, and Columbia River Basin."

  "desired_outcomes": " The text discusses OBMEP (Okanogan Basin Monitoring and Evaluation Program), a long-term monitoring program for assessing habitat conditions of salmonids in their freshwater life stages. The methods used are compatible with various regional and basin-wide projects. Sites are selected using the GRTS (Geographic Response Modeling and Targeted Sampling) approach, which can measure changes over time when taken scientifically rigorously.\n\nDesired outcome: Measure changes in the physical habitat status and trends below anadromous barriers for salmonids."

  "description": " The OBMEP (Okanogan-Boundary Monitoring and Evaluation Program) is a long-term status and trends monitoring program designed to assess habitat conditions for salmonids during their freshwater life stages. The program's Habitat Monitoring methods were established according to the Upper Columbia Basin Monitoring Strategy (2004) by Tracy Hillman, and have been aligned with the methods of CSMEP (Collaborative Systemwide Monitoring & Evaluation Program), PNAMP (Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Partnership), and initially implemented following EMAP (Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program). In order to ensure compatibility with other regional and basin-wide initiatives, OBMEP collaborates closely with various disciplines and agencies across the Okanogan River Basin, Columbia Cascade Province, and Columbia River Basin.\n\nThe GRTS (Geographic Resource of Trends and Status) approach is used to select sites for monitoring. These sites can provide valuable information on changes in the status and trends of habitat, water quality, and biota over time if collected according to scientifically rigorous protocols. Specifically, within the context of OBMEP, efforts focus on monitoring the physical habitat of salmonids below anadromous barriers (i.e., structures that prevent fish from migrating upstream). By closely adhering to established monitoring strategies and employing standardized methods for data collection, OBMEP aims to contribute meaningful insights into the health and well-being of salmonid populations within their freshwater habitats."
