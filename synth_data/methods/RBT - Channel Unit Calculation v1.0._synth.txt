2. Abstract: The RBT is a suite of GIS tools designed to work within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software, specifically aimed at describing and measuring river channels using high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). These DEMs can be obtained from airborne remote sensing techniques like LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys. The RBT offers a variety of features to analyze river channels, such as detrending a DEM to remove valley slope, cutting user-defined cross sections, defining hydraulic geometry in each cross section, computing stream gradient and sinuosity, mapping longitudinal variations, changing water levels in a detrended DEM, locating residual pools, and identifying fish habitats.

3. Description: The RBT is an ArcGIS extension that requires the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software to function. Its primary purpose is to provide detailed analysis of river channels using high resolution DEMs. It can derive DEMs from airborne remote sensing techniques like LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys. Users can detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope and cut user-defined cross sections through it. Hydraulic geometry can be defined in each cross section, enabling computation of stream gradient and sinuosity. Long profiles down the length of a channel can be mapped to visualize longitudinal variations in channel geometry metrics. By varying the water level in a detrended DEM, users can investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. Residual pools can also be located, which may help identify fish habitats.

4. Target: The RBT's primary focus is to provide detailed analysis of river channels using high resolution DEMs within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software environment.

5. Constraints: The main constraint for this method is that it requires the installation and use of the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software, as it is an extension for this software.
