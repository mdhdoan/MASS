  "background": "A primary objective of the Chief Joseph Kokanee Enhancement Project (CJKEP) is to identify and address factors limiting naturally produced kokanee salmon. The Sanpoil River, tributary to the Columbia River in Lake Roosevelt, has been selected by the project for kokanee restoration and enhancement. Water quality and habitat surveys conducted in the Sanpoil River drainage in 2009-10 found areas that had conditions indicative of high quality kokanee spawning. Model results suggested the Sanpoil River could support a spawning escapement of 238,464 to 1,703,315 kokanee. The project began utilizing egg and and yearling plants in the Sanpoil River as a means to establish kokanee runs. The project plans to implement an egg to fry survival study to estimate survival during the period prior to out-migration. The objectives will be to determine egg to alevin survival during the intra gravel burial, monitor developmental stages, emergence times, alevin and juvenile sizes, and outmigration timing. The project will correlate developmental parameters with physical parameters (dissolved oxygen, temperature, and fine sediments)",
