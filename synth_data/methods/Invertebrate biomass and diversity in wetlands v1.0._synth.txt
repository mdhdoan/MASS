2. Abstract: This study focuses on the impact of fish presence in wetlands on invertebrate populations and waterfowl production. The research is primarily conducted in the prairie pothole region of North America, which is crucial for duck breeding, and the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project (CBIP) areas. Historically, fish-free wetlands have shown higher waterfowl productivity due to abundant invertebrate communities. However, recent studies indicate a decline in waterfowl productivity and wetland diversity within the CBIP, partly attributed to fish presence. The study tests the hypothesis that invertebrate abundance differs between fish-present and fish-absent ponds in the CBIP area.
3. Description: The investigation on the effects of fish on invertebrate populations and waterfowl production in wetlands has been ongoing for decades, with a particular focus on the prairie pothole region in North America. This region is known for its high duck production, accounting for 50% of annual duck production on the continent and hosting 20 out of 34 species of ducks that breed in North America (Smith et al. 1964; Batt et al. 1989). Much of the region's importance comes from the high biomass and secondary productivity of macroinvertebrates in prairie potholes (Bataille and Baldassarre 1993).

The Columbia Basin Irrigation Project (CBIP) has created attractive wetland habitat for breeding ducks, with a significant increase in breeding duck pairs after the project's completion (Foster and Myers 1984). In 1985, when weighted breeding population indices were around 200,000, the wasteway stratum primarily in the Desert unit of the Wildlife Area supported 77 breeding duck pairs/km2, comparable to densities in the prairie pothole region (M. Monda, WDFW, unpublished data, Giudice et al. 2000). However, waterfowl productivity and wetland diversity within the Columbia Basin have consistently declined in recent years (Columbia Basin Wildlife Area Wetland Management Plan, WDFW, 2006).

Fish are believed to be responsible for this decline due to their adverse effects on vegetative and invertebrate communities. Fish presence significantly alters the composition and abundance of invertebrate communities (Batzer et al. 2000; Zimmer et al. 2001) and typically reduces invertebrate availability to waterfowl (Bendell and McNicol 1995; Bouffard and Hanson 1997). Most wetlands within the CBIP are currently inhabited by fish, but there are a few isolated fish-free wetlands and potential rehabilitation candidates. The study tests the hypothesis that relative invertebrate abundance differs between ponds with and without fish in the CBIP area.

4. Target: Investigating the relationship between fish presence and invertebrate abundance in wetlands, specifically within the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project area.
5. Constraints: The study is limited to the available data from the prairie pothole region and the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project areas. Additionally, the focus on invertebrate communities may overlook other potential factors affecting waterfowl productivity and wetland diversity within the CBIP.
