2. Abstract: The Total Spawner Abundance (TSA) is a crucial metric in the Natural Origin Spawner Abundance indicator calculation. This method, defined in Galbraithe et al. 2008, plays a significant role in assessing and understanding marine populations' health and productivity. By calculating TSA, scientists can evaluate the status of a species and its ecosystem's overall well-being, ultimately guiding conservation and management efforts.

3. Description: The Total Spawner Abundance (TSA) is an essential metric in the Natural Origin Spawner Abundance indicator calculation, as stated in Galbraithe et al. 2008. TSA is a quantifiable measure used to determine the abundance of spawners, which are sexually mature fish taking part in reproduction. The TSA serves as an essential input for calculating Natural Origin Spawner Abundance, which estimates the number of fish generated through natural reproduction while considering various life stages and mortality factors. This methodology provides a comprehensive assessment of marine populations' health and productivity, informing conservation and management strategies to protect these valuable resources.

4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to estimate Total Spawner Abundance (TSA) as an essential input for calculating Natural Origin Spawner Abundance indicators. This information is vital for evaluating the health and productivity of marine populations and their ecosystems, informing conservation and management efforts.

5. Constraints: The calculation of TSA relies on accurate data collection, including life stage identification and mortality factors. Ensuring precise and comprehensive data collection can be challenging, as it requires extensive resources and expertise. Additionally, environmental variability may affect fish populations, making it essential to consider these fluctuations when interpreting TSA results.
