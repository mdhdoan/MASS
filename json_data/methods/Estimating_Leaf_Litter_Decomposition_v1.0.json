  "abstractText": "Leaf litter is an important source of energy/nutrients to freshwater ecosystems. Leaf litter decomposition rates have been used as indicators of ecosystem heath. The biotic community (fungal, microbial, and macroinvertebrates) perfom the function of leaf litter decomposition, which is also influenced by abiotic factors such as temperature. Leaf breakdown is potentially an ideal measure because it links the characteristics of riparian vegetation with the activity of aquatic invertebrates and microbial organisms (Young et al. 2008)",
