2. Abstract: The text describes a method for ensuring the safety of fish and staff in an aquatic environment, specifically by monitoring and controlling water velocity and trap depth. Excessive water velocity can put fish and equipment at risk, so it is important to maintain an average operating river velocity that does not exceed 3.5 ft/sec and is lower than the velocity at the trap entrance.
3. Description: The method outlined in the text involves monitoring water conditions, with a focus on water velocity and trap depth, to ensure the safety of fish, staff, and equipment in an aquatic environment. The maximum average operating river velocity is set at 3.5 ft/sec, and this velocity must be lower than the velocity at the trap entrance to prevent harm to the fish. This ensures that the fish are able to safely navigate the trap and avoid being injured or killed by excessive water velocity.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to ensure the safety of fish and staff in an aquatic environment by controlling water velocity and trap depth.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need to maintain an average operating river velocity that does not exceed 3.5 ft/sec, and ensuring that this velocity is lower than the velocity at the trap entrance. These constraints are necessary to protect the safety of the fish and equipment in the aquatic environment.
