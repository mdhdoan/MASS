 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the labels and explanations you requested:

1. Keywords: otoliths, fish preparation, epoxy mounting, sectioning, ageing
2. Abstract: This method describes the process of preparing otoliths from fish for ageing. After removing otoliths from fish, they need to be prepared before they can be read. The chosen method involves mounting the otoliths in epoxy and sectioning them, which is effective for clouded otoliths or those from older fish. This approach allows researchers to study the age of fish species accurately.
3. Description: The text details a method for preparing otoliths from fish for ageing. After removing otoliths from fish, they need some preparation before they are ready to read. The chosen method involves mounting the otoliths in epoxy and sectioning them, which is effective for clouded otoliths or those from older fish. This process ensures that the otoliths are properly prepared for ageing, allowing researchers to study the age of fish species accurately.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to prepare otoliths from fish for ageing.
5. Constraints: One constraint of this method is that it may not be effective for all fish species, as the best option to prepare otoliths varies by species. However, mounting the otoliths in epoxy and sectioning them has been found to be effective for clouded otoliths or those from older fish.
