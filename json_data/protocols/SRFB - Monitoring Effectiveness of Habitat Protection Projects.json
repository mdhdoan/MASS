Following are SRFB Objectives for protecting property for salmon recovery through purchases or easements.  1. Protect identified blocks of critical habitat within the ESU, which protect the species at risk from further decline (a conservation area identified for conservancy  a refugia).  2. Protect property providing key linkages connecting fragmented habitats (a parcel that contributes to maintaining key ecological processes).  3. Protect property used to enhance habitat and to offset poor habitat elsewhere in the watershed (habitat enhancement/restoration).",
