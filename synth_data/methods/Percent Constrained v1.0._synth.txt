2. Abstract:
This method introduces a technique for measuring the percentage of monitoring reach that is constrained, based on the 'Measuring channel constraints v1.0' (ID: 239). The approach focuses on quantifying all constraining features in contact with the stream channel, providing valuable insights for environmental management and assessment.

3. Description:
This methodology, as described in 'Measuring channel constraints v1.0' (ID: 239), measures a monitoring reach to determine the percentage of its length that is constrained by surrounding features. Constraining features refer to elements that are in direct contact with the stream channel, affecting its flow and characteristics. This methodology aims to provide an accurate assessment of the spatial constraints within a given monitoring reach, offering essential data for environmental analysis and decision-making processes.

4. Target:
The primary goal of this method is to quantify and report the percentage of a monitoring reach that experiences channel constraint.

5. Constraints:
This method's constraints include the availability and accuracy of data on constraining features in contact with the stream channel, as well as any limitations inherent in the measurement techniques used for quantifying these features within the monitoring reach.
