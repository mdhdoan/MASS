2. Abstract: Macroinvertebrate collection is crucial for studying aquatic ecosystems' health and biodiversity. A standard method to achieve this is utilizing a 2-m beam trawl, which is towed along the river bottom to gather organisms for density calculations. This method provides valuable information about suitable habitats and population abundance trends over time, helping monitor and conserve aquatic life effectively.

3. Description: The text describes a specific method for collecting macroinvertebrates using a 2-m beam trawl. This equipment is towed along the river bottom for a specified distance to collect organisms, which are then used to calculate density by dividing the number of collected organisms by the sampled area. Density information is essential in identifying suitable habitats and monitoring population abundance trends over time. By regularly employing this method, researchers can track changes in aquatic ecosystems and ensure proper management and conservation efforts.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to accurately determine macroinvertebrate density in aquatic systems through standardized sampling.

5. Constraints: The 2-m beam trawl method has some constraints, including limitations on the size and type of organisms collected due to the trawl's mesh size. Additionally, the towing distance and speed may impact collection efficiency, potentially affecting density calculations. Lastly, environmental factors such as river depth, current, and sediment composition can influence sampling results. Therefore, it is essential to control these variables during data collection for accurate and meaningful conclusions.
