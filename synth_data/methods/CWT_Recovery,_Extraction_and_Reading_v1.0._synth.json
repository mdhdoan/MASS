  "abstract": " Coded Wire Tags (CWT) are small tags inserted into the snout of salmonids, particularly Chinook salmon, to track their movements since the 1960s. Originally, these tags were color-banded; now they have evolved into 6-digit numerical codes. Each code carries essential information, such as the tag's origin (agency), brood year, and release location.\n\nThe necessity of CWT lies in their ability to help monitor salmonid populations without the need for external marking. Traditional methods like fin clips can be invasive and may impact fish growth or survival. CWT, being non-invasive, offer a more reliable and less intrusive approach for researchers and fisheries managers to study these species.\n\nWhen a tagged Chinook is recovered, it's scanned with specialized equipment like a T-wand or V-reader. The data gathered from the scan can be accessed in the Radio Tag Monitoring Information System (RMIS), providing insights into the specific fish and its history. The use of CWT significantly advances our understanding of salmonid populations, migration patterns, and stock dynamics.\n\nThere is no code involved in this explanation."

  "description": " Coded wire tags (CWTs) are a long-standing tool for marking salmonids without the need for external markings, first introduced in the 1960s. For Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), these tags are injected into the snout.\n\nThe development of CWTs has progressed significantly over the years. Initially, they were longitudinal banded tags with five distinct colors. Later on, they transformed into binary tags and eventually into 6-digit numerical code tags. The numerical codes generated from these tags offer an increased capacity for producing unique tag codes.\n\nThe 6-digit code embedded in a CWT provides essential information about the spool from which it was extracted. This data includes agency details, brood year, and release location. When a Chinook salmon is recovered, it undergoes assessment using a T-wand or V-reader to detect the presence of a CWT.\n\nThese devices function by scanning the dorsal portion of the fish's head. The tag, once detected, is collected and subsequently analyzed in a laboratory. Magnification techniques are employed during this analysis process for obtaining clear visualizations of the tag details.\n\nRecovered tags are entered into the Regional Management Information System (RMIS) for retrieving specific data related to that spool or batch of fish. This system plays a crucial role in providing valuable insights into the origin, age, and distribution patterns of Chinook salmon populations."

  "constraints": " The text does not explicitly state any specific constraints related to the method described. However, some implicit assumptions and considerations can be identified:\n\n1. Coded wire tags (CWT) are applicable for labeling salmonids, primarily Chinook salmon (O.tshawytscha), as they are injected into the snout of these fish.\n2. The tags have evolved over time from longitudinal banded tags to binary and numerical codes.\n3. Each tag has a unique 6-digit code that corresponds to specific information including agency, brood year, release location, and possibly other fields.\n4. CWTs are magnetized and can be easily detected using equipment like T-wands or V-readers.\n5. Recovered tags need to be assessed by scanning the dorsal portion of a Chinook salmon's head with the specified detection equipment.\n6. The data from recovered tags is entered into RMIS (Regional Management Information System) for further analysis.\n\nNo specific constraints are mentioned in the text, but it implies that proper handling and careful scanning of tagged fish using specialized equipment are essential to successfully retrieve valuable information about the fish's origin."
