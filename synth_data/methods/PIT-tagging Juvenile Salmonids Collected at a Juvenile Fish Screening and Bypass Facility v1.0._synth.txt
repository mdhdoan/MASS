2. Abstract: The use of Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags as a research and management tool in the Columbia River Basin has been prevalent since 1987. PIT-tagging juvenile salmonids at screening and bypass facilities allows for site-specific evaluations, survival and travel time estimates, and determination of fish usage. The advantages of PIT-tags include their small size, individual fish identification, long life expectancy, and simple tagging procedure. Additionally, the automated tag interrogation system enables tracking without physical recapture, making it a valuable tool for fishery management.

3. Description: PIT tags are used in the Columbia River Basin as a research and management tool for juvenile salmonids. They have been utilized since 1987 at juvenile fish screening and bypass facilities to conduct site-specific evaluations, estimate survival and travel time in reaches above and below the facility, and determine the proportion of fish using the facility. PIT-tagging offers several advantages over other marking or tagging methods, such as its small size, individual fish identification, long life expectancy, and relatively simple tagging procedure. The key benefit of PIT-tags is that they do not require physical recapture; instead, they only need to pass by an automated tag interrogation system for tracking.

4. Target: The primary focus of PIT-tagging in the Columbia River Basin is to provide a reliable and efficient method for tracking juvenile salmonids at screening and bypass facilities, enabling managers to make informed decisions regarding fishery management.

5. Constraints: Despite their advantages, PIT-tags have some limitations. The cost of tagging individual fish may be high compared to other marking methods. Additionally, the automated tag interrogation system's infrastructure requires a significant investment in terms of installation and maintenance.
