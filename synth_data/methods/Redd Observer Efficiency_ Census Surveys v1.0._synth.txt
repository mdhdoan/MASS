2. Abstract: This method describes procedures for estimating total redd counts to evaluate observer efficiency in detecting redds. Redd counts are crucial for monitoring salmonid populations, but numerous factors can lead to errors in counting. These include the timing of surveys, redd and spawning habitat characteristics, spawner densities, and surveyor experience. Erroneous counts may hinder important trend identification and impact species management and conservation. This method aims to provide a reliable means of assessing observer efficiency in redd detection by determining best estimates of total redd counts.
3. Description: The necessity for this method arises from the critical role that redd counts play in monitoring salmonid populations, despite potential errors due to various factors affecting detectability. These factors encompass the timing of surveys, redd characteristics (size, age, and substrate composition), spawning habitat characteristics (stream size, water depth and clarity, distance to cover), spawner densities (large number of redds and/or superimposition), and surveyor experience.

The method focuses on evaluating observer efficiency by determining best estimates of total redd counts. It involves identifying the aforementioned factors affecting detectability and implementing procedures that minimize their impact. This enables a more accurate assessment of observer efficiency in detecting redds, ensuring better monitoring of salmonid populations for management and conservation purposes.

1. Target: The primary goal of this method is to describe procedures for determining best estimates of total redd counts to assess observer (naive) efficiency in redd detection.
2. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method include the variability in environmental factors affecting detectability, such as spawning habitat characteristics and weather conditions during surveys. Additionally, surveyor experience and training may also impact the effectiveness of the method.
