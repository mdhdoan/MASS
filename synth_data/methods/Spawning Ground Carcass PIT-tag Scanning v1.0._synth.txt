 1. Keywords: Electronic equipment, spawning ground surveys, PIT-tag detector, salmonid carcass scanning, maintenance, and care.

2. Abstract: The use of electronic equipment in spawning ground and carcass surveys is essential for accurate data collection. This article focuses on the use of a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT)-tag detector and the correct procedure for scanning an adult salmonid carcass. Proper knowledge of this method ensures that surveyors conduct thorough surveys, maintain the equipment correctly, and enhance the functionality of the PIT-tag detector, leading to reliable data collection.

3. Description: The text details the importance of using electronic equipment in spawning ground and carcass surveys and the necessity of understanding the operation and maintenance of such devices. A PIT-tag detector is a device that detects and records the unique identification number stored on PIT tags inserted into adult salmonids during surveys. Proper scanning technique involves placing the detector near the carcass, activating it, and waiting for a response from any PIT tag in the vicinity. Surveyors must ensure the proper care and maintenance of this equipment to guarantee its functionality and reliability.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to instruct surveyors on using PIT-tag detectors and scanning adult salmonid carcasses accurately during spawning ground and carcass surveys.

5. Constraints: Successful application of this method depends on several constraints, including:

* Access to a functioning PIT-tag detector
* Proper placement and activation of the detector near the carcass
* Availability of properly maintained and functioning PIT tags in the salmonid population
* Surveyors' understanding of proper scanning technique and ability to interpret results accurately.
