 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the keywords I've identified from the text body:

1. Substrate size distribution
2. Fast water habitats
3. Gravelometer
4. Particle measurement
5. Embeddedness of cobbles

Now let's move on to the rest of your request:

2. Abstract:
This method outlines a procedure for quantifying the size distribution of substrate in fast-moving water habitats, which is essential for understanding the physical characteristics of these environments. By measuring 21 particles from 10 cross-sections for a total of 210 particles per site, researchers can obtain a representative sample of the substrate composition. In addition, the method includes an estimation of cobble embeddedness and has been updated for 2012 to use a gravelometer to assign particles to size classes and to include a measurement of percent fines surrounding cobbles.
3. Description:
The method involves taking cross-sections of fast water habitats and measuring the size of 21 particles from each section, resulting in a total of 210 particles being measured per site. This allows researchers to quantify the size distribution of substrate in these environments. In 2012, the method was updated to use a gravelometer for assigning particles to size classes instead of taking discrete measurements. Additionally, the updated method includes a measurement of percent fines surrounding cobbles as an estimate of embeddedness.
4. Target:
The primary goal of this method is to quantify the size distribution of substrate in fast water habitats and to estimate cobble embeddedness.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is that it requires access to fast-moving water habitats for collecting samples. Additionally, accurate measurement of particle sizes and percent fines surrounding cobbles may be challenging and require specialized equipment and training.
