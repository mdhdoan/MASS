2. Abstract: Quantitative PCR is a valuable method for detecting the presence of specific species in environmental samples through the use of species-specific primer probe sets targeting small DNA fragments. Researchers Goldberg et al. (2016) and MacDonald and Sarre (2017) have identified critical considerations for developing and validating quantitative PCR assays for eDNA analysis. This text outlines the essential steps to expand upon these considerations, ensuring accurate and reliable results in environmental DNA analyses.
3. Description: The text details the process of using quantitative PCR to detect species-specific DNA in environmental samples. It builds on previous work by Goldberg et al. (2016) and MacDonald and Sarre (2017), who identified critical considerations for developing and validating quantitative PCR assays for eDNA analysis. The text offers a step-by-step guide to implementing these considerations, providing a more detailed and technical focus on the method.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to establish a reliable protocol for detecting and analyzing species DNA in environmental samples using quantitative PCR assays.
5. Constraints: Some constraints for this method include ensuring the specificity of primer probe sets, optimizing PCR conditions, and validating results through appropriate controls and replicates. Additionally, factors such as sample type, DNA degradation, and inhibitors can also affect the accuracy and reliability of eDNA analyses.
