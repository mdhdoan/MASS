  "abstractText": "In order to prevent the spread of fish diseases and invasive species all wading gear is disinfected prior to use at different sites. Items disinfected between trap sites include, but are not limited to, wading boots, wading socks and neoprene pants. A disinfection station is established prior to the start of the field season to wash all gear that may carry fish diseases or invasive species. The station consists of one wash tub containing a disinfectant (Bardac 2250) and another wash tub containing soap and water. All surveyors use the following procedure to wash and disinfect gear.",
