2. Abstract: The Hood River Production Program (HRPP) has been developing annual run forecasts for adult spring Chinook salmon since 2001. These forecasts are crucial for making informed decisions regarding fishery regulations and brood stock collection. Initially, sibling returns were used to estimate incoming runs of the same cohort. However, with the removal of Powerdale dam and changes in jack counts, HRPP biologists and WEST Inc. biometricians developed a new generation of one-season-ahead multiple regression models. These models utilize environmental parameters that influence salmonid survival to predict adult returns. By selecting a few key predictor variables through stepwise regression, the team ensures simplicity, accuracy, and accessibility in their forecasting methodology.

3. Description: The HRPP develops run forecasts for adult spring Chinook salmon using various models since 2001. These forecasts are essential for decision-making processes such as fishery regulations and brood stock collection. Originally, sibling returns (e.g., jacks to estimate 2-salts) were used to predict incoming runs of the same cohort. However, after the Powerdale dam removal, which enabled accurate run reconstruction data collection, an emerging pattern of poor jack count representation of adult returns led to the development of alternative forecast models by HRPP biologists and WEST Inc. biometricians.

These new models are one-season-ahead multiple regression models using environmental parameters recorded in the Hood River Basin, Columbia River, and Pacific Ocean. These parameters are chosen based on their correlation with salmonid survival. Three or four parameters were selected for each model through a stepwise regression method (Neter, et al., 1996). A model-based bootstrap procedure was applied to provide 90% prediction intervals for the forecasts (Hinkley and Davison, 1996).

The predictor variables in these models are biological and environmental factors that influence or cause a response in the target population. For example, snow water equivalent values measured on Mt. Hood can indicate stream flow and temperature conditions affecting juvenile salmon production and survival in the Hood River. When selecting predictor variables, the objective is to use as few variables as possible while maintaining high accuracy and precision. Additionally, the chosen variables must come from consistent, publicly available sources that biologists utilizing the forecast models can access annually.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to create accurate run forecasts for adult spring Chinook salmon using environmental parameters that influence their survival.

5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method include the availability, consistency, and public accessibility of relevant biological and environmental data required as predictor variables in the multiple regression models.
