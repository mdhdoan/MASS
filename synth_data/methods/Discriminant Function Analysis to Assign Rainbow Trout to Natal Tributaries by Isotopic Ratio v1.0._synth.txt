2. Abstract: Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) is a powerful statistical method used to differentiate between two or more groups based on a set of continuous variables. It aims to determine the most effective predictors for category membership and excels in assigning fish to their origin location through isotopic ratio data analysis. The DFA process consists of two main steps: first, testing the significance of discriminant functions via multivariate F tests; second, classifying observations by calculating optimal combinations of variables that provide maximum discrimination between groups. This method's primary focus is to accurately distinguish and categorize samples based on their characteristic features.
3. Description: DFA is a multivariate assignment technique particularly useful in differentiating groupings based on continuous variables, primarily employed for isotopic ratio data analysis. It is widely used for fish origin assignments (Nowling et al., 2011; Gahagan et al., 2012). The DFA process maintains several assumptions such as multivariate normality, homoscedasticity, non-multicollinearity, and independence. It is robust against slight violations of these assumptions.

The method consists of two main steps: significance testing and classification. In the first step, matrices of total variances and covariances along with pooled within-group variances and covariances are compared using multivariate F tests to determine significant differences between groups regarding all variables. Once statistically significant group means are identified, an optimal combination of variables is automatically determined for subsequent functions in descending order of discrimination power. These functions will be independent and non-overlapping, with each picking up the most variation or greatest unexplained variation.

A canonical correlation analysis is then performed to calculate successive functions and their corresponding canonical roots, which facilitates classification from canonical functions. In this step, subjects are assigned to groups based on their highest classification scores. The maximum number of discriminant functions equals the degrees of freedom or the number of variables in the analysis, whichever is smaller.

4. Target: Primary focus - Effectively differentiating and categorizing samples based on their characteristic features and continuous variable data.
5. Constraints: The method relies on certain assumptions that must be considered, although it typically remains robust against slight violations of these assumptions. These include multivariate normality, homoscedasticity, non-multicollinearity, and independence. DFA requires a sufficient sample size with a minimum number of observations per group for reliable results.
