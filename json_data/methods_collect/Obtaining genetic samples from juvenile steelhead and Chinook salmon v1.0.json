  "abstractText": "NOAA recommends that to demonstrate ESU/DPS viability, annual documentation of a variety of biological parameters (including juvenile abundance, age distribution, sex ratio, length, and run timing) is needed at the population, major population grouping, and ESU/DPS level for each listed species (Crawford and Rumsey 2011).  Fin tissue samples are collected from juvenile steelhead and Chinook salmon to allow for Genetic Stock Identification.  Detailed instructions for this method are provided below.",
