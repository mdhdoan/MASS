 Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize and label the key topics and concepts in your text. Here are five keywords that I think are highly relevant to the method described:

1. Nonrecording gages
2. Observation
3. Data reporting
4. Hydrographer visits
5. Types of nonrecording stage gages

Now, let's move on to the abstract, description, target, and constraints:

2. Abstract:
This method describes the use of nonrecording gages for measuring water levels in streams and rivers. The advantages of using nonrecording gages include their low initial cost, but they require a human observer to read the gage twice daily and report their observations to headquarters. To ensure accuracy and reliability, hydrographers visit the observation sites regularly to inspect the record books and check for discrepancies in the observers' readings.
3. Description:
The text provides a detailed description of how nonrecording gages are used to measure water levels in streams and rivers. Nonrecording gages are read twice daily by an observer, who records and reports their observations to headquarters using record books and weekly report cards. The U.S. Geological Survey uses these records to track water levels and identify any problems or difficulties that arise. Hydrographers visit the observation sites regularly to inspect the record books and ensure that the observers are following proper procedures. The text also describes five types of nonrecording stage gages, including staff and wire-weight gages, which are commonly used at nonrecording stations.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide a reliable and accurate way to measure water levels in streams and rivers using nonrecording gages.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is the need for human observers to read the gages twice daily, which can be time-consuming and subject to errors. Additionally, the accuracy of the measurements depends on the conscientiousness of the observers and the regularity of the hydrographer visits. Finally, the use of nonrecording gages may not be suitable for streams and rivers with rapidly changing water levels.
