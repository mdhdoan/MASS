2. Abstract: The River Bankfull Toolkit (RBT) is a suite of GIS tools designed for river channel analysis within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software. Utilizing high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), RBT measures and describes river channels, offering valuable insights into their formation and characteristics. The toolset benefits various users, such as environmental scientists, engineers, and policymakers, by accurately quantifying river channel parameters for better management and conservation strategies.

3. Description: RBT operates within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software, requiring a prior installation of ArcGIS. The toolkit relies on high-resolution DEMs obtained from airborne remote sensing methods like LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys to analyze river channels. RBT provides several functionalities:
	* Detrending DEM removes the longitudinal valley slope, allowing for accurate channel measurements.
	* Custom cross-sections can be created through the DEM.
	* Hydraulic geometry, such as bankfull width and depth, can be defined in each cross-section.
	* Stream gradient and sinuosity calculations are facilitated.
	* Longitudinal variations along a channel can be mapped using long profiles for any of the channel geometry metrics.
	* Water level manipulation in detrended DEMs helps investigate water depth distribution, identifying off-channel habitats connected to the main flow.
	* Residual pools are located and highlighted, assisting in fish habitat identification.

4. Target: The primary goal of RBT is to offer a comprehensive suite of GIS tools for accurate river channel measurement and analysis within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software.

5. Constraints: Users must have ESRI ArcGIS installed before using any RBT tools. Additionally, proper DEM acquisition through LiDAR or topographic surveys is essential to ensure accurate results.
