  "abstractText": "Exposure of fish to elevated total dissolved gas can result in gas bubble trauma (GBT). The progresson of GBT and resultingmortality has been described for juvenile salmonids by Mesa et al. (2000). The criteria they used to describe GBT serves as the foundation for the currentmonitoring of GBT in juvenile salmonids by the regional Smolt Monitoring Program. However, the progression of GBT and mortality has not been described for many native, resident nonsalmonids. The purpose of this method is to describe the experimental protocol for testing native, resident nonsalmonid fishes using the methods of Mesa et al. (2000).",
