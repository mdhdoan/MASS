  "abstractText": "Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags have been utilized as a research and management tool in the Columbia River Basin since 1987. PIT-tagging juvenile salmonids collected at juvenile fish screening and bypass facility can be used to conduct site-specific evaluations, estimate survival and travel time in reaches above and below the facility, or for determining the proportion of fish using the facility. A major advantage of PIT-tags over many other marking or tagging methods is that PIT-tagged fish do not need to be physically recaptured; they only need to pass by an automated tag interrogation system. Other advantages include its small size, individual fish identification, long life expectancy (no battery), and relatively simple tagging procedure.",
