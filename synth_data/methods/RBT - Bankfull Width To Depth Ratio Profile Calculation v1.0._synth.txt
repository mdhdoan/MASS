2. Abstract: The RBT is a suite of GIS tools specifically designed for river channel measurement within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software. Using high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from airborne remote sensing like LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys, it calculates various profile metrics at regular intervals along a site. This method intends to provide detailed and accurate river channel measurements while offering the flexibility to customize interval distances and exclude outliers for enhanced data reliability.

3. Description: The RBT is a collection of tools operating in the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software environment, facilitating the precise description and measurement of river channels using high-resolution DEMs. These DEMs can be obtained from airborne remote sensing techniques such as LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys. The tool calculates profile metrics at predefined intervals along the site's length, with customizable interval distances. For the 2011 CHaMP data, the interval distance was set to 0.5 meters.

Each profile metric includes several output values, such as mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for all profile values. Additionally, it calculates filtered mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for a subset of the profile intervals. The filtering process involves removing any values that deviate from the population mean by more than a predetermined number of standard deviations (4 in the case of CHaMP 2011). This filtering aims to exclude outliers and improve data reliability.

The CHaMP - Topographic Point Collection Methods document offers further information on collecting the measurement data analyzed by this calculation method.

4. Target: The primary goal of the RBT is to enable accurate, customizable, and reliable river channel measurements using GIS tools within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software environment.

5. Constraints: The RBT's constraints include the requirement for high-resolution DEMs derived from either airborne remote sensing or ground-based topographic surveys. Additionally, the user must define the interval distance and filtering threshold based on specific project requirements and data characteristics.
