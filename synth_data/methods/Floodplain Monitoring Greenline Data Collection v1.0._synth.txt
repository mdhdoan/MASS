2. Abstract:
This method outlines a procedure for monitoring the composition, woody species individuals, and greenline-to-greenline width (GGW) along the greenline of arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, with a focus on areas with beaver colonies present. The data collected can be used to make early management decisions and assess a variety of stream health indicators, such as erosion susceptibility, wetland community establishment, and invasive species abundance. Measuring GGW over time can also provide insights into landscape level changes and habitat complexity improvement.
3. Description:
The method described in the text is designed to monitor the greenline of arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, with a focus on areas where beaver colonies are present. The monitoring procedure involves collecting data on streamside vegetation and GGW within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats located along the greenline. The data collected can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization, and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence. Specifically, the presence or absence of deep-rooted perennial vegetation, types of hydrophilic species present, and abundance of invasive exotic species found at the greenline can indicate the susceptibility of the streambank to erosion, successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity, and degree of susceptibility to invasive species establishment, respectively. Additionally, changing GGW over time can provide insights into sediment aggradation and habitat complexity improvement.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to monitor the greenline of arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, with a particular emphasis on areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to assess a variety of riparian health indicators and make early management decisions.
5. Constraints:
The constraints for this method include the need for access to streamside areas, the availability of trained personnel to collect data, and potential limitations in the accuracy and precision of data collection methods used. Additionally, the success of the method may be influenced by environmental factors such as weather conditions and seasonal variations in vegetation growth.
