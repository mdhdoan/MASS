 1. Abstract: The text describes a protocol for monitoring and improving the status of the Fifteenmile Creek steelhead population, a subpopulation within the Middle Columbia River steelhead Distinct Population Segment (DPS). This DPS is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, and the goal of the protocol is to recover the population to sustainable levels that would allow for the removal of threatened status. The protocol focuses on improving the accuracy and precision of abundance estimates, determining population dynamics, and establishing a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation program.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: The values underlying this protocol include the importance of preserving biodiversity and recovering threatened species. The problem statement is that the Fifteenmile Creek steelhead population is at risk and in need of conservation efforts to prevent further decline and eventual extinction. The desired outcomes of this protocol are to improve the accuracy and precision of abundance estimates, determine population dynamics, establish a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation program, and contribute to the recovery and delisting of the Middle Columbia River steelhead DPS.
3. Description: This protocol focuses on the use of specific methods and metrics for monitoring and improving the status of the Fifteenmile Creek steelhead population. These include mark-recapture studies for estimating abundance, genetic analysis for determining population structure, and life history analysis for understanding population dynamics. The protocol also emphasizes the importance of collaboration between state and federal agencies, as well as tribal governments and other stakeholders, in implementing and carrying out the recovery plan.
4. Objectives: The objective of this protocol is to improve the accuracy and precision of abundance estimates, determine population dynamics, and establish a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation program for the Fifteenmile Creek steelhead population. This objective covers all aspects of the problem statement, as understanding and addressing these issues are essential for the recovery and delisting of the Middle Columbia River steelhead DPS. Keywords related to this objective include: abundance estimates, population dynamics, mark-recapture studies, genetic analysis, life history analysis, monitoring and evaluation program, and recovery plan.
5. Target: The primary focus or goal of this protocol is the conservation and recovery of the Fifteenmile Creek steelhead population.
6. Constraints: Potential constraints for this protocol include limited resources (funding, personnel, etc.), difficulties in obtaining accurate and precise abundance estimates, and challenges in coordinating and implementing recovery efforts among multiple stakeholders.
