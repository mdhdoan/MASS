2. Abstract: The McNeil Core sampling method, introduced in 1964, is a crucial technique for quantifying subsurface fine sediments in aquatic environments. These sediments are often lost during other sampling methods, such as pebble counts. Focusing on riffle habitats, which are essential for fish spawning, this approach utilizes a volumetric processing method. This includes sorting the McNeil sediment core sample into size categories using stacked sieves and measuring the volume of each category with a displacement flask. The total volume of fine sediments smaller than the sieve sizes is calculated by allowing these particles to settle in a modified graduated cylinder or Imhoff cone, offering valuable insights for environmental monitoring and management.
3. Description: Developed in 1964, McNeil Core sampling is a specialized method aimed at accurately measuring subsurface fine sediments, which tend to be overlooked by other sampling techniques like pebble counts. This method specifically targets riffles, habitats critical for fish spawning, as they are affected by the amount of fine sediment in the substrate. The process begins with sorting a McNeil sediment core sample into various size categories using a series of stacked sieves placed on a sieve processing station. Next, the volume for each sediment size category is calculated using a displacement flask. To determine the total volume of fine sediments smaller than the sieve sizes employed, the method requires the settling of these particles in either a modified graduated cylinder or an Imhoff cone.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to provide a precise and reliable approach for measuring subsurface fine sediment quantities, particularly in riffle habitats, which are vital for fish spawning.
5. Constraints: McNeil Core sampling requires specialized equipment such as stacked sieves, a displacement flask, and a modified graduated cylinder or Imhoff cone. Users must also have access to the monitoringmethods.org method 5397 guidelines for accurate execution. The method's success depends on proper sample handling, precise sieving techniques, and appropriate settling times in the modified graduated cylinder or Imhoff cone.
