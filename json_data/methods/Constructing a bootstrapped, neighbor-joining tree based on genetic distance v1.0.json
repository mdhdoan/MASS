  "abstractText": "Genetic distance refers to the genetic differences (or divergence) between populations within a species. It is important to measure because it provides information to help identify demographically independent populations (DIPs) and major population groups (MPGs) within a species ESU/DPS for viability monitoring purposes.  It can be measured by a variety of parameters with different biological assumptions.  Some common measures of genetic distance include F-statistics (Wright 1978), Reynolds distance or the coancestry distance (Reynolds et al., 1983; see Weir, 1996, p. 167), Neis genetic distance (Nei 1972, 1978), and Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards chord distance (1967).  For all measures, smaller values indicate low genetic differentiation among populations, whereas larger values indicated higher levels of genetic differentiation among populations.  Geneticists often report population pairwise distances in a distance matrix and then construct a genetic tree to summarize and visualize the genetic relationships shown in the distance matrix.  A genetic tree indicates similarities (clusters) among groups identified by branch associations in the genetic distance topology of the tree.The following is a method for constructing a bootstrapped, neighbor-joining tree based on Cavalli-Sforza genetic distance.  However, the Phylip software package can be used to generate other genetic distances (e.g. Neis genetic distances (1972)) and it can produce trees using other methods than neighbor-joining.",
