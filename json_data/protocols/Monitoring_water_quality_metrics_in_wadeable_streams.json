  "background": "This protocol was developed to assess current conditions or to track temporal and spatial trends in specific water quality metrics at point locations or throughout a watershed. This protocol can be employed throughout the year at various levels of stream flow, depending on what the objectives are for the individual/organization. For example, this protocol can be used to assess current water quality conditions, track changes within a year, or from year to year. Our program tracks water quality throughout the Hangman Creek watershed at a total of 25 sites. These sites are distributed throughout the mainstem and tributaries of the upper Hangman Creek watershed; SF Hangman Creek, Indian Creek, Smith Creek, Nehchen Creek, Sheep Creek, and Mission Creek.Beaver can have a large influence on stream function as well as on habitat for various aquatic species. In order to gain a better understanding of this and how water quality metrics may differ from adjacent free-flowing stream habitat, our program will take opportunistic water quality measurements throughout the vertical profile of a beaver pond. This typically takes place at or near the deepest location within the beaver pond and data is gathered at 1-foot intervals.",
