  "abstractText": "In order to have the most accurate and precise escapement estimates, a video bypass chute is incorporated into the weir and live well. This precision and accuracy is due to the following: 1) our video-monitored bypass system continues to show extremely low error rates; 2) our concurrent trapping operations at the same site allow us to evaluate and correct for the error associated with visual misidentification of kelts; and 3) our PIT array provides us with accurate information about both the fraction of the run we sample with the video bypass as well as the adult-to-kelt survival rate.",
