  "backgroundRationale": "<p>CHaMP is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010). CHaMP will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring anadromous salmonids and/or their habitat. The implementation of CHaMP will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in RPA 50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of RPA 56.3, RPA 57, and RPA 3. CHaMP was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel (see section 1.6), at least 9 years.</p>\r\n",

  "objectives": [
    "The stream habitat data will be applied in conjunction with salmonid growth, survival, abundance and productivity data to estimate fish-habitat relationships across the Upper Columbia River Basin area",
    "To generate standardized status and trend and effectiveness monitoring data for salmonid habitat in important Major Population Groups and spaitally diverse watersheds of the Columbia River Basin area.",
    "To assess the quantity and quality of stream habitat for salmonids in wadeable, perennial streams below natural impassible barriers within Technical Recovery Team population boundaries across the UCRB"
  ],
  "keyAssumptions": "<p>The protocol is structured around a general understanding of the link between habitat attributes and how they directly relate to the specific life history requirements of the salmonid fishes managed under the 2008 BiOp. These fish are likely not only responding to watershed and reach conditions but also to the conditions of individual channel units within reaches. Recognizing the importance of how interactions at the channel unit scale affect fish performance has led to an increased emphasis on the quantification of this important scale of fish habitat in the CHaMP protocol. We adopted the Hawkins et al. (1993) hierarchical classification scheme that allows for summarization of information across multiple scales. This preserves the ability to summarize information at the site scale as commonly practiced in major fish habitat monitoring programs throughout the Pacific Northwest as well as at the smaller channel-unit and topographical feature scales. The protocol employs spatially continuous sampling strategies using well-established surveying techniques to conduct precise topographic surveys from which digital elevation models (DEMs) can be produced. These topographic surveys are augmented by auxiliary data (e.g., channel classification, fish cover, substrate composition, distribution and embeddedness, large woody debris (LWD), solar input and water temperature, stream discharge, water chemistry, riparian structure, and site-level human influence) that help to characterize aspects of channel units that influence site-scale fish production potential. The CHaMP protocol draws together methods from many existing protocols as well as novel approaches to collecting and analyzing channel geomorphological data. The protocol is designed to collect data that fits within a geomorphological hierarchy spanning spatial scales ranging from within-unit topographical features to channel units to geomorphic to watershed and subbasin scales.</p>\r\n",
  "dataHandlingConsiderations": "The CHaMP data management plan is integral to ensuring successful capture, quality assurance, and archiving of CHaMP field data along with the derivation and reporting of site-level metrics.  The data system will be comprised of field data capture tools and a centralized database with an online interface.  The online interface will support pre-season site evaluations, tracking project metadata, uploading field data, quality assurance procedures, and reporting derived metrics.  Under this plan, data will initially be captured on handheld field computers and then uploaded to the online database when internet connectivity is available.  A standard set of field data capture devices will be provided which will include data entry applications for the topographic and auxiliary habitat surveys.  This two-part system allows remote capture of data and centralized management of metadata, field measurements, and derived metrics.  Collectively, these tools support CHaMP\u2019s data documentation, data capture, data quality, information archiving, standard metric calculation, and project reporting needs. Topographic survey data and auxiliary data will be captured using separate data logger applications.  Auxiliary data (wood loading, substrate composition, etc.) will be capture by a single crew member using a handheld field computer. The topography survey will create a raw topographic point file (x, y, z data) from which several geo-rectified products will be developed using survey (Leica Geo Office) and Arc GIS 10 software.  A triangular irregular network (TIN) and digital elevation model (DEM) will be created as the base topographic products from the survey.  \r\n",
  "qualityControlConsiderations": "Data quality assurance review will be conducted on a daily basis by crew members and on a weekly basis by the crew supervisor.  The quality assurance review will test for completeness, outliers in numeric data, and outliers in basic summary metrics.  At the end of each day, the crew member will be prompted to verify the number of channel units, total wood pieces, and number of drift samples.  Additionally, the crew will be prompted to review any values recorded as a missing value.  Next the crew will view and verify any numeric outliers. Finally, a short series of graphs will be presented to allow the crew to verify graphical data against their mental image of the site.  At the end of each week, the crew supervisor will perform a similar audit of the data. \r\nData quality assurance for the topographic survey data will take place at four checkpoints within the flow of data from origination on the total station to data storage and web availability.  These checkpoints will reduce the likelihood of data errors compounding throughout data processing.  The four checkpoints are:\r\n1.\tData origination (Total station)\r\n2.\tEnd of day data review (Total station/Data logger)\r\n3.\tEnd of week data processing and review (Laptop)\r\n4.\tCentralized database checks (CHaMP data system)\r\nThe crew lead is responsible for creation and submission of the original point file, a lines file (breaklines), a clean TIN, and a quality assurance report (table in geodatabase).  These should be produced within one week of initial data collection.\r\n",
  "reportingConsiderations": "Site-level metrics will be generated from data submitted to the CHaMP website.  These metrics will be presented in graphical and map format for all sites.  At the end of each field season, crew supervisors will review raw measurements and derived metrics for data completeness, numeric outliers, and ecologic sensibility.  Crew supervisors will be presented a series for graphs through the CHaMP website and asked to verify data quality. ",
  "equipmentCleaningAndCalibration": "Total station and other equipment will be re-calibrated on an annual basis or more frequently as needed. ",
  "rolesAndResponsibilities": "1) The survey crew lays out the site, with two crew members monumenting the bottom of site and working upstream to the top placing transect flagging. The third crew member establishes monuments, benchmarks, control points, and potential survey set-up locations.\r\n2) Once a site has been laid out, two crew members begin surveying the site. A site survey captures channel unit perimeters, maximum pool depths and crested depth, thalweg profile, channel topography, and breaklines establishing the bank and extent of the survey reaching the first floodplain or other elevations beyond the bankfull.\r\n3) The third crew member identifies and flags channel units and collects channel unit-level measurements, including LWD counts, fish cover estimates, and ocular estimates of substrates. Subsurface fines and pebble count measurements are collected in a subset of channel units.\r\n4) The third crew member collects site-level metrics, including drawing the site map, conducting the water quality measurements, taking site and solar pathfinder photos, recording human influences, making riparian estimates, and taking drift net samples.\r\n5) Everyone collects flags once the survey is completed.",
  "qualifications": "Prospective crew members will ideally have a background in biology, preferably in relation to fish, familiarity with GIS, basics of land surveying (e.g., using a total station), and experience living and working in the outdoors. Candidates must be able to work well with others, usually in a crew of 3-6, while enduring long and sometimes arduous days. Camping for multiple days and packing heavy loads of equipment in and out of sites is required periodically. Previous wilderness first aid knowledge is a plus, but not required. ",
  "trainingRequirements": "All crew leaders and members will attend a 10 day pre-season training session. Crew will learn the theoretical background for the CHaMP protocol, proper use and maintenance of all field equipment, and procedures for data management. ",
  "safetyConsiderations": "Each data collection organization will define safety constraints for accessing sites (e.g. sites must be less than 5 trail miles from a trail head and less than 1/2 mile from a trail or road). Sites will be rejected for sampling if the site falls outside these safety constraints. ",
  "fieldScheduleNotes": "Pre-Season (April-June 15th)\tDocument project, statistical design, and site evaluation metadata.\r\n\r\nField-Season (June 15-Sept 30th)\tDaily data capture and quality assurance review of topographic and auxiliary data. Complete weekly quality assurance procedures and generated TIN file for each site. Perform weekly uploads of datasets to CHaMP website.\r\n\r\nPost-Season (Oct 1- Oct 30th)\tEnsure datasets are complete. Perform quality assurance on completed datasets and derived site-level metrics.\r\n",
  "budgetConsiderations": "This protocol requires a wide range of equipment. One of the more expensive devices is the topographic surveying instrument required to survey each site. After some field trials, the CHaMP team settled on a Nikon Total Station:\r\nhttp://www.nikon.com/about/technology/life/others/surveying/index.htm ",
