 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the five highly relevant keywords that I identified from the text body:

1. Steelhead
2. Fin clips
3. Floy tags
4. Coded Wire Tags (CWT)
5. Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract:
This method describes a process for identifying and categorizing steelhead based on external and internal markings. The purpose of this method is to estimate the proportion of naturally produced fish and hatchery-produced fish within a population, as well as the sources of the hatchery fish. This information is crucial for monitoring viable salmonid populations and ensuring compliance with Endangered Species Act recovery efforts.
3. Description:
The method involves collecting steelhead at weirs or traps and checking them for external markings such as fin clips and floy tags, as well as internal markings like Coded Wire Tags (CWT) or Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags. The percentage of naturally produced fish is calculated by dividing the number of unmarked fish by the total number of fish sampled. Similarly, the percentage of hatchery-produced fish is calculated by dividing the number of marked fish by the total number of fish sampled. Additionally, the method can be used to estimate the stray rate of hatchery fish and the proportion of natural spawners within a population. This information can help inform Endangered Species Act recovery efforts for steelhead populations in the Asotin and Tucannon rivers.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to estimate the proportion of naturally produced fish and hatchery-produced fish within a steelhead population, as well as the sources of the hatchery fish. This information is critical for Viable Salmonid Population (VSP) monitoring and Endangered Species Act recovery efforts.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is that it requires access to weirs or traps where steelhead can be collected for sampling. Additionally, the accuracy of the estimates depends on the size and representativeness of the sample.
