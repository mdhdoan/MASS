  "abstractText": "This method uses estimates of predator consumption of juvenile salmon and predator abundance to estimate the total loss of juvenile salmonto predation within a particular time frame and study area. This information can be used to assess the relative importance of predation as a juvenile salmon mortality factor. This method is used with smallmouth bass and juvenile fall Chinook salmon but can be customized for any predator and prey fish.",
