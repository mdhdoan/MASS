2. Abstract: Fish tagging is a crucial method for conducting telemetry studies on fish to understand their movements, distribution, home range, and habitat preferences in natural environments without direct observation or recapture. The two primary techniques for fish tagging are gastric and surgical implantation. Gastric tagging can be performed quickly but carries the risk of esophagus or stomach rupture. In contrast, surgical tagging is more time-consuming, involves increased handling of fish, and increases the potential for infection at the surgical site. However, recent studies suggest that salmonids' growth, feeding behavior, and condition are less affected by surgically implanted tags over an extended period than gastric ones.
3. Description: The text discusses two primary methods for fish tagging in telemetry studies: gastric and surgical implantation. Gastric tagging is a quicker method where the tag is inserted into the stomach of the fish. However, this procedure carries the risk of causing damage to the esophagus or stomach, leading to potential rupture. On the other hand, surgical tagging is more invasive and time-consuming as it involves making an incision in the peritoneal cavity of the fish to insert the tag. This method increases handling of the fish, which can lead to stress and infection at the surgical site. However, recent research has shown that salmonids' growth, feeding behavior, and condition are less affected by surgically implanted tags than gastric ones over an extended period (21 days).
4. Target: The primary focus of fish tagging is to enable telemetry studies on fish movements, distribution, home range, and habitat preference without direct observation or recapture.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for fish tagging include the potential for damage to the fish during gastric tagging, increased handling of fish during surgical tagging, risk of infection at the surgical site, and potential effects on the growth, feeding behavior, and condition of the fish from both methods.
