  "abstract": " This document outlines standard procedures for measuring habitat variables throughout the Columbia Basin Region to ensure consistency with the Columbia River Wildlife Mitigation Program funded by Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The manual is a user-friendly guide for Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) and Combined Habitat Assessment Protocols (CHAP) transect techniques, designed for both novice and experienced field technicians. It includes general protocols, such as pre-survey pilot studies, transect establishment guidelines, and photo documentation parameters, and specific measurement techniques with diagrams where necessary. The manual also assigns alpha-numeric codes to different measurement techniques to simplify report tables and data spreadsheets without lengthy explanations. As the document is intended to be a living one, it will be updated as needed. The use of these standardized protocols and measurement techniques allows for quantifying habitat quality for individual wildlife species and species guilds in line with HEP models and CHAP verification transects."

  "description": " This document serves as a comprehensive guide for collecting consistent habitat variable data throughout the Columbia Basin Region in accordance with the Columbia River Wildlife Mitigation Program, funded by Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The publication is designed to function independently and provides instructions on Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) and Combined Habitat Assessment Protocols (CHAP) transect techniques utilized by the Regional HEP Team (RHT). This user-friendly manual aims to cater to both novice and experienced field technicians, minimizing theoretical and mathematical/statistical discussions.\n\nAssuming that field technicians possess the necessary measuring devices, device descriptions are concise. The manual primarily employs English measurements for compatibility with various HEP models and better public understanding. Metric equivalents can be readily converted if required.\n\nThe document consists of both general and specific protocols. General protocols encompass a brief description of pre-HEP survey pilot studies, transect establishment guidelines, and photo documentation parameters. In contrast, specific metrics outline the actual habitat variable measurement techniques, including diagrams for clarification when necessary. When multiple measurement technique options exist, an alpha-numeric code is assigned to facilitate project managers and field technicians in identifying specific measurement techniques within report tables and data spreadsheets without lengthy explanations.\n\nThe Regional HEP team employs the following standardized protocols and measurement techniques to measure habitat variables as per HEP models and CHAP verification transects:\n\nAssumption: HEP species models can be employed to assess habitat quality for individual wildlife species and species guilds."
