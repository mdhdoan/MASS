2. Abstract: The Human Influences Assessment method is a tool used to estimate the level of human disturbance in the riparian areas of a site. It provides relative information about both the location and type of local disturbances. Despite potential issues with crew variability, this method offers bank-specific estimates that can help manage and mitigate human impacts on the environment.
3. Description: The Human Influences Assessment method is designed to estimate human disturbance within the riparian areas of a site. It provides bank-specific estimates, which are based on crew member observations and assessments. This method offers both location-based (transect and bank) and type-based information about local disturbances, making it useful for identifying areas most affected by human activity. However, its reliance on human observation can lead to variability in the results due to differences in crew members' judgement or interpretation.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to provide bank-specific estimates of human disturbance within riparian areas.
5. Constraints: This method is subject to potential issues arising from crew variability, as measurements are based on crew member estimates and interpretations.
