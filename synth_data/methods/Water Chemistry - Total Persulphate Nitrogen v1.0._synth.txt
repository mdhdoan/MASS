2. Abstract:
The Columbia River Basin has experienced a significant decline in anadromous salmonid populations over the past 30 years, leading to several species being listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). To effectively address this concern, a comprehensive monitoring strategy is required to reduce uncertainties surrounding these declines and develop recovery plans. The method proposed involves implementing continuous monitoring of seven critical water quality attributes at integrator sites, following UCMS guidelines and Data Quality Level A standards. This approach enables multi-scale assessments, addressing ESA requirements while ensuring accurate and reliable data collection for informed decision-making and conservation efforts.

3. Description:
The text discusses the urgent need for a detailed monitoring strategy to address the severe decline in anadromous salmonid populations within the Columbia River Basin. With several species protected under the ESA, it is essential to implement comprehensive monitoring programs to reduce uncertainties and develop effective recovery plans. However, existing data from current and historical monitoring programs are often insufficient or unreliable for ESA assessments and recovery planning purposes.

The proposed method focuses on continuous monitoring of seven water quality attributes—temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus—at integrator sites located at the downstream end of each population or subpopulation distribution. This strategy aligns with UCMS guidelines, ensuring standardization and best practices in data collection. The accuracy of water quality instruments is maintained at Data Quality Level A, as defined by the Oregon Watershed Plan Water Quality Monitoring Technical Guidebook (2001).

By coupling water quality monitoring stations with associated flow gauges operated by the USGS or WDOE, researchers can assess the impact of stream flow on water quality attributes. This integrated approach allows for multi-scale assessments, meeting ESA requirements for species and habitat evaluations at specific reaches, subpopulations, populations, and Evolutionary Significant Units (ESUs).

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to establish a reliable and standardized monitoring strategy for anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin, ensuring accurate data collection at multiple spatial scales to support effective recovery planning and conservation efforts under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

5. Constraints:
The success of this method depends on several factors, including:
   - Consistent funding for long-term monitoring programs
   - Collaboration between various agencies and organizations involved in data collection and management
   - Adherence to UCMS guidelines and Data Quality Level A standards
   - Effective communication of findings to stakeholders and decision-makers.
