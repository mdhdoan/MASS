 1. Abstract: The Colville Confederated Tribes (CCT) Resident Fish Division manages the Colville Resident Fish Hatchery Program to mitigate the loss of anadromous fish resources due to hydroelectric development. The program involves stocking hatchery-origin Rainbow Trout, Brook Trout, and Lahontan Cutthroat Trout in waterbodies on and around the CCT Reservation. Monitoring and evaluation are crucial to guide fish stocking and management decisions based on performance objectives.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: 
   - Value: Importance of preserving and managing fish resources for indigenous communities.
   - Problem Statement: Limited access to anadromous fish resources due to hydroelectric development.
   - Desired Outcome: Improved fisheries management, informed decision-making, and sustainable fish populations in CCT reservation waters.
3. Description: The text details the Colville Resident Fish Hatchery Program's monitoring and evaluation efforts, emphasizing the importance of hatchery-origin fish stocking to compensate for lost anadromous fish resources. The program gathers biological information on stocked populations and estimates trout abundance in stocked water bodies. Additionally, it characterizes water quality, identifies watershed nutrient sources, and formulates recommendations for potential restoration and management options.
4. Objectives: 
   - Objective: Monitor and evaluate the performance of fish stocking to inform decision-making and meet fisheries management goals.
   - Summary of Solution Coverage: The objective covers the entire problem statement, aiming to mitigate the impact of lost anadromous fish resources through informed hatchery-origin fish stocking and watershed management.
   - Keywords: Monitoring, evaluation, informed decision-making, fisheries management, hatchery-origin fish stocking, watershed management.
5. Target: Sustainable and managed fish populations in CCT reservation waters through effective monitoring and evaluation of the fish stocking program.
6. Constraints: The success of this protocol depends on factors such as adequate funding, availability of necessary resources (e.g., personnel, equipment), and collaboration between various stakeholders, including indigenous communities, government agencies, and researchers.
