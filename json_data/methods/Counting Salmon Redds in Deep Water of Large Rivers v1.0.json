  "abstractText": "Female salmonids excavate nests in the gravel called redds (Burner 1951) that appear from above as light colored, regularly shaped, oval areas that contrast with the darker undisturbed river bed for about six weeks after initial construction (Dauble and Watson 1997). Redd counting methods depend on watershed size. Redds are counted in short shallow streams on foot (Welsh 1983; Rieman and McIntyre 1996). Redds are counted in larger rivers from aircraft (Welsh 1983; Heggberget et al. 1986; Dauble and Watson 1997; Visser et al. 2002). Redds in deep rivers have been counted by use of SCUBA gear (Hassemer and Rieman 1981; Swan 1989; Gipson and Hubert 1993), submersible cameras (Nester and Poe 1987; Groves and Garcia 1998; Dauble et al. 1999), and SONAR (Tiffan et al. 2004). This method describes how fall Chinook salmon redds are counted in water > 3-m deep along the Snake River that forms the border between the states of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon.",
