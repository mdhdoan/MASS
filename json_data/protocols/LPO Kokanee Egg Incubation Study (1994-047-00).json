  "background": "This will be done to evaluate incubation success to the pre-emergent stage and help assess the kokanee spawning habitat. Eggs will incubate over the winter and evaluation will occur during the following spring. Upon completion, data collected at the incubation site will be compared to incubation success rates from other locations in the lake that were determined duringprevious studies. This direct measure of kokanee egg to pre-emergent fry survival is one aspect of determining the quality of spawning habitat.",
