2. Abstract: The text describes a method for identifying the spawning stage of adult steelhead trout in freshwater environments. This information is crucial for fishery management and conservation efforts as it allows for more effective monitoring and protection of this species during their vulnerable spawning stages. By utilizing key physical characteristics, observers can quickly determine whether a female steelhead is pre-spawn or post-spawn, contributing to the preservation and understanding of this valuable fish population.

3. Description: The text details a method for identifying the spawning stage of adult female steelhead trout in freshwater ecosystems. Steelhead captured in freshwater are either pre-spawning fish moving upstream to reproduce or post-spawning kelts migrating downstream after reproduction. To differentiate between these two stages, the text outlines various physical characteristics. Pre-spawning steelhead tend to have a more robust and rounded body shape, while post-spawning kelts appear emaciated due to the energy expended during spawning. Additionally, pre-spawn fish display a vibrant coloration, which fades in post-spawn individuals. These characteristics allow for quick and accurate identification of steelhead trout at different stages of their spawning cycle, providing valuable data for fishery management and conservation efforts.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to effectively distinguish pre-spawn from post-spawn adult female steelhead trout in freshwater environments.

5. Constraints: This method's constraints include the necessity of capturing or observing the steelhead closely enough to identify the physical characteristics used for differentiation. Additionally, changes in water clarity, light conditions, or the steelhead's overall health might impact the accuracy of this identification method.
