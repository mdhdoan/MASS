  "abstractText": "Aerial, boat, and land-based surveys can be used to detect the formation of new piscivorous colonial waterbird colonies.  Aerial flights and imagery (photos) are an effecient way to locate new colonies over a broad geographic range, while  boat and land-based visits can be used to confirm the breeding status and breeding chronology of birds identified via aerial surveys. Presented here are the methods used to location new or incipent colonies in and around the Columbia River estuary; colonies that could  form as a result of management initiatives to reduce the size of the Caspian tern and double-crested cormorant colonies on East Sand Island.",
