2. Abstract: Acoustic backscatter technologies have been traditionally used for remote sensing of benthic topography, but these methods often come at a high cost and require significant technical expertise. Recent advancements in the field have led to the availability of off-the-shelf recreational fishing and nautical navigation equipment that incorporates side imaging sonar systems. These systems can produce accurately georeferenced, high-resolution imagery at a relatively low cost, making them useful for aquatic resource managers and researchers. The accuracy and applicability of such systems have been assessed and proven in the management and research of aquatic resources (Kaeser and Litts 2010, Kaeser et al. 2012).
3. Description: Acoustic backscatter technologies are commonly used for remote sensing of benthic topography. These methods typically involve high costs and require significant technical expertise. However, recent advancements in the field have led to recreational fishing and nautical navigation equipment that incorporates side imaging sonar systems. These off-the-shelf systems are relatively low cost and can produce accurately georeferenced, high-resolution imagery. This imagery has been assessed for accuracy and applied to the management and research of aquatic resources (Kaeser and Litts 2010, Kaeser et al. 2012). The use of recreational grade side imaging sonar systems offers a more accessible and cost-effective solution for remote sensing of benthic topography compared to traditional methods.
4. Target: To provide an accessible and cost-effective solution for remote sensing of benthic topography using off-the-shelf recreational fishing and nautical navigation equipment.
5. Constraints: Despite the advancements in acoustic backscatter technologies, there may still be limitations in terms of image resolution and accuracy compared to traditional methods. Additionally, user expertise and understanding of sonar technology principles are required for effective data collection and interpretation.
