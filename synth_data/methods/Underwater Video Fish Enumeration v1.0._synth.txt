2. Abstract: Underwater video systems are employed to monitor and count anadromous salmon species during their migration to upstream spawning sites. By using a DV-IP device and motion detection technology, this method allows for the collection of imagery and conversion to numeric data for analysis. The target species include summer steelhead, sockeye salmon, and Chinook salmon, with locations chosen based on factors like current and historic salmonid use and contemporary discharge levels.

3. Description: Underwater video systems are used in strategic locations to monitor anadromous salmon migration. A DV-IP device is utilized for collecting imagery from specialized underwater cameras positioned in custom-designed video chutes. These cameras provide constant imagery, which is then stored as a log of fish passage events based on motion detection technology. Video technicians remotely review the captured footage and convert it into numeric data for further analysis. The primary focus of this method is to monitor and count target salmonid species (summer steelhead, sockeye salmon, and Chinook salmon) during their migration to upstream spawning areas. Location selection takes various factors into account, such as current and historic salmonid use, contemporary discharge levels, and forecasts.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is the monitoring and counting of anadromous salmon species during their migration to upstream spawning sites.

5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method include limited underwater visibility, environmental factors affecting camera functionality, potential disruptions in data collection, and the need for experienced video technicians to review and analyze captured footage.
