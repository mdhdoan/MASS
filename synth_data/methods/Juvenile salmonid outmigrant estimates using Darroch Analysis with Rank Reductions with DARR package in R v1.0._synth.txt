2. Abstract: The text describes the use of the 'Darroch Analysis with Rank Reductions' (DARR) package in R software for estimating outmigrating juvenile salmonid species from screw trap data. This method uses stratified mark-recapture data and pools strata with similar capture probabilities to calculate an estimate of the species. The step-by-step instructions provided in the text demonstrate the use of DARR for analyzing juvenile Chinook salmon data, specifically using the one trap and no prior pooling of strata options.
3. Description: The DARR package is a software tool for statistical analysis in R, which can be used to estimate outmigrating juvenile salmonid species from screw trap data. The method uses stratified mark-recapture data, where each stratum has a capture probability that varies between and within strata. The DARR package pools together strata with similar capture probabilities to improve the accuracy of the estimation. The method calculates an estimate by using the total number of first time captures, the total number of marked individuals, and the recaptures of those marked fish over the migration period. The text provides a detailed procedure for using DARR in R, using juvenile Chinook salmon as an example.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to estimate outmigrating juvenile salmonid species from screw trap data using the DARR package in R software.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the availability and quality of screw trap data, as well as the accuracy of the capture probabilities used in the analysis. Additionally, the success of the estimation relies on the assumption that the strata have similar capture probabilities, which may not always be the case. Finally, the results obtained from DARR are only an estimate and should not be taken as absolute truth.
