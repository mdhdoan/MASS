  "background": "Critical to the The Chief Joseph Hatchery RM&E program are appropriate tagging/marking of natural origin summer/fall and spring Chinook emigrants to monitor populations status and tred, assess/update key program assumptions and decision rules. These monitoring and assessments will allow the CJH program to annually review previous year's program performance and stock status, thereby allowing the hatchery program to develop the upcoming hatchery implementation plan to manage the program goal.The RM&E program calls for up to 25,000 PIT tagged natural-origin summer/fall Chinook parr/smolts in order to monitor and evaluate the program annually. PIT tagging of natural-origin summer/falljuvenile Chinook occurs at theOkanogan River rotary screw trap sitein and on the Columbia River near the confluence with the Okanogan.",
