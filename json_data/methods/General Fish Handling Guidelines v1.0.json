  "abstractText": "Respectful and careful treatment of fish is critical to the long-term success of monitoring and research programs (Persons et al. 2013). Traumatized fish can exhibit abnormal physiologic, behavioral, and ecologic responses that challenge study purposes (Nickum, 1988). Rough or improper handling of fish is a source of stress that can lead to disease or death. Delayed mortality as a result of improper handling may not be immediately apparent to researchers but can occur hours to days later (Stickney, 1983), causing misleading study results and poor public opinion and potentially resulting in the loss of permits and cancelation of projects. All field personnel should be familiar with and strictly adhere to research permit guidelines and limitations. Sampling procedures should leave sites as undisturbed as possible, and capture techniques should minimize injury to fish.",
