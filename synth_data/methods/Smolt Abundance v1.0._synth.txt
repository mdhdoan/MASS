2. Abstract: The abundance of smolts in a watershed or basin is an essential indicator of the overall health of the aquatic ecosystem. This method involves using traps, such as floating screw traps, to estimate the total number of smolts produced within the area. By monitoring downstream migrating smolts and conducting mark/recapture tests throughout the migration period, researchers can determine trapping efficiency and refine their estimates. This method allows for a more accurate understanding of smolt populations and their impact on the ecosystem.

3. Description: The process of estimating smolt abundance relies on collecting downstream migrating smolts using appropriate traps, such as floating screw traps, based on stream conditions. These traps must operate for the entire duration of the smolt migration to ensure accurate data collection. Trapping efficiency is then estimated using mark/recapture methods throughout the trapping period. The technical aspects of operating the trap, estimating efficiency, and determining the frequency of efficiency tests are detailed in Murdoch et al. (2000).

4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to accurately estimate the abundance of smolts within a watershed or basin.

5. Constraints: This method requires careful consideration of stream conditions when selecting appropriate traps and may be influenced by various factors, such as water flow, debris, and animal behavior. Additionally, mark/recapture tests must be conducted diligently to ensure accurate trapping efficiency estimates.
