2. Abstract: The pebble count procedure is a method used to quantify the composition of streambed substrate in a non-lab setting. This technique measures the size and location of materials that make up the bed and banks of a stream. These measurements are critical for understanding channel morphology, which can influence the stability and resistance to scour during high flow events. Furthermore, the frequency of bed load transport is significant for aquatic organisms such as fish that use the substrate for spawning and cover. By following bankfull constraints, this method provides a reliable and efficient way to assess streambed composition without having to collect samples and conduct lab analysis.

3. Description: The pebble count procedure is designed to quantify streambed substrate using in-situ measurements along main channel and side channels transects. This technique measures the size of substrate materials at regular intervals within bankfull constraints, without requiring the collection and laboratory analysis of samples. By measuring bed load transport frequency and the composition of materials that make up the bed and banks of a stream, this method can provide critical information for understanding channel morphology. Channel stability and resistance to scour during high flow events are influenced by the type and size of materials present in the streambed. The pebble count procedure is particularly useful for assessing these factors because it allows researchers to gather data quickly and efficiently without the need for laboratory equipment.

4. Target: The primary focus of the pebble count procedure is to provide a reliable, efficient method for quantifying the composition of streambed substrate in a non-lab setting.

5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the requirement to follow bankfull constraints when taking measurements and the need for specialized equipment to measure the size of substrate materials accurately. Additionally, the accuracy of the pebble count procedure may be affected by factors such as water flow rates, sediment transport, and other environmental variables that can impact the stability and composition of streambed materials.
