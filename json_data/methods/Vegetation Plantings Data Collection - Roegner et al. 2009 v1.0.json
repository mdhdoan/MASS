  "abstractText": "Vegetation planting can increase the rate at which desired species become established at a restoration site. Planting native vegetation can reduce erosion, increase cover and shade, and often reduce nonnative invasive species (e.g., reed canary grass). To date, native vegetation plantings in the Columbia River estuary have been primarily trees and shrubs (woody species); however, this protocol outlines methods for monitoring woody species and herbaceous species (e.g., emergent wetland vegetation) to meet potential needs as restoration efforts increase in scope and diversity. The effectiveness of habitat vegetation plantings can be determined by assessing survival, overall health, and growth of the plantings over time. Often, invasive species management is a critical component to ensure the success of native species. It is important to determine a criterion for success when monitoring vegetation plantings to ensure that the project goals are being achieved and, if not, adaptive management corrections should be implemented. Examples of success criteria are 1) percentage of tree or shrub survival (stems per unit area) of initial planting stock, 2) amount of area covered by vegetation plantings, or 3) similarity to reference system within an established time period.",
