  "background": "Our goal isto more clearly understandfactors that influence kokanee survival at early life-stages in Lake Pend Oreille (LPO). Specifically, we will focus on diet and growth of kokanee fry, both of hatchery and wild origin. We have not solidified the exact study design, but the methods will be similar to Clarke and Bennett (2002). We will compare the results of this work to the results of another study aimed at evaluating the spatial and temporal distribution and density of mysids and zooplankton.",
