2. Abstract: This method focuses on the use of mainstem habitats by juvenile salmonids to aid Action Agencies and services in making informed, adaptive management decisions. The data collected will also serve to inform long-term management planning in warmer water conditions and evaluate the effectiveness of temperature and habitat restoration mitigation measures. This method involves characterizing field sites where physical habitat data is collected to determine their suitability as fish habitats, while also providing the ability to document current weather conditions at any field site.

3. Description: The text describes a method used for collecting and analyzing data on juvenile salmonids' use of mainstem habitats. This information will be employed by Action Agencies and services in making year-to-year adaptive management decisions, providing valuable occupancy and habitat use details under warmer water conditions to inform long-term planning. The method further emphasizes the evaluation of temperature and habitat restoration mitigation measures' effectiveness through detailed data collection on physical habitats at sampled fish sites and known coldwater refuges. This approach also allows for the documentation of current weather conditions at any field site, making it a versatile tool for environmental monitoring and management.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide adaptive management decision support for Action Agencies and services, while offering valuable insights into juvenile salmonids' use of mainstem habitats in various water temperature conditions, ultimately aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of restoration mitigation measures.

5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method may include limited accessibility to field sites, resource availability for data collection and analysis, and the need for specialized knowledge or equipment to accurately assess fish habitats and weather conditions. Additionally, environmental factors such as extreme weather events or unexpected changes in water temperature may impact data collection and interpretation.
