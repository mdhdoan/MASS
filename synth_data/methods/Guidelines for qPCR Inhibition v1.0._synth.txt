2. Abstract: PCR inhibition is a common issue in water sample analysis that can lead to decreased assay sensitivity, inaccurate template quantification, and increased potential for false negatives. This problem highlights the necessity of detecting and mitigating PCR inhibition. Various approaches can be employed to reduce inhibition, but the effectiveness of these solutions depends on the type of inhibitors present.
3. Description: The text discusses the consequences of PCR inhibition in water sample analysis, which include decreased assay sensitivity, less accurate template quantification, and a higher likelihood of false negatives (Jane et al., 2015; McKee, Spear & Pierson, 2015). To address this challenge, it is crucial to identify and overcome PCR inhibition. When evidence of PCR inhibition is found, multiple strategies can be used to reduce inhibition. However, the potential solutions for minimizing inhibition depend on the specific inhibitors involved (McKee, Spear & Pierson, 2015).
4. Target: The primary focus of the method is to detect and circumvent PCR inhibition in water sample analysis.
5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method include the identification and characterization of various inhibitors that can cause PCR inhibition and the development of effective strategies to mitigate their effects on assay sensitivity, template quantification, and false negatives.
