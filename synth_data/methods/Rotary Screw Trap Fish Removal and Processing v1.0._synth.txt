2. Abstract: The text describes a method for monitoring and maintaining rotary screw traps (RST) used for capturing fish during their emigration. Employing factors such as catch rates, trap capacity, stream discharge level, debris loads, and upstream hatchery releases, the frequency of trap checks and subsequent fish processing is determined to ensure safe holding conditions for the captured fish while protecting equipment. By reducing stress through careful handling, monitoring, and adjusting check frequencies, this method promotes responsible fish management.
3. Description: The necessity of the RST monitoring method arises from the need to manage fish populations during emigration while ensuring their safety and well-being. Adjusting trap checking frequency based on catch rates, time of year, trap capacity, stream discharge level, debris loads, and upstream hatchery releases enables responsible management and protection of equipment. One to three person trap crews perform the fish processing, taking precautions to reduce stress by conducting operations early in the morning, out of direct sunlight, and avoiding warm afternoon water temperatures. The focus is on preserving fish health during handling, maintaining safe holding conditions, and protecting equipment from damage.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is responsible fish management through monitoring and adjusting RST checking frequency based on various environmental factors and processing considerations.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for the current method include adherence to specific fish handling procedures, ensuring safe holding conditions, managing equipment protection, and accommodating varying environmental factors (e.g., time of year, stream discharge levels, debris loads) that can impact trap checking frequency and subsequent processing requirements.
