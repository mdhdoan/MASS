 1. Keywords: groundwater wells, data logging pressure transducer, water level changes, aquifer health, manual water level measurements, data correction.

2. Abstract: This method is crucial for accurately analyzing groundwater well data using a pressure transducer to measure water levels. The technique corrects pressure transducer data by aligning it with manual water level measurements, providing more reliable insights into aquifer health and groundwater-surface water interactions. This approach ensures that the data reflects real-world conditions, enhancing its value for various projects and studies.

3. Description: The text details a method to correct pressure transducer data from groundwater wells by comparing it with manual water level measurements. Pressure transducers are often used in groundwater wells to capture water levels changes over time. However, these data may require corrections before analysis to ensure accuracy and reliability. By aligning the pressure transducer data with manual water level measurements, researchers can improve the quality of their data, making it more valuable for determining trends in aquifer health, groundwater-surface water interactions, and other projects.

4. Target: The primary focus is to enhance the accuracy and reliability of pressure transducer data from groundwater wells by aligning it with manual water level measurements.

5. Constraints: Some limitations of this method may include the need for regular manual water level measurements, potential discrepancies between the two measurement methods due to differences in timing or precision, and the requirement for specialized equipment and knowledge to install and maintain pressure transducers.
