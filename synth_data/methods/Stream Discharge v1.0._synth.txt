2. Abstract: The text describes a method for accurately measuring stream discharge, a crucial parameter in hydrology and water resource management. By breaking down the stream into smaller increments and calculating the mean velocity and flow cross-sectional area at each increment, a more accurate estimate of the overall discharge can be obtained. This method emphasizes careful selection of a channel cross-section that is as close to a canal as possible, with a U-shaped channel cross-section and minimal obstructions, to ensure accuracy.

3. Description: The necessity for measuring stream discharge accurately arises due to the significant variations in velocity and depth across a stream. To overcome this challenge, the method suggests breaking down the stream into smaller increments and calculating the mean velocity and flow cross-sectional area at each increment. These subtotals are then summed up to obtain the overall discharge measurement. This approach provides more accurate results compared to measuring the discharge at a single point in the stream. It is important to choose a channel cross-section that resembles a canal as closely as possible, with a U-shaped channel cross-section and free of obstructions for best results. The text also recommends removing any rocks or other obstructions before making measurements to improve the accuracy of the cross-section used in the calculation.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide accurate stream discharge measurements by breaking down a stream into smaller increments and calculating the mean velocity and flow cross-sectional area at each increment.

5. Constraints: The success of this method depends on several constraints, including careful selection of a channel cross-section that resembles a canal, removal of obstructions to improve the cross-section before any measurements are made, and accurate measurement of the mean velocity and flow cross-sectional area at each increment.
