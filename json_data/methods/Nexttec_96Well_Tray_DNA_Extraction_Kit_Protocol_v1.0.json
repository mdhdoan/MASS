  "abstractText": "There are many types of DNA extraction kits and protocols.  One that has proven to yield high quality/quantity DNA extract for SNP genotyping is the nexttecTM Clean Plates 96 fish protocol.As opposed to most other kits/protocols, no DNA is retained by the column resin. Instead proteins, detergents and low molecular weight compounds are retained. DNA passes through the column during a short, one-step purification procedure.The obtained DNA is suitable for common enzymatic reactions (restriction digests, real-time PCR, PCR, SNP genotyping etc.).",
