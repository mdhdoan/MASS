2. Abstract:
Fyke netting is a passive sampling method used for monitoring juvenile salmon and steelhead in lentic habitats and estuarine areas. This method involves using large hoop nets with funnels that direct swimming fish into the trap. Fyke nets are commonly used to monitor yearly changes in fish species abundances in sites where seining cannot be used alone or in combination with other methods for a mark-recapture study. They are particularly useful in capturing cover-seeking mobile and migratory species that follow shorelines. Fyke netting is a non-stressful method of sampling, allowing most captured fish to be released unharmed.

3. Description:
Fyke netting is a passive capture method used for sampling juvenile salmon and steelhead in lentic habitats and estuarine areas. The nets consist of large hoop nets with wings or leads that act as funnels, directing swimming fish into the trap. The second and third frames each hold funnel throats, which prevent fish from escaping as they enter each section. The opposite end of the net may be tied with a slip cord to facilitate fish removal. These nets are typically used in shallow water, although deep-set approaches have been used in lakes with depths up to 10 m over the first frame. Fyke nets tend to be the most useful in capturing cover-seeking mobile species and migratory species that follow shorelines. Modified fyke nets have rectangular frames to enhance their stability, preventing them from rolling on the bottom substrate. Fyke netting is a widely used method for assessing fisheries stocks due to its low mortality of fish and aspects of species and size selectivity.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of fyke netting is to monitor the yearly changes in fish species abundances in sites where seining cannot be used alone or in combination with other methods for a mark-recapture study. It is particularly useful in capturing cover-seeking mobile and migratory species that follow shorelines.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of fyke netting is that it requires suitable habitats with moving fish that can intercept leads. Additionally, if the habitat has large and uneven substrate, significant woody debris, or other obstructions, seining may not be possible, and fyke nets may provide a viable alternative, but their effectiveness may be limited. Another constraint is the need for regular monitoring and maintenance of the nets to ensure that they are functioning correctly and not causing undue harm to captured fish.
