 1. Abstract: The Colville Confederated Tribes (CCT) Resident Fish Resource Management and Evaluation (RM&E) project aims to conserve, enhance, and restore native fish populations in the blocked area above Grand Coulee Dam, with a focus on redband trout in the Sanpoil River. A comprehensive plan is developed to monitor redband trout populations using a screw trap for collecting juvenile fish. The objective is to estimate juvenile redband trout recruitment from the Sanpoil River into Lake Roosevelt, contributing to effective fisheries management and potential limiting factors identification.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes:
	* Value: Importance of preserving native fish populations, recreational fishing opportunities, and cultural significance for CCT members
	* Problem Statement: Limited understanding of redband trout population structure, historical management activities, geography, and life history strategies in the blocked area above Grand Coulee Dam
	* Desired Outcomes: Improved fisheries management through data-driven decision making, conservation of redband trout populations, addressing potential limiting factors, and enabling subsistence harvest for CCT members and recreational anglers.
3. Description: The RM&E project uses a screw trap to collect juvenile redband trout from the Sanpoil River. Collaborating with regional co-managers, a stock assessment plan is implemented, focusing on four primary tasks: monitoring abundance, recruitment, harvest, and escapement. A multi-year data set will be established, allowing managers to monitor trends over time and identify potential limiting factors.
4. Objectives:
	* Estimate juvenile redband trout recruitment from the Sanpoil River into Lake Roosevelt
	* Develop a multi-year data set for trend analysis and limiting factor identification
	* Support effective fisheries management through informed decision making
5. Target: Monitoring and estimating redband trout recruitment in the Sanpoil River and Lake Roosevelt
6. Constraints: The success of this protocol relies on the assumption that the screw trap is an adequate method for collecting juvenile redband trout. Potential constraints include limitations in the screw trap's effectiveness, environmental factors affecting fish migration, or insufficient data to draw meaningful conclusions.
