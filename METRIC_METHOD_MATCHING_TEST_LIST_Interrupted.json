Without such definitions or guidelines, my response would be a list of possible matches, not necessarily the correct ones:\n\n1. Percent Canopy Cover and Percent No Canopy for tree sizes: This metric seems related to Method #845, Percent Riparian Woody Cover. However, the method title includes \"canopy cover\" and \"tree sizes,\" while this metric does not explicitly mention those terms. Instead, it talks about \"percentage cover for groundstory, understory, and canopy cover.\" To ensure a good match, I would need to confirm that Method #845 also covers groundstory and understory percentages, and that the method title is not misleading in this regard.\n2. RBT - Integrated Bankfull Width Calculation: This metric's description mentions using \"GIS tools within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software.\" The title of Method #836 also includes the term \"topographic point collection methods,\" which seems relevant to this metric but is not explicitly mentioned in the description. To ensure a good match, I would need to confirm that Method #836 does indeed involve using GIS tools within ArcGIS and that the method title is not misleading in this regard.\n3. Stream Temperature Logger Calculations: This metric's description mentions \"temperature loggers\" and calculating statistics for daily, monthly, and 8-day running temperatures. Method #1247 has a title that includes \"Stream temperature logger calculations.\" Based on the information provided, it appears that this is a good match.\n4. Percent Riparian Woody Cover v2.0: This metric's description mentions estimating percent woody cover for groundstory, understory, and canopy cover. Method #1247 also has a title that includes \"Percent riparian woody cover.\" Based on the information provided, it appears that this is a good match.\n5. Side Channel Area Metrics: The metric's description mentions calculating total side channel area and the proportion of side channels to reach area. Method #836 has a title that includes \"Stream Temperature Logger Calculations,\" which doesn't seem to be a good match for this metric based on its description alone. However, I would need to investigate further to see if there is any overlap between the methods.\n\nGiven these potential matches and the uncertainties involved in making a definitive assessment based solely on the descriptions provided, it is important to approach this problem with caution and to consult additional resources or expertise as needed.\n\nTo answer your question directly: Based on the information given, I cannot confidently provide you with an accurate list of methods names only that match each metric description. However, I have suggested several possible matches based on my interpretation of the provided descriptions. To confirm these matches, you would need to investigate further and possibly consult additional resources or experts in the field."
