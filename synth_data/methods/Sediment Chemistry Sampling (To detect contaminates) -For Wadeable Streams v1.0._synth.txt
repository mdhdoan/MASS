2. Abstract: This method details the process of collecting and analyzing a site-composite sediment sample from stream sites. The purpose is to detect the presence of specific contaminants, such as metals (copper, lead, zinc, arsenic) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds. The analysis also includes total organic carbon and grain size composition to aid in interpreting the results. This comprehensive approach ensures a thorough examination of potential contamination at the site.
3. Description: The method explains how to collect a site-composite sediment sample from stream sites during day-long data collection events (DCEs). Each composite sample consists of scoops taken from three separately located shallow-water stations in the site. The sample undergoes analysis for metals, including copper, lead, zinc, and arsenic, as well as a standard list of PAH compounds. To help interpret the results, further analysis includes total organic carbon and grain size composition. These additional analyses provide context for understanding the presence and impact of contaminants at the site.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to detect and analyze specific contaminants in stream sediment sites.
5. Constraints: The method requires proper equipment for collecting and analyzing sediment samples, as well as knowledge of the targeted contaminants. Additionally, the analysis may be influenced by external factors such as weather conditions during data collection events. Time and resource constraints also exist, as each composite sample requires a full day for collection and analysis.
