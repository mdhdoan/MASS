  "abstract": " This text describes a protocol for measuring and recording streamflow, which is essential for managing water resources and related projects. The method involves six major topics: measurement of stage and discharge, selection of gaging-station sites, computation of the stage-discharge relation, computation of daily discharge records, presentation and publication of data, and use of auxiliary networks.\n\nThe necessity of this method lies in the importance of streamflow for various purposes such as domestic, commercial, industrial use, irrigation, energy generation, transportation, and recreation. Continuous records of discharge at stream-gaging stations help in planning and designing water projects, managing existing ones, and making long-term plans based on availability and variability of streamflow.\n\nThe text explains that networks of continuous record stations are often supplemented with auxiliary networks to meet specific demands for streamflow information at lower costs. For instance, an auxiliary network may provide instantaneous peak discharge data or measure only low flow to support regional flood studies or drought management, respectively.\n\nIn summary, this method ensures the accurate measurement and recording of streamflow through a systematic approach to provide necessary data for short-term (annual), medium-term (5-10 years), and long-term (>10 years) management actions and projects. The location selection takes advantage of optimal conditions for developing a stable stage-discharge relation."

  "description": " This protocol outlines standardized stream-gaging procedures for obtaining systematic records of streamflow, primarily intended as a training guide and reference text for hydraulic engineers and technicians at the U.S. Geological Survey, but also applicable to other practitioners. The text is structured around six major topics:\n\n1. **Measurement of stage and discharge:** This section covers the techniques for measuring water surface elevation (stage) and volume flow rate (discharge).\n2. **Selection of gaging-station sites:** The process of identifying appropriate locations for installing streamflow measurement instruments is discussed.\n3. **Measurement of stage:** Techniques for accurately measuring water surface elevation, such as using staff gauges or electronic devices, are presented.\n4. **Measurement of discharge:** Various methods for measuring discharge, including the use of weirs and current meters, are explained.\n5. **Computation of discharge:** Procedures for calculating discharge based on stage measurements and site-specific data are discussed.\n6. **Computation of stage-discharge relation and daily-discharge records:** This topic covers the methods for establishing a relationship between water surface elevation and discharge, as well as computing daily-discharge records.\n\nStreamflow plays a crucial role in various aspects of human life, including supplying water for domestic, commercial, industrial use; irrigation; dilution and transport of wastes; hydroelectric power generation; transportation channels; and recreation. Continuous streamflow records obtained from gaging stations are essential for developing reliable surface-water supplies by providing information on the availability and variability of streamflow in time and space. Gaging networks consist of continuous-record stations, augmented by auxiliary networks to meet specific demands for streamflow data at different cost levels.\n\nThe text assumes that short-term management actions, medium term project implementation, and long-term management strategies impact the magnitude, timing, and duration of stream flow. Flow gauging offers the opportunity to assess watershed conditions and monitoring objectives span a combination of short (annual), medium (5-10 years), and long-term (>10 years) timeframes."
