2. Fish health
3. Adaptive management
4. Technical Oversight Group (TOG)
5. Field observations

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
The construction and operation of a weir can have negative effects on fish health, particularly for migrating salmon and other aquatic resources. To mitigate these effects, this method employs adaptive management techniques, including daily assessments of injured or dead fish, reporting of critical situations to project leads, and consultation with a Technical Oversight Group (TOG) to recommend adjustments to the weir's operations based on the size class of the affected fish. This approach aims to minimize bodily injury and mortality to fish while allowing for the continued operation of the weir.

3. Description:
The text body describes a method for evaluating and mitigating the negative effects of a weir on fish health. Data on injured or dead fish are collected daily and assessed for potential negative impacts. If a critical situation is reported, the project lead will consult with the TOG to recommend adjustments to the weir's operations, such as changing the spacing of pickets based on the size class of the affected fish. The Project Lead will then implement the recommendation and monitor its effect. This process of adaptive management allows for a proactive approach to addressing negative impacts on fish health.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to minimize bodily injury and mortality to fish resulting from the construction and operation of a weir, while allowing for continued use of the structure.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is the need for frequent data collection and assessment, as well as the availability of a TOG to provide recommendations for adjusting the weir's operations. Additionally, the success of this method depends on the ability to accurately identify negative impacts on fish health and to implement effective adjustments in a timely manner.
