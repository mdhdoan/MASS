  "abstractText": "The estimates of adult spawner abundance and/or redd counts pre- and post-project will allow the investigator to determine whether there has been an increase in the abundance of spawners post treatment and to ascertain whether the project was effective in allowing more adult fish to spawn. Instead of a randomly selected stream reach, the stream reach impacted by the project is sampled. These impact reaches have been matched with control reaches of the same length and size on the same stream whenever possible in order to produce a BACI experimental design.",
