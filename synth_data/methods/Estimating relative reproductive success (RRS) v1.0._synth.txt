2. Abstract: This method outlines the process of estimating the relative reproductive success (RRS) of hatchery-origin (HOR) and natural-origin (NOR) steelhead using DNA extraction and genotyping of standardized microsatellite loci. The purpose is to monitor the success of HOR individuals in the wild over multiple generations, gaining insights into the impact of hatchery supplementation on natural population production and fitness. This information helps minimize genetic risks and contributes to the recovery of fish populations.
3. Description: The use of integrated broodstocks minimizes genetic risks and supports the recovery of a population by maintaining the genetic integrity of the hatchery component and ensuring successful reproduction of HOR fish in the wild. Recent studies show decreased fitness in HOR fish compared to wild-type fish. This method details an approach for estimating RRS of naturally spawning HOR and NOR steelhead using data generated from DNA extraction (DNeasy; Method 1353) and genotyping of standardized microsatellite loci in steelhead (SPAN loci; Method 4002). By tracking the success of HOR individuals in natural environments across generations, researchers can assess the consequences of hatchery supplementation on the production and fitness of wild populations.
4. Target: The primary focus is to measure and understand the impact of hatchery-origin steelhead on natural population productivity and fitness.
5. Constraints: Potential constraints include limited access to hatchery and natural spawning data, variability in microsatellite loci genotyping techniques, and potential inconsistencies in tracking HOR individuals over multiple generations in the wild.
