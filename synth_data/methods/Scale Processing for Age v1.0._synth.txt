 1. Keywords: Anadromous fish populations, Age composition data, Brood years, Cohort analysis, Productivity and survival rates.
2. Abstract: Age composition data plays a crucial role in monitoring the recovery of wild anadromous fish populations listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). By assigning returning adults to specific brood years, cohort analysis can be performed to understand the age structure and dynamics of the population. This information is essential for estimating productivity and survival rates, which are critical indicators of a population's health and recovery status.
3. Description: The text describes the importance of collecting age data for anadromous fish populations, specifically at the location LGR. Age data collected at LGR are used to assign returning adults to specific brood years, allowing for cohort analysis. Cohort analysis is a method used to study the age structure and dynamics of a population over time. By estimating productivity and survival rates, managers can monitor the recovery of wild anadromous fish populations listed under the ESA. These estimates provide valuable insights into the health and viability of the population, helping to inform conservation and management efforts.
4. Target: The primary focus is on the use of age composition data for monitoring the recovery of wild anadromous fish populations listed under the ESA.
5. Constraints: The method described in the text may be limited by the availability and accuracy of age data collected at LGR, as well as the complexity of cohort analysis and estimation of productivity and survival rates.
