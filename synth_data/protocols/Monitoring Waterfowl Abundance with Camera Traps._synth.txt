 Sure, I'd be happy to help label the topics for your text body. Here's my analysis:

1. Abstract:
The text describes a new photo monitoring surveys protocol aimed at effectively monitoring waterfowl use during late winter and spring migration. The need for this protocol arises from the observation that waterfowl positively respond to moist soil management activities and associated uplands, which makes camera traps an ideal tool for monitoring their use.
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes:
Values: Conservation of waterfowl populations, accurate data collection, efficient use of resources.
Problem Statement: Current fixed-wing waterfowl surveys may not be as effective in capturing the nuances of waterfowl migration patterns and behaviors.
Desired outcomes: Effective monitoring of waterfowl use throughout late winter and spring migration using camera traps, better understanding of waterfowl migration patterns and behaviors, improved conservation efforts.
3. Description:
The text describes a new protocol for photo monitoring surveys that will replace fixed-wing waterfowl surveys. The new protocol involves the use of camera traps to monitor waterfowl use throughout late winter and spring migration. Camera traps are preferred because waterfowl respond positively to moist soil management activities and associated uplands, making it easier to capture their movements on camera.
4. Objectives:
Objective: To effectively monitor waterfowl use throughout late winter and spring migration using camera traps.
Summary of Solution Coverage: The objective covers the entire problem statement by providing a solution that addresses the limitations of fixed-wing waterfowl surveys.
Keywords: photo monitoring surveys, camera traps, waterfowl use, late winter, spring migration.
5. Target:
The primary focus of the protocol is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of waterfowl monitoring efforts throughout late winter and spring migration.
6. Constraints:
Constraints for the current protocol may include budget limitations, availability and accessibility of camera traps, and the need for proper training and maintenance of camera trap equipment.
