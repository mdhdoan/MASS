2. Abstract: This text describes the method used to identify and define a specific type of water feature, called a "pool." Pools are depressions in a streambed with slower, flatter water at baseflow, and they are characterized by their distinct features such as the head crest (an upstream increase in slope) and pool tail (the shallowest downstream location). This method provides clear definitions and visualizations to aid in identifying and understanding these natural formations.
3. Description: A pool is defined as a depression in a streambed that is both laterally and longitudinally concave, meaning it has a bowl-like shape. The water within a pool is slower and flatter than upstream or downstream waters at baseflow. Pools are bound by two distinct features - the head crest, which is an upstream increase in streambed slope, and the pool tail, which is a downstream leveling of the streambed slope and reduction in depth. The pool tail serves as the shallowest downstream location from where water would spill if the flow were reduced to a trickle.
4. Target: The target of this method is to clearly define and identify the natural water feature known as a "pool" by describing its unique characteristics, including its shape, water flow, and bounding features.
5. Constraints: This method does not specify any particular constraints for identifying or defining pools, but it requires an understanding of streambed topography and water flow dynamics. It may be limited in applicability to environments where the necessary data is available.
