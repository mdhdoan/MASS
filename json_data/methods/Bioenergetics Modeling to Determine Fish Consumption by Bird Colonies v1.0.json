  "abstractText": "A bioenergetics model can be used to obtain reliable estimates of the number of juvenile salmonids and other prey types consumed by bird colonies. The bioenergetics model uses estimates of the energy requirements of the Caspian tern or double-crested cormorant nesting population and the proportion of bird energy requirements met by various prey types found in the diet.",
