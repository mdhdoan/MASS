  "abstract": " This text describes a method used to determine the origin of certain fish species based on physical marks and tags. The clipped adipose fin is an indicator of hatchery-raised fish, while the presence of coded wire tags (CWT) in their snouts confirms this origin.\n\nThe necessity of this method lies in the importance of knowing the source of fish for various reasons such as stock management, fisheries research, and conservation efforts. By examining these physical marks, fish biologists and researchers can identify hatchery-raised fish, which is crucial information for managing wild fish populations and preventing overfishing.\n\nThis method solves issues related to the difficulty of distinguishing between wild and hatchery-raised fish based on their appearance alone. The clipped adipose fin and CWT tags provide objective and reliable indicators of hatchery origin, helping ensure accurate population assessments and effective fisheries management.\n\nHere's a simplified version without code:\n\nThis text discusses the significance of identifying the origins of fish. Fish with clipped adipose fins and coded wire tags in their snouts are hatchery-raised. These markers help distinguish between wild and farmed fish, ensuring accurate stock management and effective conservation efforts."

  "description": " The text focuses on the role of marks in identifying the origin of fish. More specifically, it discusses two types of marks: clipped adipose fins and coded wire tags (CWT) implanted in the snout.\n\nThe presence of a clipped adipose fin is an indicator that the fish has been raised in a hatchery. An adipose fin is a small, fat-filled fin located at the base of the caudal fin in some fish species. Hatcheries often clip this fin as part of their stocking process to facilitate easier identification of hatchery-raised fish.\n\nCoded wire tags (CWT), on the other hand, are implanted in the snout of fish for individual identification and tracking purposes. Each tag contains a unique combination of numbers or letters, which can be read using specialized equipment. The text implies that many hatchery-raised fish have these tags implanted.\n\nIn summary, marks such as clipped adipose fins and coded wire tags (CWT) serve essential functions in identifying the origin and individuality of fish. Clipped adipose fins are a common indicator of hatchery-raised fish, while CWTs provide unique identification numbers for tracking purposes."

  "constraints": " Based on the provided text, there are no specific constraints mentioned regarding the method or where in the method it's stated. The text primarily discusses how marks, such as a clipped adipose fin and coded wire tags (CWT), can be used to determine the origin of a fish. However, this information is descriptive and does not impose any constraints on the method itself. If there are specific methods being referred to in the text that require certain constraints, more context would be needed for an accurate assessment."
