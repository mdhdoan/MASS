2. Abstract: This method describes a process for collecting a representative benthic invertebrate sample from streams to study the abundance and composition of the macroinvertebrate community. By using a targeted riffle sampling approach with a fixed area design and surber-style net, this method ensures a standardized and quantitative sample is obtained. This data can be used to assess stream health and ecological functioning.
3. Description: The objective of this method is to collect a quantitative benthic invertebrate sample for describing the abundance and composition of the macroinvertebrate community in streams. A targeted riffle sampling approach is employed, where fast water habitats (e.g., riffles) are chosen as they provide optimal conditions for macroinvertebrates. Subsamples are collected using a fixed area design with a 500 mm mesh, 0.09 m2 fixed-area surber-style benthic invertebrate sample net. Four different fast-water habitat units are sampled and two separate samples are taken from each unit. The number of sub-samples is recorded on the Benthic Sample Field Data form. Invertebrates are collected from within the 0.09 m2 sampling frame in front of the net, by systematically working from the upstream edge of the sampling plot and carefully picking up and rubbing stones directly in front of the net to remove attached organisms. Small substrates (sand or gravel) are disturbed to a depth of about 10 cm by raking and stirring with hands to ensure all organisms are collected.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to collect a quantitative benthic invertebrate sample for describing the abundance and composition of the macroinvertebrate community in streams.
5. Constraints: This method requires access to clean water sources with suitable fast-water habitats, appropriate sampling equipment (e.g., surber-style net), and adequate time for thorough sample collection and processing.
