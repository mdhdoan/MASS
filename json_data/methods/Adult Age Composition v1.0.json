  "abstractText": "There are several advantages to using PIT-tags for developing age structure data.. First, the detection systems in adult dam ladders provide both a high sampling rate (effectively 100%) and a consistent sampling environment for collecting age at maturity data. PIT-tags also allow for individual identification and for determining stock origin, which can be useful partitioning sources of variation among the mixed-stock populations that comprise the overall returns.",
