2. Abstract: The use of artificial salmonid redds, such as egg incubation boxes, has been a common method for establishing or re-establishing fish runs following restoration projects. However, these devices face challenges in sediment-heavy systems where they can become filled with sediment and lead to fungal growth due to dead eggs. High flow rates and bed movement can also cause the boxes to be lost in the river. To address these issues, direct egg planting is presented as a logical alternative that reduces loss from sediment, equipment failure, and accumulation of plastic egg boxes in the river ecosystem.
3. Description: Artificial salmonid redds, including egg incubation boxes, have been utilized to help establish or enhance fish runs following restoration projects (Harshbarger and Porter 1982; Gustafson-Marjanen and Moring 1994). These devices are designed to improve spawning success in habitats that may be underutilized. However, sediment accumulation in these systems can lead to egg suffocation and the growth of fungus from dead eggs within the boxes (Donaghy and Verspoor 2000). Moreover, high flow rates and bed movement can cause the boxes to become detached from their anchoring system and lost in the river. To mitigate these problems, direct egg planting is suggested as a more effective method for spawning salmonids in certain systems. This approach reduces losses due to sediment accumulation, equipment failure, and the buildup of plastic egg boxes in the river ecosystem.
4. Target: The primary goal is to improve salmonid spawning success in sediment-heavy or high-flow environments by using direct egg planting as an alternative to traditional artificial redds.
5. Constraints: Direct egg planting may not be suitable for all systems, especially those with low sediment levels or stable flow rates. Additionally, it requires careful management and timing to ensure optimal spawning conditions.
