  "backgroundRationale": "<p>The sampling design for fish status and trend monitoring in the Wenatchee, Entiat and Methow is based on a Generalized Random-Tessellation Sampling design with an annual panel of 25 sites structured to distribute sampling effort in space (Stevens and Olsen 2004). These 25 sites are co-located with the habitat monitoring annual panel sites proposed under the CHaMP. Analysis suggests that 25 sites provide good coverage without redundancy (see CHaMP study design). All fish monitoring data will be subjected to standard QA/QC processes and uploaded to a web-based enterprise database (STEM).</p>\r\n",
