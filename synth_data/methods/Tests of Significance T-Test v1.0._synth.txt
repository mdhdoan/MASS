2. Abstract: Parametric tests are essential methods used to compare means of two or more groups and determine if they are significantly different. These tests include the independent t-test, paired t-test, and mean t-test (one-sample t-test). The choice of test depends on the number of samples and the availability of population parameters. While parametric tests are widely used in fisheries management, the mean t-test is rarely applied due to the scarcity of known true population parameters.
3. Description: Parametric tests are a class of statistical methods that assume a normal distribution of data and enable comparisons between means of two or more groups. The independent t-test, also called the Student's t-test, compares the means of two independent samples. The paired (correlated) t-test evaluates the mean difference between two related or matched samples. The mean t-test, or one-sample t-test, is used to compare a sample mean with a known population parameter, but it has limited application in fisheries management due to the rarity of having known true population parameters. A two-sample t-test is used when comparing means of two populations based on samples drawn from each.
4. Target: The primary focus of parametric tests is to identify significant differences between means of one or more groups and help researchers draw conclusions about population parameters by making inferences based on sample data.
5. Constraints: Parametric tests rely on several assumptions, such as normality, equal variances, and independence of observations. Violations of these assumptions may lead to incorrect conclusions, reducing the reliability and validity of the results. Additionally, the mean t-test's limited applicability in fisheries management due to the scarcity of known true population parameters constrains its usefulness compared to other parametric tests.
