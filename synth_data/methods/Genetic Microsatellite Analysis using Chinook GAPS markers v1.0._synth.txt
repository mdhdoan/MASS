2. Abstract: Microsatellites, also known as Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) or short tandem repeats (STRs), are DNA sequences that consist of repeating units of 2-6 base pairs. They are widely used in genetics as molecular markers for various applications such as relatedness/parentage and other population genetic studies. Their co-dominant nature makes them particularly useful for these purposes, as it allows for the identification of heterozygous individuals.
3. Description: Microsatellites are repetitive sequences of DNA that consist of 2-6 base pair units repeated in tandem. They are also known as Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) or short tandem repeats (STRs). These markers are widely used in genetics due to their high polymorphism and co-dominant inheritance pattern, which makes them useful for distinguishing between homozygous and heterozygous individuals. This is particularly valuable in studies of relatedness and parentage, as well as other population genetic analyses.
4. Target: The primary focus of microsatellites is to serve as molecular markers in genetics, aiding in various applications such as relatedness/parentage and other population genetic studies.
5. Constraints: The use of microsatellites as molecular markers has some limitations. For instance, the development of microsatellite markers can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Additionally, the accuracy of microsatellite analysis can be affected by factors such as stuttering and null alleles, which can lead to genotyping errors.
