 1. Keywords: stream type, sinuosity, sediment size, slope, habitat complexity, reach length, Method 7017.
2. Abstract: This method explains how to calculate the sinuosity of a stream, which is an important characteristic related to sediment size and slope. Sinuosity can also create complex habitats, such as backwaters and oxbows. The recommended data collection method for reach length in the field is Method 7017.
3. Description: Sinuosity is a key descriptive characteristic of stream type that is correlated with sediment size and slope. It can also serve as a form of habitat complexity, creating features such as backwaters and oxbows. This method describes how to calculate sinuosity as a function of reach length and the straight line distance between the bottom and top of the reach. The recommended data collection method for reach length in the field is Method 7017.
4. Target: To provide a standardized method for calculating stream sinuosity, which can aid in understanding stream behavior and habitat complexity.
5. Constraints: The accuracy of the calculated sinuosity may be affected by the precision of the data collection methods used, particularly for reach length. It is recommended to use Method 7017 for field data collection. Additionally, the method assumes a certain level of knowledge about stream systems and their characteristics.
