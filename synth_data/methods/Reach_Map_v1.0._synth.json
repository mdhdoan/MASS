  "abstract": " This text describes a method used for creating a \"reach map\" for a site. A reach map is a visual representation that highlights crucial features of the site, which can be useful for locating and relocating the site in future. In most cases, a previously drawn map will be given to the person conducting the site analysis, often on the back of the sampling sheet.\n\nThe necessity of creating a reach map lies in its ability to provide an easily understandable summary of important site features. This can be especially useful when dealing with large or complex sites, as it simplifies the process of relocating the site or sharing information about it with others. By highlighting essential features on a map, critical details are easily identified and communicated, saving time and resources in the long run.\n\nAdditionally, using a previously drawn map as a starting point expedites the process by providing an initial framework for the reach map, reducing the time and effort required to create a detailed and accurate representation of the site.\n\nThere is no code provided in this text."

  "description": " In the given text, the topic revolves around the creation and utilization of a \"reach map\" for describing and locating a site. The term \"reach map\" is likely a graphical representation used to highlight essential features of a site, which will aid in its future relocation. For sites where an earlier map is available, it will be supplied on the reverse side of the sampling sheet.\n\nThis process starts by drawing a reach map to emphasize significant aspects of a given site. The importance of these features is underscored by their role in describing the site's characteristics effectively. These features may include specific points or areas referenced as 'Table 1'. This reach map will serve as an essential tool for relocating the site in future endeavors. In cases where a previously drawn map already exists, it will be supplied with the site sampling sheet for reference during this process."

  "constraints": " Based on the given text, there are no explicit constraints mentioned regarding the method for drawing a reach map. However, the text mentions that \"for most sites a previously drawn map will be provided to you on the back of the site sampling sheet.\" This could be considered an implicit constraint, suggesting that using a pre-existing map is a common practice and should be taken into consideration when creating a new reach map.\n\nTherefore, the constraint can be stated as: \"Use a previously drawn map if available.\"\n\nNo code is provided in the text."
