  "abstractText": "The time period that a juvenile salmonid emerges from its spawning nest has a direct effect on its potential survival. Therefore rate of development is subject to strong natural selection pressures. Fish that emerge early will encounter little competition for territorial sites but may experience low food availability. Conversely, late emerging individuals will have to compete with prior residents and may be forced to make lengthy downstream migrations in order to find open habitat areas for rearing. In most production hatcheries fish are not allowed to emerge from their incubation devices. Moreover, when they are introduced into juvenile rearing areas the capacity to find and hold a feeding territory is not relevant. Hence, selection pressures that have finely tuned when natural-origin fish emerge are greatly relaxed in hatcheries. We are uncertain how or whether developmental rate will be affected by domestication. The goal of this evaluation is to determine if exposure to incubation and early rearing conditions in a hatchery will alter the rate that embryos develop into free-swimming fry. Our objective is to compare the emergence timing of fish produced from parents with little or no previous hatchery exposure (wild or supplementation origin) and fish with substantial hatchery exposure (hatchery origin) under identical incubation conditions. Differences observed will be inferred to be the result of domestication selection.",
