  "abstractText": "For private fishing vessels and guides/charters that are not associated with a local storefront or booking office, effort counts are made using one of two general methods:  bar crossing counts or trailer/slip counts.  In making the counts, the ORBS employees must make some judgment calls related to whether certain boats are on commercial fishing trips, and whether sail boats are pleasure cruising or are possibly on a fishing trip.   Commercial boats and sail boats are sorted out by examining the vessel with binoculars as it crosses the count location for signs of recreational fishing vs. other activities i.e. dip net or fishing rods in view on a sailboat, or several people and angling gear on a commercial boat.  Some of the smallest commercial boats that are easily confused with recreational boats are added to a list for boat count reference use, and local ORBS sampling staff are familiarized with those vessels.",
