 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the keywords I've identified from the text body:

1. Spawning fish abundance
2. Redds per kilometer
3. Spawners per kilometer
4. Descriptive measures
5. Species-dependent

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract:
The text describes a method for detecting and measuring the abundance of spawning fish. This is an important task in fisheries management, as it helps to assess the health and productivity of fish populations. The method involves counting either the number of redds (nests) or spawners (adult fish) per kilometer of stream or river habitat. Which measure is used depends on the species being studied. This approach is shown to be more descriptive than other measures, as it takes into account the density and distribution of spawning adults or nests.
3. Description:
The text explains that both the number of redds per kilometer and the number of spawners per kilometer can be used to detect the abundance of spawning fish. The choice between these two measures depends on the species being studied, as some species build visible nests (redds) while others do not. Redds are often easier to count than individual spawners, especially in turbid or murky waters. On the other hand, counting spawners may be more accurate for species that do not build visible nests or that build nests under rocks or other structures.
4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to provide a descriptive measure of the abundance and distribution of spawning fish, in order to inform fisheries management decisions.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is that it may be difficult or impossible to count redds or spawners for some species, especially those that spawn in deep water or in remote locations. Additionally, environmental factors such as water flow and sedimentation can affect the visibility and detectability of both redds and spawners. Finally, the choice of measure (redds vs. spawners) may be limited by the available data and expertise for a particular species.
