  "abstractText": "Underwater videography mapping surveys identify the composition of the substrate to determine particle size characteristics and spatial variability of sediment. The survey data can be used to compare a restoration site before and after treatment, explain the surficial sediment facies on a reach scale, and monitor sediment processes on a long-term basis to document scour(erosion) or fill (aggradation).",
