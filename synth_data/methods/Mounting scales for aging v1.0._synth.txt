2. Abstract: The necessity of accurately estimating the age of a fish is highlighted in this method through the examination of fine ridges on a scale called circuli. This allows for the determination of various biological parameters needed to demonstrate Endangered Species Unit/Distinct Population Segment (ESU/DPS) viability, as recommended by NOAA. The process includes collecting scale samples and documenting adult abundance, age distribution, sex ratio, length, and run timing at the population, major population grouping, and ESU/DPS levels for each listed species.
3. Description: A common method used to estimate the age of a fish involves examining the circuli on a scale, which are laid down in a circular pattern as the fish grows. This provides a way to determine the age composition of a fish population by collecting samples and analyzing their scales. NOAA has established guidelines for demonstrating ESU/DPS viability that require annual documentation of various biological parameters. These include adult abundance, age distribution, sex ratio, length, and run timing, which are all crucial factors in understanding the health and sustainability of a fish population. Detailed instructions for this method are provided to ensure accurate and consistent results.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to estimate the age composition of a fish population and provide the necessary data to demonstrate ESU/DPS viability, as per NOAA guidelines.
5. Constraints: The main constraint for this method is the need for access to a representative sample of fish from the population being studied. Additionally, the accuracy of the results may be affected by variations in the quality and condition of the scales collected.
