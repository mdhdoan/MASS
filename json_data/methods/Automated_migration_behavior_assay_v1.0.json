  "abstractText": "During smoltification a behavioral change occurs; smolts tend to become less territorial and increasingly migratory especially at night (Greenstreet 1992). We measured this migratory urge using a swimming assay similar to previous assays performed on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) (Spencer et al.2010, Zydlewski et al. 2005) and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) smolts (Sykes and Shrimpton, 2010). This method is appropriate for species of juvenile salmonids undergoing smoltification.",
