  "abstractText": "Creel surveys are conducted annually on the Hood River to estimate the non-tribal harvest of summer and winter steelhead, spring and fall Chinook salmon, and coho salmon.Harvest estimates are reported according to run year, and in the case of steelhead that period spans two calendar years. Harvest data are used to determine if established annual harvest goals are achieved and to refine escapement to natural production. In season harvest estimates allow subbasin managers to make changes to the fishery to balance escapement, broodstock, and harvest goals of hatchery fish.",
