  "abstract": " This text outlines a protocol for monitoring restoration projects that involve both floodplain and bank stabilization actions under BPA's Action Effectiveness Monitoring Program. The combined protocol includes tasks to be carried out before the project starts and for ten years after completion.\n\nThe method involves several steps aimed at understanding the pre-project topography, measuring habitat areas and types, determining slow water habitat proportion, evaluating river complexity indices, analyzing floodplain area to channel area ratio, and assessing variation in residual depth and channel size. Additionally, it includes tasks to determine inundated floodplain area, habitat type proportions, channel migration rate, secondary production, fish abundance, fish species presence, and developing a predictive model for off-channel habitat inundation.\n\nThe necessity of this method lies in the fact that combining two existing protocols facilitates efficient monitoring of restoration projects with both floodplain and bank stabilization project actions. By collecting detailed data on various aspects of the river system before and after the project, we can effectively assess the impact of the project on the ecosystem, identify any changes or improvements, and make informed decisions for future restoration efforts.\n\nHere's a simple code snippet to generate a list of tasks in the protocol:\n\n```python\ntasks = {\n    \"Pre-Project\": [\n        \"Determine the pre-project topography of the floodplain and channel bed\",\n        \"Map habitat area by habitat type\"\n    ],\n    \"Post-Project (Years -2 to 10)\": [\n        \"Determine the proportion of slow water habitat at various flows through mapping or modeling\",\n        \"Determine the value of the River Complexity Index, braid-channel ratio, and sinuosity\",\n        \"Determine the ratio of floodplain area to channel area\",\n        \"Determine the variation (standard deviation) in residual depth and channel size\",\n        \"Determine inundated floodplain area\",\n        \"Determine the proportion of each habitat type relative to total area\",\n        \"Determine the channel migration rate\",\n        \"Determine secondary production (benthic macroinvertebrates)\",\n        \"Determine the relative fish abundance by habitat, season, species and life stage\",\n        \"Determine the presence of fish species by season\",\n        \"Develop predictive model for inundation of off-channel habitat\"\n    ]\n}\nprint(\"Tasks to be carried out:\")\nfor phase, tasks_list in tasks.items():\n    print(f\"\\n{phase}: {', '.join(tasks_list)}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the following:\n\n```\nTasks to be carried out:\nPre-Project: Determine the pre-project topography of the floodplain and channel bed, Map habitat area by habitat type\nPost-Project (Years -2 to 10): Determine the proportion of slow water habitat at various flows through mapping or modeling, Determine the value of the River Complexity Index, braid-channel ratio, and sinuosity, Determine the ratio of floodplain area to channel area, Determine the variation (standard deviation) in residual depth and channel size, Determine inundated floodplain area, Determine the proportion of each habitat type relative to total area, Determine the channel migration rate, Determine secondary production (benthic macroinvertebrates), Determine the relative fish abundance by habitat, season, species and life stage, Determine the presence of fish species by season, Develop predictive model for inundation of off-channel habitat\n```"

  "value": " The text describes a combined protocol under BPA's Action Effectiveness Monitoring Program for monitoring restoration projects that involve both floodplain and bank stabilization project actions. This protocol includes various tasks to determine the pre-project topography, habitat area and types, slow water habitat, River Complexity Index, channel migration rate, secondary production, fish abundance, and fish species presence, among others.\n\nHere's why investing money into this protocol is worthwhile:\n\n1.

  "description": " This text describes a protocol for monitoring restoration projects that involve both floodplain and bank stabilization project actions, under BPA's Action Effectiveness Monitoring Program. The goal is to combine the existing Protocol for Monitoring Off-Channel/Floodplain Projects (ID: 2231) and Protocol for Monitoring Bank Stabilization Projects (ID: 2232).\n\nThe protocol includes several steps that need to be taken before, during, and after project implementation. First, the pre-project topography of the floodplain and channel bed must be determined in years -2 and -1. This involves mapping habitat area by habitat type, including turbulent, non-turbulent, and edge habitats, as well as determining the proportion of slow water habitat at various flows using a threshold of 0.15m/s (Beechie 2005).\n\nAdditionally, several hydrological measures need to be determined: the River Complexity Index (Brown 2002), braid-channel ratio, sinuosity, ratio of floodplain area to channel area, and variation in residual depth and channel size. Inundated floodplain area is also calculated by determining the inundated floodplain area (length²)/channel length for years -2, -1, 1, 3, 5, and 10.\n\nThe proportion of each habitat type relative to the total area needs to be determined for years -2, -1, 1, 3, 5, and 10. Channel migration rate is also measured between survey years or with aerial photos for years -2, -1, 1, 3, 5, and 10. Secondary production by habitat type (benthic macroinvertebrates) and the relative fish abundance by habitat, season, species, and life stage are also determined for Years -2, -1, 1, 3, 5, and 10.\n\nFinally, a predictive model for inundation of off-channel habitat is developed for years 1, 3, 5, and 10.\n\nIn summary, this protocol outlines the steps required to monitor restoration projects with both floodplain and bank stabilization project actions under BPA's Action Effectiveness Monitoring Program. This includes determining pre-project topography, several hydrological measures, habitat area and production, fish abundance, and developing a predictive model for inundation of off-channel habitat."
