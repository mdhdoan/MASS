2. Abstract:
Beach and pole seining is a method used to capture fish in a variety of habitats, including rivers, estuaries, lakes, reservoirs, and marine environments. This technique involves using a seine net that is dragged along the bottom by boats or people wading in shallow water. Beach and pole seining is an effective way to sample fish populations because it allows for relatively large areas to be covered in a short amount of time, while minimizing stress and harm to the captured fish. However, the suitability of this method depends on several factors, including habitat type, water conditions, fish species, time of year and day, net design, and the specific objectives of the study.
3. Description:
Beach and pole seining is a method that involves using a long, weighted net to capture fish in a variety of habitats. The net is typically made of mesh and has lead weights sewn into the bottom hem to help it sink to the bottom. The top of the net is held up by floats, which keep the net upright and allow it to be towed or dragged along the bottom.

This method can be used in both shallow and deep water, although it is most effective in relatively shallow water with few obstructions. Beach and pole seining is also more effective when fish are in high concentrations and for species that are less likely to outswim the net. However, in some cases, highly mobile species such as adult salmon can be captured using this method.

When using beach and pole seining, it is important to consider several factors that can affect selectivity and capture efficiency. These factors include habitat type, water conditions (e.g., current velocity, depth), fish species and life stage, time of year and day, net design, and the specific objectives of the study. For example, sites with irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, or dense stands of aquatic vegetation may not be suitable for seining due to net snagging or lifting and reduced fish retention.

To improve the effectiveness of beach and pole seining, it is important to consider these factors in study design and implementation. This can include underwater observation and calibration studies to optimize net design and deployment techniques. It is also important to handle captured fish carefully to minimize stress and harm. This can be achieved by keeping the bunt of the seine in water and quickly moving fish to a holding container if necessary.

4. Target:
The primary target of beach and pole seining is to capture and sample fish populations in a variety of habitats while minimizing stress and harm to the captured fish. This method can be used for both quantitative and qualitative studies, depending on the specific objectives of the study.
5. Constraints:
There are several constraints to using beach and pole seining as a method for capturing and sampling fish populations. These include:
* Habitat suitability: Sites with irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, or dense stands of aquatic vegetation may not be suitable for seining due to net snagging or lifting and reduced fish retention.
* Water conditions: Current velocity and depth can influence site selection and choice of net design.
* Fish species and life stage: Some fish species and life stages may be more difficult to capture using this method, while others may be overrepresented in the sample.
* Time of year and day: Seasonal and diurnal variations in fish behavior and abundance can affect the effectiveness of beach and pole seining.
* Net design and deployment techniques: The size and design of the net, as well as the technique used to deploy it, can affect selectivity and capture efficiency.
* Personnel and equipment costs: The cost of gear, boats, and personnel can range from relatively inexpensive to modest, depending on the scope and frequency of sampling.
