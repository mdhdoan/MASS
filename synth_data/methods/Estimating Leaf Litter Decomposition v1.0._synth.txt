2. Abstract: Leaf litter decomposition is a crucial process in freshwater ecosystems that provides energy and nutrients. This process is influenced by both biotic communities such as fungi, microbes, and macroinvertebrates, as well as abiotic factors like temperature. The rate of leaf litter decomposition can serve as an indicator of ecosystem health. By examining the link between riparian vegetation characteristics and aquatic invertebrate and microbial organism activity, leaf breakdown has the potential to be an ideal measure for assessing ecosystem health.
3. Description: Leaf litter is a vital source of energy and nutrients for freshwater ecosystems. The decomposition rates of leaf litter have been used as indicators of ecosystem health, reflecting the state and functioning of these ecosystems. The biotic community, including fungi, microbes, and macroinvertebrates, plays a significant role in decomposing leaf litter, breaking it down into smaller particles and releasing essential nutrients. Abiotic factors like temperature also impact leaf litter decomposition rates. In this context, temperature influences the metabolic rates of decomposer organisms, affecting their ability to break down leaf litter. Additionally, there is a strong correlation between riparian vegetation characteristics and aquatic invertebrate and microbial organism activity. Leaf breakdown may serve as an ideal measure because it bridges the gap between riparian vegetation properties and the activities of these essential ecosystem components. Young et al. (2008) emphasize this potential, highlighting the value of further research in this area for a better understanding of freshwater ecosystem health.
4. Target: The primary focus is to establish leaf litter decomposition as an effective indicator of freshwater ecosystem health by examining its link with riparian vegetation and aquatic invertebrate and microbial organism activity.
5. Constraints: Further research is required to validate the use of leaf litter decomposition as a reliable and consistent indicator of freshwater ecosystem health across various environmental conditions and geographical locations.
