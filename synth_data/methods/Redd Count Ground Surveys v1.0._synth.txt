2. Abstract:
Redd count surveys are a crucial method for monitoring and assessing fish populations in streams. These surveys involve walking along the streambed and counting the number of redds, which are areas where fish have deposited their eggs. The method described here involves conducting surveys either as single pass or multiple-pass surveys, with the latter being preferred in intensively monitored streams. This is because multiple-pass surveys minimize enumeration errors in heavily spawned areas, provide information on spawn timing, and generate more carcasses, which improves the biological representation of the overall return. The method emphasizes conducting surveys during good weather conditions when redd visibility is optimal and avoiding overcast days, rain, or poor water clarity.
3. Description:
Redd count surveys are a standard method used to monitor fish populations in streams. The method involves one or two people walking along the streambed in an upstream or downstream direction, counting the number of redds they observe. The number of people required for the survey depends on the width of the stream, with smaller streams surveyed by one person and larger streams surveyed by two or more people. Surveys are typically conducted from mid-morning until late afternoon on clear, sunny days when redd visibility is good. Stream transects can be surveyed once (single pass) or multiple times (multiple-pass surveys), with the latter being preferred in intensively monitored streams. Multiple-pass surveys allow surveyors to observe the progression of redd construction and minimize enumeration errors in heavily spawned areas. They also provide information on spawn timing and generate more carcasses, which improves the biological representation of the overall return.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to monitor and assess fish populations in streams by counting the number of redds.
5. Constraints:
There are several constraints to this method, including the need for good weather conditions to ensure optimal redd visibility and the availability of trained surveyors to conduct the surveys. Additionally, the method requires a significant amount of time and resources, particularly for multiple-pass surveys. Finally, the accuracy of the survey results may be compromised by factors such as water clarity or overhead light conditions, which can affect the observer's ability to detect redds.
