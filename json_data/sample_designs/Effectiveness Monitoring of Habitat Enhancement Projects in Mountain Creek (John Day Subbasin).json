  "description": "<p>Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs (CTWS) &nbsp;has implemented numerous Habitat Enhancement projects within Mountain Creek. &nbsp;In 2013, CTWS&nbsp;began structuring an effectiveness monitoring program to document habitat changes due to restoration work. &nbsp;Current and proposed habitat enhancement areas were included in the effectiveness monitoring design. &nbsp;The original design was planned using a GRTS-based approach, but after initial sampling in 2013 the design was changed to a census-based approach. &nbsp;The original GRTS sites were used in sequential order (downstream to upstream order) and sampled in a census-based approach, overlapping start and end transects using the 2013 CHaMP protocol. &nbsp;Sampling of Habitat Enhancement areas was originally designed to capture habitat before and after restoration. All sites were assigned to an &#39;annual&#39; panel to provide flexibility in sampling around restoration implementation. &nbsp;Sampling ideally follows the before and 1,3, 5&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The effectiveness monitoring design for the habitat enhancement areas were paired with a status and trend monitoring design covering the rest of the Mountain Creek watershed. A separate sampling design describes this sampling approach. &nbsp;Both effectiveness and status and trend monitoring designs for Mountain Creek were designed to work in tandem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
