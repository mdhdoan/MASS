  "description": "<p>CHaMP&nbsp;is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010).&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;salmonids&nbsp;and/or their habitat. The implementation of&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;56.3,&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;57, and&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;3.&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel, at least 9 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;status and trends domain includes the&nbsp;mainstem&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;and a short distance up several tributaries,&nbsp;targetting&nbsp;the Chinook population and covering the most important domain of the Steelhead (Snake River&nbsp;DPS)&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;River Population.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;will receive a significant amount of treatment over the coming years through restoration work by the Snake River Salmon Recovery Board; a system of treatment/control groups has been set up yielding a set of tiny treatment/control strata as part of the&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;study design.&nbsp; The design splits the sampling into these paired groups and to&nbsp;&ldquo;mainstem&rdquo;&nbsp;and &ldquo;tributary&rdquo; groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The standard valley class stratification was abandoned for&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;partly because all sites fell into the&nbsp;depositional&nbsp;stratum, and partly because of the treatment-control design imposed.&nbsp; As well, the private/public split was abandoned given the small number of choices in most of the treatment/control strata and the small target frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2017 sample design notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>8/4/17: CBW05583-519039 was moved from RP 2 Trt Reach 8-Treatment back to Annual Trt Reach 8-Treatment and block counts were adjusted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-339839 was moved from RP3 Treatment Reach 2 control back to Annual Treatment Reach 2 Control and block counts were adjusted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These sites were previously moved to RP blocks due to reduced 2017 funding but there is now funding to sample them. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7/28/17:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>WDFW requests sampling of all sites along the mainstem. &nbsp;This has triggered shifting of 4 sites to the RP1 panel to allow sampling in 2017. &nbsp;These will be added to a new block and refiled at the end of the year back into their native panels.

To maximize the ability to determine the effectiveness of restoration actions, the domain of inference in the&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;River to include only the spring Chinook domain as defined in the&nbsp;subbasin&nbsp;plan (SRSRB&nbsp;2011). This restricted domain of inference was established because the focus of restoration efforts in the&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;River are targeted at spring Chinook (ADEQ&nbsp;2011) and the&nbsp;SRSRB&nbsp;is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of habitat restoration as part of the&nbsp;BiOP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment and control areas were used as&nbsp;strata.&nbsp;This ensured&nbsp;that&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;sites were allocated in treatment and control areas throughout the domain of inference. This approach will allow for effectiveness monitoring of the restoration actions. A small sampling effort was put into &#39;mainstem&#39; and &#39;tributary&#39; strata for status and trends monitoring of&nbsp;non-restoration areas within the domain. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tucannon&nbsp;Frame File:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://isemp.egnyte.com/h-s/20140327/CmDZF8xoKt\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">TucannonFrameFile.zip</a></p>\r\n",
