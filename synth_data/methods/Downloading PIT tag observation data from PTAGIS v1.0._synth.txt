2. Abstract: PTAGIS is a regional database for storing and managing data on PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) tagged fish in the Columbia River Basin. The system helps track fish migration and provides valuable insights into their behavior, supporting conservation efforts and management of fisheries resources. With advanced reporting functionality, users can query specific data on marking, recapturing, releasing, mortality, and detection of fish.
3. Description: PTAGIS (www.ptagis.org) is a regional database that stores PIT tagged fish data and their detection histories within the Columbia River Basin. The system hosts data from 40 different agencies and is administered by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, with funding from Bonneville Power Administration. PIT tags are used to monitor fish migration at dams, hatcheries, and in-stream sites. Contributors use specialized software provided by PTAGIS for submitting and collecting tagging and interrogation data. Users can download complete records of individual or groups of fish, tracking their journey from tagging to upstream tributaries or hatcheries. The Advanced Reporting feature enables users to query specific information on marking, recapturing, releasing, mortality, and detection events for the fish in the system.
4. Target: PTAGIS primarily aims to facilitate efficient management of fisheries resources by providing a centralized platform for storing, managing, and analyzing PIT tagged fish data.
5. Constraints: Although PTAGIS offers extensive features and capabilities, some limitations may include reliance on the availability and functionality of external software for data submission, potential issues with data accuracy or consistency from contributing agencies, as well as resource constraints in terms of maintenance, updates, and support for the system.
