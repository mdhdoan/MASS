2. Abstract: This method outlines the process of transporting and planting live stakes for riparian restoration projects. Live stakes are collected and stored in cold storage before being transported to the site in batches to ensure a representative mix of cottonwood and willow species. A motorized auger is used to drill holes within identified riparian areas, taking into account soil moisture and depth requirements. Each hole is backfilled after a live stake is planted and relevant information such as the species, date of planting, and location are recorded for future reference.
3. Description: The method begins with the preparation of live stakes, which involves transporting them from cold storage to the restoration site in batches, providing a representative mix of cottonwood and willow species. The batches should arrive 24 hours before planting to allow for soaking in water prior to planting. Using a motorized auger, holes are drilled within the riparian areas identified in the planting maps, taking into account the stream bed base elevation and wet/moist soil conditions. The holes should be spaced roughly 6-10 feet apart. For each plant, the soil at the bottom of the drilled hole is confirmed to be wet or moist before inserting a live stake that has been cut at a 45-degree angle just below the bottom-most node and a 90-degree angle approximately 22 cm above the ground. The soil is then backfilled until it is level with the surrounding ground. The species, date of planting, and location are recorded for each live stake planted.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide clear instructions for the preparation, planting, and recording keeping of live stakes for riparian restoration projects.
5. Constraints: The success of this method depends on several constraints, including the availability of healthy live stakes, appropriate soil moisture levels, correct drilling depth, and accurate record-keeping. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that the planting process is carried out in a timely and organized manner to maximize the chances of successful establishment and growth of the cottonwood and willow species.
