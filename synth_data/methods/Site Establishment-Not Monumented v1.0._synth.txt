2. Abstract: This method outlines the creation of non-monumented sites, which differ from traditional sites as they lack permanent physical markers but contain precise coordinate information. The importance of establishing such sites lies in their association with site names, watersheds, subbasins, and streamnames, along with latitude, longitude, and start/stop coordinates if data is collected at multiple places within a site. This method ensures accurate site identification, classification, and mapping without the need for physical markers.

3. Description: Non-monumented sites are a type of geographical site that relies on coordinate information instead of physical markers (e.g., rebar, bearing trees, reference locations) for identification. These sites must have established site names, latitudes, longitudes, watersheds, subbasins, and streamnames associated with them. When data is collected at multiple places within a site, it becomes necessary to record start and stop coordinates or site lengths for accurate mapping and analysis. This method provides clear guidelines on how to create non-monumented sites and ensures that relevant information is attached to these sites, making them easily identifiable in databases and geographical information systems.

4. Target: Establishing and managing non-monumented geographic sites with precise coordinate information.

5. Constraints: The main constraint of this method is the reliance on accurate coordinate data for site identification. Inaccurate or missing coordinate information may lead to errors in site mapping and analysis. Additionally, since these sites do not have physical markers, proper documentation and record-keeping are essential to ensure accurate site identification and retrieval in databases or geographical information systems.
