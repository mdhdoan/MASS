 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the five highly relevant keywords that I came up with based on the text body you provided:

1. eDNA (environmental DNA)
2. Contamination avoidance
3. Field sampling
4. Sources of contamination
5. Water exposure

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract:
The accuracy of eDNA results is crucial in many fields such as environmental monitoring and species identification. To ensure accurate results, it is essential to prevent contamination of field samples. Contamination can come from various sources including water, hands, clothes, equipment, and the surrounding environment that have been exposed to targeted organisms or DNA. By following best practices for collecting and handling eDNA samples in the field, researchers can minimize the risk of contamination and improve the reliability of their results.

3. Description:
The text describes the importance of avoiding contamination of eDNA field samples to ensure accurate results. The primary sources of contamination are anything that has come into contact with the targeted organisms, particularly water that may have been exposed to targeted DNA. In the field, potential sources of contamination include hands, clothes, waders, boats, vehicles, used sampling equipment, and the surrounding environment. These sources can introduce foreign DNA or inhibit the detection of target DNA, leading to inaccurate results. To prevent contamination, researchers must take precautions such as wearing clean gear, using sterilized equipment, and avoiding contact with potential sources of contamination.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to avoid contamination of eDNA field samples to ensure accurate results in environmental monitoring and species identification.

5. Constraints:
Some constraints for this method include the need for careful handling and storage of eDNA samples, the potential for false positives or negatives due to contamination or inhibition, and the time and cost involved in collecting and analyzing eDNA samples. Additionally, researchers must be aware of local regulations and guidelines for eDNA sampling and analysis.
