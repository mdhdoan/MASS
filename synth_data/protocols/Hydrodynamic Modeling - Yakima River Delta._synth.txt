 Sure, I'd be happy to help label the topics for your text body! Here are my suggestions based on the provided text:

1. Abstract:
* Topic: Necessity and solution of the protocol
* Keywords: phased approach, operational scenarios, water movement, non-native fish predators, Yakima River Delta, McNary Reservoir areas

2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes:
* Values: Importance of reducing non-native fish predator recruitment in the Yakima River Delta and McNary Reservoir areas
* Problem Statement: Need to determine operational scenarios that will produce water movement characteristics to reduce non-native fish predator recruitment
* Desired Outcomes: Reduction of non-native fish predator recruitment through specific operational scenarios

3. Description:
* Topic: More detailed description of the text body
* Keywords: constraints, hydroelectric system, water surface elevation changes, Predator Recruitment Reduction Team

4. Objectives:
* Objective: Determine operations necessary to displace larval non-native predators
* Summary of Solution Coverage: The protocol aims to cover the entire problem statement by providing a solution for reducing non-native fish predator recruitment through specific operational scenarios
* Keywords: determine operations, displace larval non-native predators

5. Target:
* Primary focus or goal of the protocol: Reducing non-native fish predator recruitment in the Yakima River Delta and McNary Reservoir areas

6. Constraints:
* The constraints for the current protocol include understanding the constraints of the hydroelectric system and factors associated with water surface elevation changes, which have been discussed and researched by the Predator Recruitment Reduction Team.
