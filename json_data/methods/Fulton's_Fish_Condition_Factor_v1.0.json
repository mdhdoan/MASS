  "abstractText": "Physical habitat alterations that affect temperature, current flow, food availability, and related factors are thought to have a major impact on the growth and health of juvenile salmon (Fresh et al., 2005). For all salmonid species, Fultons condition factor (K) (Fulton 1902; Ricker 1975) iscalculated as an indicator of fish health and fitness. The heavier the fish at a given length, the larger the factor and therefore, the better the condition (Ricker1975).",
