It applies to waded streams. This method requires measurement of the associatedphysical and chemical environmental variables described in other methods within this protocol.Three persons perform this activity: an electrofisher operator, a dip netter, and third person whomonitors and processes the animals collected. The netter should always be limited to 1 personfor consistency. Field supervisors and crew members must be trained prior to electrofishing. For fishing inwaters containing listed salmon or steelhead, the federal government (NOAA, 2000) hasspecialrequirements for field supervisors and crew members.",
