2. Abstract: This method details the use of Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags to assess the status of white sturgeon in the impounded section of the Columbia River Basin upstream of Bonneville Dam. Since 1996, up to 7,654 white sturgeon have been marked with PIT tags during each stock assessment study. The recapture rates of these tagged fish have ranged from 56 to 630 individuals. This method provides a valuable tool for monitoring and managing the white sturgeon population in this region.
3. Description: The text outlines a method used to assess the status of white sturgeon in the Columbia River Basin upstream of Bonneville Dam. Since 1996, up to 7,654 white sturgeon have been marked with PIT tags during each stock assessment study. These tags provide a unique identifier for each fish and allow researchers to track their movements and survival rates. The number of recaptures of these tagged fish has ranged from 56 to 630 individuals, providing valuable data on the population dynamics of white sturgeon in this region. This method is important for monitoring the health and abundance of the white sturgeon population, as well as informing management decisions to ensure their long-term sustainability.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a tool for monitoring and managing the white sturgeon population in the impounded section of the Columbia River Basin upstream of Bonneville Dam.
5. Constraints: One constraint of this method is that it relies on the recapture of tagged fish, which may be affected by factors such as fish behavior, migration patterns, and fishing pressure. Additionally, the effectiveness of this method may be limited by the availability of resources for conducting stock assessment studies and monitoring programs.
