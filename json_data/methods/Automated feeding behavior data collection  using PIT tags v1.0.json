  "abstractText": "Aspects of feeding behavior can be directly correlated with growth rate in fishes. Hatchery rearing of salmonids can cause feeding behavior to diverge from that of salmonids feeding in rivers. For example, hatchery trout have a greater propensity to feed at the surface because food is introduced in the raceways and culture tanks from the water surface. In rivers the majority of food items are distributed below the water surface. We used strategically placed PIT tag interrogators at the surface and bottom of hatchery rearing vessels to record feeding behavior of juvenile salmonids implanted with PIT tags. The data collected will be analyzed to see if individual growth rates are correlated with feeding behavior.",
