  "abstractText": "During the mid-2000s, increased predation created by a rapid expansion of the lake trout population became a limiting factor for kokanee. In response to predation concerns, actions were taken to evaluate predator reduction strategies and eventually an aggressive predator removal program was implemented in 2006 aimed at collapsing the lake trout population and temporarily reducing the rainbow trout population. A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used. Gill netting for mature lake trout can be especially productive during the spawning period. This method describes how we use mobile and stationary telemetry to document lake trout movements and distribution patterns, especially during the spawning period.",
