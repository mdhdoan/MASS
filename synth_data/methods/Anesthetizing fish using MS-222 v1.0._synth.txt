2. Abstract: MS-222 (Tricaine mesylate) is a commonly used anesthetic for fish in various research and handling activities. Its effectiveness depends on factors like temperature and fish density. The ideal concentration range is 50-100 parts per million, but it should be adjusted based on the time it takes for a fish to lose equilibrium. MS-222 can decrease water pH, which may be harmful to fish, so sodium bicarbonate is used to buffer the solution and maintain a neutral pH range of 6.5-7.5.
3. Description: The text discusses MS-222 (Tricaine mesylate), also known as Tricaine methanesulfonate or TMS, which is commonly utilized for anesthetizing fish in situations such as data collection, physiological studies, tag implantation, and other procedures requiring immobilization during handling. The effectiveness of MS-222 as an anesthetic can be influenced by several factors, including temperature and fish density. Research suggests that the optimal concentration for this anesthetic is between 50 and 100 parts per million. However, it is crucial to adjust the anesthesia concentration based on the time required for a fish to lose equilibrium, ensuring proper dosage and avoiding unnecessary stress or harm. MS-222 has high solubility in water but can cause a significant decrease in pH, leading to increased acidity and potential toxicity for fish. To counteract this effect, sodium bicarbonate is added to the solution in equal amounts to buffer the pH range between 6.5 and 7.5, ensuring a safe environment for the fish during anesthesia.
4. Target: The primary goal of using MS-222 (Tricaine mesylate) as an anesthetic for fish is to facilitate various research and handling activities while minimizing stress and harm to the animals.
5. Constraints: When using MS-222, it's crucial to consider factors like temperature, fish density, and proper concentration adjustment based on equilibrium loss time to ensure effective anesthesia without causing unnecessary stress or toxicity due to pH imbalances. The use of sodium bicarbonate is necessary to maintain a safe pH range during the anesthetic process.
