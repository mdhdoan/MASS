  "abstractText": "Monitor the conditon of fish species in fisheris surveys. Condition has been know to be ametric used to understand the health of a fish or a fish population. Tradionally Fulton condition factors have been used to caluculate condition. However, amoung species this can vary widely, due to allometric growth, and only allowed a good comparison of fish of similar lengths (Wege and Anderson 1978). Using relative weight avoids these problems. In order to calculate Wr for your selected species you need to use a precaluated Wsequation. Each species has it's own Ws equation that has been created in the literature.Wsis calculated using a wide range of individual populationsof a specific species throughout a wide geography (Murphy et al. 1990; Blackwell et al. 2000; Bister et al. 2000).",
