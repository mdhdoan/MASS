"The Pacific Lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus), an anadromous species in the Pacific Northwest, has experienced significant declines in abundance throughout its range, including the Columbia Basin. The Columbia River Treaty Tribes initiated the ""Tribal Pacific Lamprey Restoration Plan for the Columbia Basin"" in response to these concerns, highlighting the need for improved monitoring and regional restoration efforts. The ""Conservation Agreement for Pacific Lamprey"" further emphasized the poorly understood population substructure as a critical uncertainty in designing restoration strategies. Traditional tagging methods are limited for lamprey due to their small size during extended larval and juvenile life stages. Genetic analysis emerges as a viable alternative, utilizing the animal's genotype as a natural ""tag"" for species identification, assessing population structure, and conducting parentage analysis. The lack of significant genetic differentiation allows for adult translocation to supplement populations without disrupting genetic substructure, a strategy employed by the Umatilla, Yakama, and Nez Perce Tribes. To enhance adaptive management, the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC) developed a standardized suite of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA markers. This effort resulted in a panel of SNPs for fluidigm 96-SNP microarrays, enabling species identification, understanding physiology, calculating effective spawners, and evaluating the life history of lampreys. The CRITFC RM&E Program incorporates these SNPs to qualitatively and quantitatively assess productivity and life history characteristics at various life stages, supporting regional lamprey projects and advancing conservation efforts."

Population Decline: The Pacific Lamprey, particularly in the Columbia Basin, is facing significant declines in abundance. Challenges in Monitoring: Traditional tagging methods are impractical due to the small size of lamprey during crucial life stages, necessitating alternative approaches. Genetic Homogeneity: Despite apparent genetic homogeneity, the text acknowledges the need for a genetic approach for comprehensive understanding and conservation strategies. Need for Understanding Population Substructure: The critical gap in understanding the population substructure of Pacific Lamprey is identified as a challenge in designing effective restoration strategies.	"Effective Restoration Strategies: The development of the ""Tribal Pacific Lamprey Restoration Plan"" and the ""Conservation Agreement"" aims to design and implement effective restoration strategies. Innovative Genetic Approach: By leveraging genetic markers and microarrays, the goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional tagging methods, enabling species identification and detailed analysis of lamprey populations. Population Supplementation: Exploring the possibility of adult translocation as a strategy to supplement declining populations, as seen in initiatives by the Umatilla, Yakama, and Nez Perce Tribes. Adaptive Management: The incorporation of genetic analyses, especially the development of standardized SNP DNA markers, aims to enhance adaptive management of regional lamprey projects. Collaborative Conservation Impact: The collaborative efforts of various tribes and organizations, as seen in translocation programs and monitoring projects, are expected to contribute to the restoration and monitoring of local lamprey populations."	"To address these challenges, proactive restoration plans, such as the ""Tribal Pacific Lamprey Restoration Plan for the Columbia Basin"" and the ""Conservation Agreement for Pacific Lamprey,"" were developed. The limitations of traditional tagging methods led to the adoption of a genetic approach, leveraging the fish's genotype as a natural ""tag."" The introduction of standardized SNP DNA markers, facilitated by the CRITFC project, and implemented in fluidigm 96-SNP microarrays, provides a consistent and comprehensive tool for genetic analyses. This solution enables precise species identification, insights into the lamprey's physiology and life history, and critical evaluations of population dynamics at various life stages."

HEP utilizes models that gauge the quality of specific habitats for target wildlife species, relying on key parameters such as shrub height, snag density, or distance to water. The output of HEP is a quantitative evaluation of habitat quality, expressed in terms of Habitat Units (HU), where one acre of optimum habitat equals one HU. This HU accounting system serves as the basis for determining the credit BPA receives for protected lands.	Mitigation Commitment: The protocol underscores BPA's commitment to fulfilling its mitigation obligations as mandated by the Northwest Power Planning Act. Investment in this monitoring approach aligns with BPA's responsibility to address wildlife habitat losses resulting from its activities. Quantifiable Accountability: By employing the HU accounting system, BPA ensures a quantifiable and accountable measure of habitat quality. This approach provides transparency in assessing the impact of the Precious Lands project and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts. 	The challenge lies in the accurate measurement and assessment of habitat quality changes associated with BPA activities, particularly the Precious Lands project. Traditional methods may lack precision and objectivity, necessitating a systematic and standardized approach to ensure credible and reliable results. 	Effective Mitigation: The protocol aims to facilitate effective mitigation by providing a comprehensive and standardized method for measuring habitat quality changes. This, in turn, contributes to BPA's broader goal of fulfilling its mitigation commitments under the Northwest Power Planning Act. Credit Accuracy: Through the HU accounting system, the protocol seeks to ensure accurate determination of the credit BPA receives for protected lands. This precision in crediting is crucial for evaluating the success of mitigation efforts and guiding future conservation initiatives.	The Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP) stands as a crucial component of BPA's commitment to wildlife habitat mitigation, as outlined in the Northwest Power Planning Act. The need for a systematic and standardized approach to measure habitat quality changes associated with the Precious Lands project led to the adoption of HEP, a habitat modeling strategy developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This protocol is indispensable for BPA in fulfilling its mitigation obligations. The HEP employs models based on key habitat parameters, providing a quantitative assessment of habitat quality in terms of Habitat Units (HU). The utilization of HUs ensures a clear and accountable measure of habitat quality, aligning with the values of mitigation commitment and quantifiable accountability. Long-term monitoring, based on HEP data collection procedures, goes beyond specific wildlife variables, encompassing aspects like percent microbiotic crust cover and woody debris in different cover types. The surveys conducted under this protocol are designed to assess long-term trends in plant community health, weedy encroachment, and factors limiting wildlife, enabling the identification and monitoring of areas prone to habitat degradation. This comprehensive and standardized approach ensures the effectiveness of mitigation efforts, ultimately contributing to the sustainable conservation of wildlife habitat in the context of BPA's activities.

3517	Redband Trout River Habitat Assessment v1.0	Redband Trout, Lake Roosevelt, Columbia River, Spokane River, Upper Columbia River, Grand Coulee Dam, Riverine systems	The construction of Grand Coulee Dam in 1939 led to the elimination of the anadromous life history form of Redband Trout from the upper Columbia River. This event likely isolated populations and habitats of potamodromous Redband Trout in riverine systems such as the Spokane River, Lake Roosevelt, and the upper Columbia River. Despite the historical significance, comprehensive habitat assessments for Redband Trout populations in these riverine systems have not been conducted. The need for this protocol arises from the critical knowledge gap regarding the current state of Redband Trout habitat in the upper Columbia River basin. By evaluating and monitoring these habitats, managers aim to gain insights into Redband Trout population characteristics and identify key habitat factors influencing their populations.	Biodiversity Preservation: The protocol aligns with the value of preserving biodiversity by addressing the need to understand and conserve the habitat of Redband Trout, a species impacted by historical human activities. Ecological Restoration: Investment in this protocol reflects a commitment to ecological restoration, acknowledging the ecological consequences of past dam construction and striving to assess and rehabilitate Redband Trout habitats.	The absence of comprehensive habitat assessments in riverine systems hosting Redband Trout populations within the upper Columbia River basin poses a challenge. Without this crucial information, managers face difficulty understanding Redband Trout population characteristics and the habitat factors influencing their well-being.	Population Understanding: The protocol aims to enhance managers' understanding of Redband Trout populations by conducting comprehensive habitat assessments. This knowledge is essential for informed decision-making and conservation efforts. Habitat Factor Identification: By evaluating Redband Trout habitat, the protocol seeks to identify key habitat factors that may influence populations. This outcome is crucial for implementing targeted habitat management strategies. 	The protocol addresses the need for a detailed evaluation of Redband Trout habitat in riverine systems within the upper Columbia River basin. The construction of Grand Coulee Dam in 1939 disrupted the migration of the anadromous life history form of Redband Trout, potentially isolating populations and habitats of potamodromous Redband Trout. The lack of comprehensive habitat assessments in critical riverine systems, including the Spokane River, Lake Roosevelt, and the upper Columbia River, necessitates the development and implementation of this protocol. This protocol is essential for understanding Redband Trout population characteristics and identifying habitat factors that may influence these populations. The methods employed will be tailored to the specific limitations and requirements of data collection within each watershed, ensuring a nuanced and effective approach to habitat assessment. The ultimate goal is to fill the knowledge gap regarding Redband Trout habitats, facilitating informed conservation strategies and contributing to the preservation of biodiversity and ecological restoration in the upper Columbia River basin.

2193	Upper Columbia Nutrient Supplementation Project, BPA Project 2008-471-00 v1.0	Yakama Nation, Columbia Basin, Treaty-reserved tribal fisheries, ESA, Upper Columbia River ESU/DPS, Independent Scientific Advisory Board, ISAB, MDN, Methow basin, Hancock Springs, MDN replacement, Research Questions, Hypotheses, BPA, Action Effectiveness Monitoring, AEM Program.	The Yakama Nation, as a fishery co-manager, is committed to enhancing the status of its resources, particularly the naturally reproducing salmonid populations within the Upper Columbia River ESU/DPS. Chronic concerns persist regarding low levels of natural production by ESA-listed fish species, which constrain Treaty-reserved tribal fisheries at their usual and accustomed fishing areas. Despite extensive past and ongoing recovery efforts, these populations remain among the least productive and are at significant risk of extinction. One identified factor contributing to chronically low fish numbers is density dependence, as documented by the Independent Scientific Advisory Board (ISAB). Reduced marine-derived nutrients (MDN), stemming from the decline in returning adult salmonids over the past century, limit salmonid densities. The Yakama Nation believes that a food web perspective is essential for a more ecologically informed context for restoration efforts. To address these challenges, the Yakama Nation proposes a multiyear experimental MDN addition to a Methow basin stream, Hancock Springs. The project aims to clarify the empirical effects, benefits, and potential risks of MDN addition to juvenile salmonid food webs. The study design, including a robust 3-year pre-treatment, allows for the isolation of fine-scale effects and trophic cascading energy patterns from annual nutrient treatments. Furthermore, the project aims to assess the risk that MDN addition could produce deleterious effects by disrupting or altering food web dynamics, particularly concerning invasive, non-native species such as brook trout. The monitoring program, integrated into BPA's Action Effectiveness Monitoring (AEM) Program, focuses on the following objectives: 1. Determine if MDN replacement will disrupt the trophic ecology of salmonid food webs to preferentially benefit non-target competitor or predator fish species. 2. Evaluate how MDN replacement affects productivity and dynamics of salmonid food webs, natural production, and the growth and condition of juvenile salmonids in the freshwater rearing environment.	Conservation Commitment: The Yakama Nation's commitment to improving the status of its resources reflects a dedication to conservation, ensuring the well-being of present and future tribal members. Treaty Rights Preservation: Addressing low natural production is essential for preserving Treaty-reserved tribal fisheries at their usual and accustomed fishing areas.	The Yakama Nation is deeply concerned about the persistently low levels of natural production by ESA-listed fish species in the Columbia Basin, particularly within the Upper Columbia River ESU/DPS. Despite past and ongoing recovery efforts, these salmonid populations remain among the least productive and at the greatest risk of extinction.	Enhanced Natural Production: The primary goal is to restore and enhance the natural production of ESA-listed anadromous salmonids in the Upper Columbia River ESU/DPS. Ecological Context for Restoration: Recognizing the need for a broader ecological perspective, the project aims to provide a more informed context for restoration efforts, especially considering density dependence and marine-derived nutrient limitations.	The Yakama Nation, as a fishery co-manager, recognizes its obligation to apply effective management tools for the benefit of tribal members. The chronic issue of low natural production in ESA-listed fish species prompts the exploration of innovative solutions. The density dependence documented by the Independent Scientific Advisory Board (ISAB) underscores the need for a comprehensive approach. The decline in marine-derived nutrients (MDN), a key factor affecting salmonid densities, motivates the examination of nutrient supplementation as a viable restoration action. Research Questions and Hypotheses: Effect of MDN Replacement on Salmonid Food Webs: Hypothesis: The controlled addition of MDN (carcass analogue) will positively impact the productivity and dynamics of salmonid food webs, contributing to the growth, condition, and survival of juvenile salmonids in the freshwater rearing environment. Trophic Ecology Disruption by MDN Replacement: Hypothesis: MDN replacement has the potential to disrupt the trophic ecology of salmonid food webs, with the risk of preferentially benefiting non-target competitor or predator fish species. The proposed multiyear experimental MDN addition to Hancock Springs in the Methow basin aims to provide empirical insights into the effects, benefits, and potential risks of MDN supplementation on salmonid populations and their supporting ecosystems. The study design includes a robust 3-year pre-treatment to isolate fine-scale effects and trophic cascading energy patterns, with a specific focus on assessing the risk of detrimental effects, such as the disruption of food web dynamics for invasive, non-native species like brook trout.
