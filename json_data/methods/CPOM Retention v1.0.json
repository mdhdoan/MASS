  "abstractText": "Course particulate organic matter (CPOM) is defined as organic matter particles larger than 1 mm in size (Cummins 1974) and includes allochthonous and autochthonous materials that provide an important energetic resource (i.e., fixed carbon) for stream ecosystems (Lamberti and Gregory Chapter, Methods in Stream Ecology, 2006). CPOM retention, the process of deposition and trapping of these materials, provides an important function for long-term storage and processing of CPOM, and is therefore an important measure of a streams retentive capacity. Factors such as substrate particle size, streambed roughness, hydraulic conditions, and abundant wood combine to influence a streams CPOM retentive capacity.",
