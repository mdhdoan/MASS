2. Abstract:
Wet meadow restoration is a crucial method for managing water storage and late-season streamflow in mountain catchments. Upland valley floors, which include the channel, alluvial surfaces, and sub-surface fill of the valley bottom extending to unweathered bedrock, create an unconfined alluvial aquifer where shallow sub-surface flow is tightly coupled with surface flow. By restoring the vegetated surface of the upland valley floor and any associated channel-lining wetlands, it is possible to facilitate an ecological shift from xeric to mesic species, thereby improving overall ecosystem health and resilience.
3. Description:
The text describes the importance of understanding the geomorphic features of upland valley floors in order to effectively manage water storage and late-season streamflow in mountain catchments. Upland valley floors are defined as nearly flat surfaces extending between two adjacent hillslopes located in the headwater reaches of mountain catchments, and they include the channel, alluvial surfaces (floodplains and terraces), and sub-surface fill of the valley bottom extending vertically to unweathered bedrock. This valley fill creates an unconfined alluvial aquifer, where shallow sub-surface flow is tightly coupled with surface flow. The term "meadow" is used to refer to the vegetated surface of the upland valley floor and any associated channel-lining wetlands. Wet meadow restoration involves bringing the stream surface to an elevation where the meadow area will experience standing water connected to the stream, thereby facilitating an ecological shift from xeric to mesic species.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of wet meadow restoration is to improve overall ecosystem health and resilience by facilitating an ecological shift from xeric to mesic species in mountain catchments.
5. Constraints:
One constraint for wet meadow restoration is the need for sufficient water storage and late-season streamflow in order to maintain standing water on the meadow surface. Additionally, the success of wet meadow restoration may be limited by factors such as soil composition, vegetation type, and climate conditions.
