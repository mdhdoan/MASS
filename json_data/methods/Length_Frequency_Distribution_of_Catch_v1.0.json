  "abstractText": "Understanding the length frequency distribution of a fish population can assist in the understanding of population dynamics, and can help biologists detect year-class failures, problems with growth, or too high levels of annual mortality (Anderson and Neumann 1996). Data collected via fisheries sampling activities can serve assurrogate for the population as a whole (Anderson and Neumann 1996).",
