  "abstractText": "When run forecasts suggests that there will be a suitable return of hatchery spring Chinook salmon to the Hood River a tribal subsistence fishery is opened to Warm Springs tribal members in the Hood River basin. Virtually all tribal fishing occurs in the West Fork of the Hood River near Punchbowl Falls which is accessed by a single access point. Fishery managers desire information on tribal harvest effort, catch, and harvest. Also monitoring biologists desire biological and tag recovery information on fish harvested in the fishery. To accomplish this a schedule is developed for a single access point creel design as described in Pollack et al (1994) and tribal members are employed to man the access point, conduct fisher interviews, and sample harvested fish.",
