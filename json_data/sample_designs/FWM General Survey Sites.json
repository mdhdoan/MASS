  "description": "<p>Understanding the status and distribution of freshwater mussels across the ceded territory is one of the primary goals of the Freshwater Mussel Project.&nbsp; To do this,&nbsp;freshwater mussel specific surveys are carried&nbsp;out in&nbsp;rivers and streams&nbsp;across the territory.&nbsp; This sample design includes all opportunistic sampling efforts during the field season.&nbsp; Specific sites are targeted for&nbsp;long term monitoring, broodstock maintenance,&nbsp;or are associated with planned habitat restoration work, but other sites are surveyed to add coverage&nbsp;of&nbsp;areas with previously unknown mussel distribution.&nbsp; Sites are often selected after collaborators collect shell material from a site not previously surveyed for mussels, or new land acquisition makes access possible&nbsp;to a site.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
