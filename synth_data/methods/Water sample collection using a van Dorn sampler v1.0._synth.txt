2. Abstract: This method provides general considerations and procedures for collecting and processing representative water grab samples from surface waters in California. Using a van Dorn sampler, these grab samples can determine the concentration of various analytical parameters at a given point in time. Proper sampling technique is crucial to ensure valid and comparable results, allowing for effective water quality analysis.
3. Description: The text describes the method used by the Department of Water Resources in California for collecting representative water grab samples from surface waters using a van Dorn sampler. Grab samples are taken to measure the concentration of various analytical parameters at a specific point in time and are essential for accurate water quality analysis. Emphasis is placed on the importance of proper sampling technique, as it directly impacts the validity and comparability of results.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to provide a systematic and reliable approach for collecting and processing representative water grab samples from surface waters in California.
5. Constraints: The main constraint for this method is ensuring that proper sampling techniques are followed, as any deviation can significantly impact the accuracy and comparability of results. Additionally, the method may be limited by the availability of resources such as a van Dorn sampler and access to surface water sources in California.
