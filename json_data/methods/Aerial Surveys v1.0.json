  "abstractText": "Counts at approximately 200' above the water occur on a weekly to bimonthly basis in each stream.  The number of new redds, live fish, and carcasses are recorded during each helicopter flight.  Carcasses sighted from the air are identified as to location and retrieved later, if possible, with the use of jet or drift boats.   Adult carcasses will provide biological measurements of size, spawning success, age at ocean entry, and hatchery contribution to natural production sample method and samples taken use the methods listed above.  A systematic sampling strategy may be used to conduct underwater video searches in deep-water areas where fall Chinook salmon redds are expected.  A jet boat and video camera mounted on weighted in-stream flow equipment will be used to search potential deep water spawning areas.  This technique will be used only in assessable lower reaches of the Clearwater and Salmon rivers.",
