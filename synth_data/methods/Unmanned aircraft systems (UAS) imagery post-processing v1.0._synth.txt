2. Abstract: The method discussed in this text involves generating primary post-processing products from unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) imagery of stream channels. These products include a dense point cloud, orthomosaic, Digital Surface Model (DSM), and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The purpose is to utilize these outputs for calculating channel morphology, riparian vegetation, and instream cover metrics, which are essential for understanding and managing waterways.
3. Description: UAS imagery of stream channels undergo post-processing to produce valuable products such as a dense point cloud, orthomosaic, DSM, and DEM. A dense point cloud is a set of data points in a 3D coordinate system, representing the surface of the imaged objects. An orthomosaic is an aerial image that has been geometrically corrected to represent the Earth's surface accurately, with no distortion due to topography or camera tilt. A DSM models the earth's surface including man-made structures and vegetation, while a DEM represents the bare ground elevation without any objects or vegetation. These products enable the calculation of channel morphology, riparian vegetation, and instream cover metrics, which contribute to better waterway management and understanding.
4. Target: The primary focus is generating accurate post-processing products from UAS imagery for stream channel analysis.
5. Constraints: The method's constraints include the quality of UAS imagery, potential errors or inaccuracies in image data, computational resources required to process large datasets, and the need for expertise in UAS imaging, photogrammetry, and GIS.
