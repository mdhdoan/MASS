2. Abstract: Habitat restoration projects often involve planting trees and shrubs to promote the growth of woody vegetation. This is crucial for achieving project objectives such as establishing woody vegetation cover in a designated area. A comprehensive method for collecting data on floodplain woody vegetation composition and percent cover, Method #1183, is described in detail to assist with evaluating the success of restoration projects.

3. Description: The text details Method #1183 for data collection on floodplain woody vegetation composition and percent cover, which is used to evaluate the establishment of woody vegetation cover in a project area. This method is important for assessing whether habitat restoration objectives are being met. The method involves identifying and classifying woody vegetation into different categories, such as tree or shrub, and estimating the percentage of cover they occupy in the project area. The data collection process is described step-by-step to ensure accurate and consistent measurements.

4. Target: The primary focus of Method #1183 is to provide a standardized approach for collecting data on floodplain woody vegetation composition and percent cover, which can be used to evaluate the success of habitat restoration projects in establishing woody vegetation cover.

5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need for trained personnel to accurately identify and classify woody vegetation, as well as the time and resources required to conduct comprehensive data collection in the field. Additionally, weather conditions and accessibility of the project area may also pose challenges to data collection.
