2. Abstract: The Nez Perce Creel Survey method is a crucial tool for estimating the tribal harvest of steelhead, fall Chinook, and spring Chinook in the Usual and Accustomed fishing areas along the North Fork Clearwater River. This approach offers a reliable basis for accounting annual harvest, highlights trends in fisheries through multiple years of data, and contributes to run-reconstruction, SAR estimations, and run forecast models. By providing real-time catch information, it ensures that proposed harvest strategies are implemented as planned, maintaining balance in the ecosystem while respecting tribal rights.

3. Description: The Nez Perce Creel Survey method is specifically designed for application on the North Fork Clearwater River to estimate the treaty catch of steelhead, fall Chinook, and spring Chinook, along with incidental species. This method generates harvest information that guarantees the proposed harvest strategy's successful execution, offering a baseline accounting of Nez Perce annual harvest. With multiple years of data, it is possible to recognize trends in the fisheries, which supports run-reconstruction, SAR estimations, and run forecast models.

The Nez Perce Harvest Monitoring Program utilizes four distinct methods for estimating Treaty harvest, including this Creel Survey method, in-season interview survey, post-season interview survey, and gill net in-season interview survey. The Creel Survey method differentiates itself from the others by focusing on the North Fork Clearwater River.

4. Target: The primary focus of the Nez Perce Creel Survey method is to provide a reliable estimate of tribal harvest for specific species in the Usual and Accustomed fishing areas along the North Fork Clearwater River, ensuring compliance with proposed harvest strategies, and offering valuable data for resource management purposes.

5. Constraints: The Nez Perce Creel Survey method's successful application depends on factors such as proper implementation, accurate data collection, and consistent monitoring to ensure that the estimated harvest aligns with the actual catch in the targeted fishing areas along the North Fork Clearwater River. Additionally, this method is limited to a specific geographical area, making it less applicable for broader assessments of other river systems or regions without adjustments.
