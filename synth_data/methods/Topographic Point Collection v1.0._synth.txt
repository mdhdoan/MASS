2. Abstract: The method described in this text involves the creation of a three-dimensional digital elevation model (DEM) to represent the topography of a stream channel. This is achieved through surveying points and lines that collectively represent the channel's topography. The selection of these points and lines is crucial for the survey's utility, as they capture features such as visible contours, thalweg, bankfull, toe of bank, and top of bank. The person operating the rod during the survey plays a vital role in ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the process.
3. Description: The method described here is for creating a digital elevation model (DEM) of a stream channel's topography through surveying points and lines with X, Y, and Z coordinates. This process involves the person operating the rod during the survey to carefully select points and lines that collectively represent the channel's topography. Lines are used to represent visible contours in the stream channel topography and capture features such as the thalweg, bankfull, toe of bank, and top of bank. They also represent the water's edge and the survey extent. Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in relief that are not captured by lines. The codes for each point and line type are listed in Table 13.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to create a digital elevation model (DEM) of a stream channel's topography through an efficient surveying process.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need for accurate and careful selection of points and lines during the survey, as well as an understanding of the features being captured such as thalweg, bankfull, toe of bank, and top of bank. Additionally, knowledge of the codes listed in Table 13 is required to conduct the survey efficiently.
