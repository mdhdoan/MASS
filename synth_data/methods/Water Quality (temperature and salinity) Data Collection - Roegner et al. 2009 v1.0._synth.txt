2. Abstract: This method highlights the importance of measuring time series of water quality parameters at reference and restoration sites to understand biotic changes. It advocates the use of autonomous data logging equipment for accurate and continuous monitoring of various water quality parameters such as temperature, salinity, turbidity, pH, and dissolved oxygen. The focus is on temperature in tidal freshwater regimes and temperature and salinity in estuarine habitats due to their significant impact on vegetation community structure and suitability for organisms. This method aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of hydrologic reconnection on aquatic ecosystems.

3. Description: The text emphasizes the significance of water quality parameters in assessing changes in habitat opportunity and biotic responses, particularly in the context of hydrologic reconnection projects. Autonomous data logging equipment is recommended for monitoring these parameters due to their ability to provide accurate and continuous measurements. While dissolved oxygen (DO) is an important metric, data collection issues make temperature and salinity more critical for tidal freshwater regimes and estuarine habitats, respectively. The method suggests that increased circulation from tidal reconnection can mitigate excessive temperatures and maintain suitable DO levels. At the same time, higher salinity intrusion on a restored site can determine vegetation community structure. The ultimate goal is to measure water quality parameters over time at reference and restoration sites and correlate these findings with biotic changes to gain insights into the impact of hydrologic reconnection on aquatic ecosystems.

4. Target: To understand the relationship between water quality parameters and biotic changes in the context of hydrologic reconnection projects.

5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method include potential difficulties in collecting DO data, the need for specialized equipment to monitor various water quality parameters, and ensuring adequate placement and calibration of monitoring devices to maintain accuracy and precision.
