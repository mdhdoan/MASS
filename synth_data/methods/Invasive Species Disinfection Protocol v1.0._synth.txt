2. Abstract: The proliferation of invasive species in the Pacific Northwest, such as the New Zealand mud snail, has become a significant concern due to their expanding range into nine Western states. These invasive species pose a threat as potential vectors for exotic species and diseases. The AREMP protocol is a preventative measure designed to minimize the risk of spreading these harmful organisms through proper disinfection of all field gear before and after use in different locations.
3. Description: Invasive species, specifically the New Zealand mud snail, have been detected in stream systems across nine Western states, including Oregon's Columbia River estuary. Due to the extensive travel required for fieldwork, there is a high potential for these crews to unintentionally spread exotic species and diseases. The AREMP protocol serves as a proactive approach to mitigate this risk by ensuring all field gear starts each trip in a clean and disinfected state. The procedures outlined in the protocol provide detailed instructions on maintaining the integrity of equipment and preventing cross-contamination between different sampling sites.
4. Target: The primary goal of the AREMP protocol is to reduce the potential for spreading exotic species and diseases through proper field gear management and disinfection.
5. Constraints: While not explicitly mentioned in the text, potential constraints for this method could include access to appropriate disinfecting solutions, time required for cleaning and disinfecting procedures, and training personnel on proper protocol implementation.
