  "abstractText": "The plan includes escapement/number of mature adults as an important biological indicator of population status.  Total escapement of anadromous fish into subbasins within the Upper Columbia Basin can be estimated roughly as the number of fish counted at mainstem Columbia River dams.  Spawning escapement can be estimated as the number of redds times a fish-per-redd estimate.  Number of resident adult fish should be estimated within status/trend monitoring reaches and effectiveness monitoring sites using underwater observations (snorkeling) or electrofishing surveys.  Snorkeling is the primary sampling method in this survey, electrofishing is the secondary.The plan includes six indicators associated with the characteristics of the spawning populations: age structure, size, sex ratio, origin, genetics, and fecundity.  Age structure and origin are determined by reading scales and noting the absence or presence of adipose fins.  Fork length and hypural length are measured to the nearest mm.  The gender of each fish sampled will be recorded.  Fecundity (total number of eggs produced by a given size female) will be estimated for fish collected for hatchery broodstock and from dead pre-spawn females collected during spawning surveys.  Genetic samples are collected and analyzed according to the protocols being refined at the WDFW Genetics Lab.",
