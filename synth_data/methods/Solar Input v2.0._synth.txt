2. Abstract: This method describes the process of measuring solar radiation entering a stream channel using the Solmetric SunEye device. The purpose is to gather accurate data on solar radiation at evenly spaced transects throughout the site. To ensure accuracy, it is crucial to capture good quality images under specific atmospheric conditions such as low sun angle or uniform overcast sky, and minimal sun flares or spots. Proper handling of the SunEye device is also necessary for clear and representative images. Each skyline image captured by the SunEye is stored in a work session named using the Site ID and date.
3. Description: The objective of this method is to measure solar radiation entering a stream channel at evenly spaced transects throughout the site. A Solmetric SunEye device is used to capture solar radiation measurements at the center of the wetted channel on all odd-numbered transects (1, 3, 5, 7, 21). To ensure accuracy in estimation of solar radiation, it is essential to obtain good quality images. This requires specific atmospheric conditions such as low sun angle or uniform overcast sky and absence of sun flares or spots. Holding the SunEye level and steady ensures that images are clear and representative of the vegetation directly overhead. The SunEye captures images called skylines, each stored in a work session named using the Site ID and date for easy identification and organization. (Refer to Appendix M for Solmetric SunEye operating instructions.)
4. Target: To measure solar radiation entering a stream channel at evenly spaced transects throughout the site using the Solmetric SunEye device.
5. Constraints: The primary constraint of this method is the dependence on specific atmospheric conditions to capture usable images. These conditions include low sun angle or uniform overcast sky, and absence of sun flares or spots. Additionally, proper handling of the SunEye device is necessary for clear and representative images.
