2. Abstract: This method outlines the process of measuring and analyzing stream temperature using temperature loggers equipped with sensors. The loggers are placed in-stream and record temperature data hourly throughout the year. The data is then downloaded and summary statistics such as counts, mins, maxs, and means are calculated for daily, monthly, and 8-day running periods. Additionally, 7-day running metrics are calculated for the July 15-August 31 window to monitor summer temperature trends.
3. Description: The method involves the use of temperature loggers with sensors to measure stream temperatures. These loggers are placed in-stream and remain there throughout the year, collecting temperature data every hour. The data is then downloaded, and summary statistics such as counts, mins, maxs, and means are calculated for daily, monthly, and 8-day running periods. Furthermore, 7-day running metrics are calculated specifically for the summer months (July 15-August 31) to monitor temperature trends during this critical period. The Step by Step section provides a detailed guide on how to conduct the data analysis.
4. Target: To accurately measure and analyze stream temperatures using loggers with sensors, providing summary statistics for various time periods and monitoring summer temperature trends.
5. Constraints: The method requires the use of temperature loggers with sensors and may be limited by factors such as cost, availability, and access to streams. Additionally, accurate data analysis relies on proper placement and maintenance of the loggers in-stream.
