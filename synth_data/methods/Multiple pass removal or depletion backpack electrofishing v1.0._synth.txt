2. Abstract:
The method of salmonid enumeration using multiple removal electrofishing is a common technique used in small streams. This method involves electrofishing to capture and remove fish from a section of stream, with subsequent passes used to calculate catchability assumptions and abundance estimates. The Zippin removal estimator has been found to be sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions, so the generalized removal estimator was proposed as an alternative that allows for unequal catchability between removal passes. However, this method requires conducting four or more removal passes, which can be costly and time-consuming. Two pass estimates may satisfy effort requirements but can produce biased results with wide confidence intervals. Therefore, charts have been developed to provide reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. Removal sampling can be useful for indexing abundance when accurate estimates are not necessary. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions.
3. Description:
The method of salmonid enumeration in small streams using multiple removal electrofishing is based on the technique proposed by Moran (1951) and Zippin (1958). Under this method, a section of stream is isolated with block nets and multiple removal electrofishing passes are performed to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions. To address this issue, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability between removal passes. This method requires conducting four or more removal passes, which can be costly and time-consuming. However, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased. Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines to provide reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions.
4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to calculate abundance estimates of salmonids in small streams through multiple removal electrofishing passes.
5. Constraints:
Some constraints for this method include the need for costly and time-consuming removal passes, the sensitivity of the Zippin removal estimator to violations of catchability assumptions, and the potential for biased results with two pass estimates. Additionally, accurate estimates require calibration with an unbiased estimate or validation of critical assumptions under field conditions.
