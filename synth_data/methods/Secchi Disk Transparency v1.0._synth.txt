2. Abstract: The Secchi disk is a simple and cost-effective tool used to measure water transparency, which serves as an indicator of water clarity. This method is crucial for evaluating water quality and health, as it helps identify potential issues such as pollution or eutrophication. Despite some limitations due to environmental factors like sunlight glare and human error, Secchi disk readings remain a widely used and valuable approach for assessing water bodies.

3. Description: A Secchi disk is a circular disk with black and white quadrants that is lowered into the water until it becomes invisible. The depth at which the pattern on the disk disappears is recorded as an estimate of water transparency. This measurement helps determine water clarity, which is an essential aspect of water quality assessment. However, Secchi disk readings may be influenced by external factors, such as sun glare and observer's visual acuity, leading to potential inaccuracies. Nevertheless, the method's simplicity, low cost, and ease of use make it a popular choice for monitoring water bodies' transparency and overall health.

4. Target: The primary goal of using a Secchi disk is to measure water transparency as an indicator of water clarity and quality.

5. Constraints: Secchi disk measurements can be influenced by various constraints, including sun glare on the water surface, operator's visual acuity, and water turbidity caused by suspended particles or algae blooms. These factors may affect the accuracy of the readings, but they do not prevent the method from being a valuable tool for monitoring water clarity in different aquatic environments.
