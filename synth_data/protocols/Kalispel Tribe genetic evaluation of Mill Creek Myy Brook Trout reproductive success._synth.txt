 1. Abstract: The text describes a protocol to address the impact of non-native Brook Trout on native Westslope Cutthroat Trout populations. A solution is proposed using mechanical, chemical or alternative removal methods to reduce Brook Trout abundance and allow natural or assisted re-occupancy of vacated habitat. A specific method called the Trojan Y Chromosome method is being tested, which involves stocking genetically modified male Brook Trout (YY) into areas inhabited by non-native species targeted for removal. The goal is to shift the sex ratio of the target population towards males, ultimately leading to the extirpation of Brook Trout and allowing Cutthroat Trout to reoccupy vacated habitat.
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes: The value of preserving native species and their habitats is highlighted. The problem statement is the negative impact of non-native Brook Trout on native Westslope Cutthroat Trout populations. The desired outcome is the extirpation of Brook Trout from Mill Creek, allowing Cutthroat Trout to reoccupy vacated habitat.
3. Description: The text provides a detailed description of the Trojan Y Chromosome method and its application in Mill Creek. The method involves producing and stocking genetically modified male fish (YY) into areas inhabited by non-native Brook Trout, with the goal of shifting the sex ratio towards males and ultimately leading to the extirpation of Brook Trout. Annual genetic tissue sampling of juveniles is used to collect parentage information and inform the spawning success of stocked MYYBrook Trout. Genetic determination of sex is also used to inform ratio shifts from the expected normal proportion of males in a wild population (i.e., 0.5).
4. Objectives: The objective is to evaluate the contribution of MYY towards shifting the population to predominantly males, expediting the extirpation of Brook Trout from Mill Creek and allowing Cutthroat to eventually reoccupy vacated habitat. This objective covers the entire problem statement. Keywords related to this objective include Trojan Y Chromosome method, genetically modified male fish (YY), and extirpation of Brook Trout.
5. Target: The primary focus or goal of the protocol is to shift the sex ratio of Brook Trout towards males and ultimately lead to their extirpation from Mill Creek.
6. Constraints: The constraints for this protocol include the need to maintain genetic diversity in native Cutthroat Trout populations, potential ethical concerns around genetically modifying fish, and regulatory approval for releasing genetically modified organisms into the wild.
