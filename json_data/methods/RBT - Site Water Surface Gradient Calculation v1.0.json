  "abstractText": "TheRBTis a suite of GIS tools that work within theESRIArcGISDesktop software. TheRBTallows users to describe and measure river channels using high resolution digital elevation models (DEM). TheDEMscan be derived from airborne remote sensing, such asLiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With theRBTyou can: -Detrenda DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. thebankfullwidth/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in adetrendedDEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat.TheRBTis anArcGISextension and as such you have to haveArcGISinstalled before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.
