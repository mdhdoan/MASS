  "abstract": " Net pen enumeration surveys are conducted before releasing farmed fish from net pens to assess the survival rate of the fish during their rearing process. This method involves physically counting and recording each individual fish in the net pen using underwater cameras or by visually observing them from the water surface.\n\nThe necessity of this method lies in ensuring the health and productivity of fish farms, as well as complying with regulatory requirements. By accurately determining the survival rate, farmers can identify any potential issues that may have arisen during the rearing process, such as disease outbreaks or environmental factors affecting fish growth. This information allows them to take corrective actions promptly, minimizing losses and maintaining optimal fish health.\n\nNet pen enumeration surveys contribute to addressing concerns related to fish welfare and biosecurity by providing an essential tool for monitoring stock health and ensuring the sustainable production of farmed fish."

  "description": " Net pen enumeration surveys are essential procedures conducted immediately before the release of farmed fish from net pens. The release timing usually falls between late May and mid-June. These surveys aim to evaluate rearing survival rates by meticulously counting and inspecting individual fish in the net pens.\n\nThe enumeration process involves a series of systematic observations and data collection techniques applied to each net pen. A team of trained personnel performs this task, utilizing specialized equipment such as underwater cameras or snorkeling gear to access the submerged portions of the net pen.\n\nUsing clipboards or handheld computers, they record specific information about each fish, including its size (length and weight), species, and overall health condition. This data is crucial for assessing rearing survival rates, which help farmers determine the success of their aquaculture practices and identify areas for improvement.\n\nAdditionally, enumeration surveys may include taking random samples of fish to conduct more detailed inspections or analyses, such as checking for signs of disease or parasitic infections. This information is essential for maintaining fish health and overall farm productivity.\n\nIn summary, net pen enumeration surveys are critical components of fish farming operations. They provide valuable insights into rearing survival rates by systematically counting and inspecting individual fish before their release from net pens. These procedures help farmers optimize their aquaculture practices and ensure a healthy and thriving population of farmed fish."
