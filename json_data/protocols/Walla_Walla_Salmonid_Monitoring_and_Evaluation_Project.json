  "background": "The Walla Walla Basin Salmonid Monitoring and Evaluation Project was transitioned in 2007 to a collaborative effort between the CTUIR, WDFW, and a Tribal accord with BPA. In January 2007, BPA requested of this project an amended collaborative proposal; one that emphasized salmonid status and trend monitoring focused primarily on adult abundance and population productivity. Tribal and state partners agreed to collaborate on the project proposal, budget, statement of work and annual report; but, retained their individual contracts with BPA. Currently, CTUIR focuses monitoring efforts in Mill Creek, South Fork Walla Walla and mainstem Walla Walla rivers. Similar work in the Touchet River drainage is currently conducted independently by WDFWthrough a separate project.The Walla Walla Subbasin supports steelhead and bull trout that are both listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act , and a reintroduced population of spring Chinook. These populations are depressed relative to historic levels. Prior to the start of this project, the subbasin co-managers did not have adequate information to answer specific management questions regarding Viable Salmonid Population parameters of abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity.Our goal is to provide ecological information to decision makers in support of adaptive management for ESA recovery, population restoration, conservation, and preservation of cultural, social, and economic salmonid resources. We do this by emphasizing monitoring of population status and trends to estimate adults in and juveniles out as a measure of salmonid population viability within the subbasin.The management questions addressed by this project: Is the abundance of adult fish trending towards restoration goals for each population? Is the population productivity of fish trending towards restoration goals for each population? What is the spatial structure of each population? What are the major life history strategies for each population? What is the population viability?",
