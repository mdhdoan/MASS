2. Abstract:
The text describes the method for quantifying large wood pieces in aquatic environments, specifically focusing on two measures - Wetted Large Wood Frequency and Bankfull Large Wood Frequency. This information is essential to understand the amount of large wood debris present in a site's wetted and bankfull channels. The CHaMP-LWD Method provides guidelines for enumerating these pieces, ensuring consistent measurement and comparison across different sites. By counting qualifying pieces (>0.10m diameter, 1.0m length) per 100 meters of bankfull length, the method offers a standardized approach to assess large wood debris in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to better management and preservation efforts.

3. Description:
The text presents the Large Wood Frequency method used for counting qualifying large wood pieces within wetted and bankfull channels. This technique focuses on the main stem or root portions extending into the channel and requires a diameter greater than 0.10m. Wetted Large Wood Frequency refers to the number (per 100 m) of qualifying pieces found in the wetted channel, while Bankfull Large Wood Frequency indicates the count within the bankfull channel. The text mentions the CHaMP-LWD Method as a resource for debris enumeration background and further information. By standardizing counts per 100 meters of bankfull length, this method allows comparisons between sites with varying dimensions, improving data consistency and interpretation in aquatic ecosystem management.

4. Target:
The primary focus of the Large Wood Frequency method is to provide a consistent approach for quantifying large wood debris within wetted and bankfull channels. This enables effective comparison and evaluation across different sites.

5. Constraints:
This method requires a clear definition and understanding of the wetted channel and bankfull channel boundaries. The presence of qualifying large wood pieces (>0.10m diameter, 1.0m length) should be accurately determined based on visual assessment or measurement. Standardizing counts per 100 meters of bankfull length assumes that channels have similar widths, which may not always be the case; therefore, caution should be taken when comparing sites with significantly different dimensions.
