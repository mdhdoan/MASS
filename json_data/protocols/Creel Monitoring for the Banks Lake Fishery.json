  "background": "The Banks Lake creel protocol was formulated from those described in Pollock et al. (1994), and Malvestuto (1983) as a monitoring and evaluation tool to estimate harvest rates of Kokanee stocked into the lake from the Ford State (project 2001-029-00) and Spokane Tribal hatcheries (project 1991-46-00). The creel also lended a means to monitor and evaluate the populations of Kokanee competitors including Lake Whitefish, Walleye, and Smallmouth Bass.",
