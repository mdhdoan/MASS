2. Abstract: This method describes how to measure bankfull width and height of a channel using a laser rangefinder. When the channel is too wide for a bank tape to provide accurate measurements, the text suggests using a handheld laser to shoot width distances and a surveying string to assist with depth measurements. This method provides a more precise way to calculate bankfull dimensions in wider channels, which is necessary for various studies on river ecology and hydrology.
3. Description: To measure bankfull width and height using a laser rangefinder, the user first needs to identify the location of the bankfull elevation along the channel. If the channel is narrow enough, a bank tape can be used to measure the width directly. However, if the channel is too wide for the bank tape to remain straight, the method suggests employing a handheld laser rangefinder to shoot and record multiple width distances at regular intervals across the channel. To ensure accurate depth measurements, the user should place a surveying string perpendicularly from one bank to the other, spanning the entire width of the channel. The user can then measure the distance between the water surface and the bottom of the channel at various points along the surveying string to obtain an average depth measurement. By multiplying this average depth by the total width obtained using the laser rangefinder, the user can calculate the bankfull cross-sectional area, which is essential for determining channel capacity and sediment transport potential.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a precise way to measure bankfull width and height in channels of varying sizes using a laser rangefinder and other basic equipment.
5. Constraints: This method requires access to a handheld laser rangefinder, surveying string, and adequate light conditions for accurate measurements. Additionally, the user must have the necessary skills and knowledge to identify bankfull elevation and ensure that measurements are taken perpendicularly to the flow direction to minimize error.
