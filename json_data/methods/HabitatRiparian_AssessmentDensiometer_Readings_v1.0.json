  "abstractText": "This method uses a convex spherical densiometer to collect a measure of canopy cover above a location. The method has been widely used in stream habitat monitoring protocols, and this approach is modified protocol from Kaufmann et al. (1999) and Peck et al. (2001). It is a quantifiable approach to measuring canopy cover, although it can be sensitive to judgment and measurement angle. Multiple measurements should be taken along a stream corridor to determine an 'average' canopy cover, and locations should be pre-determined at random or stratified locations for best, unbiased results.",
