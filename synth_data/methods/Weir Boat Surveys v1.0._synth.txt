2. Abstract: This method outlines a procedure for monitoring the impact of a weir on migrating salmon populations. Stream surveys are conducted to locate live and dead fish downstream of the weir. Observed delays in passage or fish mortalities trigger an adaptive management process involving a Technical Oversight Group (TOG). The goal is to ensure the safe passage and survival of salmon during migration, with constraints including specific thresholds for reporting and intervention.
3. Description: The method focuses on conducting regular stream surveys in the vicinity of a weir to detect live fish and fish carcasses. These surveys extend from the weir downstream 1 km to Chiliwist Creek. Information gathered during these surveys is evaluated daily for potential adverse effects on migrating salmon, which may be due to delays or mortality caused by the weir or its operations. If certain thresholds are met (e.g., 10 salmon mortalities in three consecutive surveys), the Project Lead consults with the TOG, which can recommend mitigative actions. The Project Lead is then responsible for implementing and monitoring these measures.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is ensuring safe passage and minimizing negative impacts on migrating salmon populations caused by a weir.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include specific thresholds for reporting (10 salmon mortalities in three consecutive surveys or 25 salmon mortalities in any one survey) and intervention, as well as the requirement for collaboration with the TOG to determine appropriate mitigative actions.
