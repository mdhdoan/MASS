 1. Relevant keywords: site map, UTM coordinates, verbal descriptions, relocate sites, characterize site, anthropogenic influence
2. Abstract: The creation and use of a detailed site map is essential for accurately relocating and characterizing a site in the future. By incorporating site photos, UTM coordinates, and verbal descriptions, the site map serves as a comprehensive guide for crew members. It is crucial to accurately depict unique and significant features of each site, including Tier 1 channel units, side channels, benchmarks, control points, and temperature loggers. Indicating any signs of anthropogenic influence, such as logging or cattle grazing, can also provide valuable context for relocating the site.
3. Description: A site map is a detailed diagram used in conjunction with site photos, UTM coordinates, and verbal descriptions to assist a crew in accurately relocating a site in the future. Site maps play a critical role in characterizing a site by accurately depicting its unique and significant features, including Tier 1 channel units and side channels. Benchmarks, control points, and temperature loggers are also important features to include on a site map. To ensure accuracy, it is essential that the artist takes their time to draw the site map to scale. Indicating any signs of anthropogenic influence, such as logging or cattle grazing, can provide valuable context for relocating the site. UTM coordinates can be used to precisely locate features on the site map and in the field.
4. Target: The primary focus of creating a site map is to accurately depict unique and significant features of a site to assist crew members in relocating it in the future.
5. Constraints: The accuracy and level of detail included in the site map are critical constraints for this method. It is essential that the artist takes their time to draw the site map to scale and accurately depict all relevant features. Additionally, including UTM coordinates and indications of anthropogenic influence can provide valuable context for relocating the site.
