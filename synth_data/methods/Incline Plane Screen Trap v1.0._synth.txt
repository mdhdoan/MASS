2. Abstract: Inclined plane screen traps are essential tools for fish sampling in various aquatic systems. These traps provide the ability to sample a range of stream velocities and depths by straining water through screens and depositing migratory fish into a protected live box. Different designs, such as the Humphreys trap and traveling screen trap, have been developed to address issues like debris buildup and adaptability to specific site characteristics. Proper regulation of flow into the trap is crucial for effective fish capture, considering factors like water velocity, debris load, and weather conditions.

3. Description: The design of inclined plane screen traps enables efficient fish sampling by allowing a range of stream velocities and depths to be trapped. The basic scoop trap design consists of a wedge-shaped screened rectangular tube suspended in the water column from a pontoon barge, with the screen section constructed typically of galvanized woven-wire mesh or perforated plate aluminum sheet metal riveted to a frame.

Different variations of inclined plane screen traps have been developed to address specific challenges:

* Traveling screen trap or Humphreys trap: Uses a traveling screen instead of a fixed screen along with a trash drum at the back of the livewell to reduce debris buildup on the trap. A paddle wheel and gear assembly, or a 12-V DC motor, powers the traveling screen in this design.
* Fixed screen design variations: The upstream end of the inclined plane screen can be attached to a low-head dam or weir for collecting fish passing over the structure. A lightweight inclined plane trap has also been used in Alaska for sampling salmon smolts.

Effective operation of an inclined plane screen trap requires careful monitoring and regulation of flow into the trap, considering factors like water velocity, debris load, and weather conditions. As swimming ability is directly related to body length, higher velocities are required to trap larger migrants, while fry may be captured at relatively low velocities.

4. Target: The primary focus of inclined plane screen traps is to effectively sample and retain various sizes of fish migrating in different aquatic systems by adapting to a range of stream velocities and depths.

5. Constraints: Inclined plane screen trap operation faces certain constraints, such as the need for careful monitoring and regular cleaning due to debris buildup and varying weather conditions. Additionally, optimal water velocity requirements may not always be achievable or consistent, potentially leading to decreased capture efficiency or escape of larger migrants. Operation during a freshet requires extra caution due to increased river discharge, requiring more frequent inspections, cleanings, and catch processing.
