2. Abstract:
This method, derived from the EMAP protocol for monitoring western wadable streams, provides a semi-quantitative evaluation of riparian vegetation. By visually estimating various types and amounts of vegetation in the riparian zone, this method assesses the health, disturbance level, and potential organic inputs/shading of the stream corridor. Additionally, it covers legacy trees and invasive riparian plants in separate sections.

3. Description:
The method is based on an EMAP protocol for monitoring western wadable streams, specifically expanding upon Canopy Cover Measurements. It involves visual estimation procedures to semi-quantitatively evaluate the type and amount of various riparian vegetation (Figure 7-12). These data are used to assess the health and disturbance level of the stream corridor, as well as indicate present and future potential for organic inputs and shading. The method focuses on the riparian area upstream and downstream 5 meters from 11 cross-section transects (Figure 7-1). A 10 m x 10 m plot is created on each side of the stream, covering the visible area from the stream back a distance of 10m (-30 ft) from both banks. The riparian plot dimensions are estimated, not measured. On steeply sloping channel margins, the plot boundaries are defined as if they were projected down from an aerial view. Sections 7.5.9 and 8 address legacy trees and invasive riparian plants, respectively (Figure 7-12).

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to evaluate the health, disturbance level, and organic input potential of western wadable stream corridors through semi-quantitative analysis of riparian vegetation.

5. Constraints:
This method relies on visual estimations, which may introduce subjectivity and variability in results. The dimensions of the riparian plots are estimated rather than measured, potentially affecting accuracy. On steeply sloping channel margins, projecting plot boundaries from an aerial view might result in less precise measurements.
