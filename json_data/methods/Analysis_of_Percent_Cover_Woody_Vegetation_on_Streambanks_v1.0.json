  "abstractText": "Streambank restoration projects may contain bioengineering structures or other streambank treatments intended to support establishment of woody riparian vegetation along the bank line. Monitoring the establishment of woody vegetation canopy cover within these structures or treatments can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments. Additionally, monitoring woody canopy cover development on these structures can evaluate the progress toward establishing desired vegetation cover types along streambanks and in the floodplain.Data collection methods are described in Percent Cover Woody Vegetation on Streambanks Method #1312 [https://www.monitoringresources.org/Document/Method/Details/1312].",
