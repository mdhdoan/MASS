2. Abstract: The PIBO-EM sample design is a method that involves rotating sampling sites over a 5-year period. This approach allows for the re-sampling of previously studied sites and ensures the collection of data from consistent locations. Maintaining spatial consistency in data collection is crucial, as it directly impacts the usefulness and reliability of the generated information.
3. Description: The PIBO-EM sample design consists of a 5-year cycle for sampling different sites. In this method, sites sampled in the first year (e.g., 2001) are revisited and resampled in the sixth year (e.g., 2006), with the intention to sample them once again in the eleventh year (e.g., 2011). This design emphasizes the importance of sampling the exact same section of a stream previously investigated, as inconsistencies in location may lead to unreliable and irrelevant data. By maintaining spatial consistency throughout the study period, researchers can effectively monitor changes and trends at each site over time.
4. Target: The primary goal of the PIBO-EM sample design is to ensure consistent, long-term data collection by revisiting previously sampled sites during a 5-year cycle.
5. Constraints: A major constraint for this method is the necessity of maintaining precise location records and ensuring that researchers return to the exact same section of the stream during subsequent sampling events. Failure to do so will compromise the validity and usefulness of the collected data.
