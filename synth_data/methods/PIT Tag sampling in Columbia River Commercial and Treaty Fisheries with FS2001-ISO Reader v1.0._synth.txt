2. Abstract: The application of PIT tags has grown significantly over the years, and this method proposes to expand the current LCR CWT recovery program to include all types of tags, including PIT tags. This will enable the provision of point and interval estimates for recovered PIT and CWT tags by stratum when sample sizes are sufficient. The goal is to make this information available to policy makers, planners, managers, and others to aid in decision making.
3. Description: The use of PIT tags has increased dramatically from 20,000 in 1988 to over 2,000,000 in 2009. Currently, only 2% of the returning adult salmon and steelhead passing Bonneville Dam (BON) are PIT tagged. The proposed recovery program aims to expand Washington's LCR CWT program to include a recovery program for all types of tags, including PIT tags, and marks sampled in fisheries and escapement programs. This expansion will allow for the provision of point and interval estimates for recovered PIT and CWT tags by stratum when sample sizes are sufficient. The project builds on the existing framework and infrastructure of the current CWT recovery program along with other state, federal, and locally funded fisheries and escapement sampling programs coordinated by the WDFW.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to expand the current LCR CWT recovery program to include PIT tags and make information on recovered tags available to a wide range of stakeholders.
5. Constraints: The main constraint for this method is the need for sufficient sample sizes to provide point and interval estimates for recovered PIT and CWT tags by stratum. Additionally, the success of the program relies on the cooperation and coordination with other state, federal, and locally funded fisheries and escapement sampling programs.
