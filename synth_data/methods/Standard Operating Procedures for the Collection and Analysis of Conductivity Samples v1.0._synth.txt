2. Abstract: The Environmental Assessment Program's (EAP) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the field collection and analysis of conductivity samples is a crucial component in monitoring freshwater environments. This SOP outlines the Direct In-Situ Method for wadeable streams, specifically for Total Maximum Daily Load and other special studies. The procedure includes meter calibration, sample collection, measurement, and quality assurance/quality control to ensure accurate results. Compliance with these guidelines is essential for regulatory requirements and environmental protection in freshwater systems.
3. Description: This text presents the EAP's SOP for collecting and analyzing conductivity samples in freshwater monitoring programs. The document focuses on the Direct In-Situ Method used in wadeable streams, which is applied in Total Maximum Daily Load studies and other special investigations. It covers essential aspects such as meter calibration, field sample collection, measurement procedures following Standard Methods 2510 B (APHA, 2005), and quality assurance/quality control practices. The SOP aims to ensure accurate and reliable conductivity measurements for environmental assessment purposes while adhering to regulatory requirements.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to establish a comprehensive guideline for the field collection and analysis of conductivity samples in freshwater monitoring, ensuring accurate data acquisition for environmental protection and compliance with regulatory standards.
5. Constraints: Users must adhere strictly to the outlined procedures to ensure accurate measurements and maintain quality assurance/quality control. Marine water measurements or samples require separate guidelines as specified in a Quality Assurance project plan. The method is limited to freshwater systems, and users should consult relevant resources for marine water monitoring.
