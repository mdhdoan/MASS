2. Abstract: The necessity of determining streambed particle size distribution within a sample reach is crucial for understanding substrate conditions in rivers and streams. Method 6801 provides an accurate and unbiased approach to calculating this distribution by taking 210 substrate particle measurements from the active channel, defined as the area between scour lines on both sides of the stream. By systematically spacing these transects and randomly locating sample reaches, the resulting descriptive statistics offer reliable representations of substrate conditions.
3. Description: The text discusses Method 6801 for calculating streambed particle size distribution within a sample reach. This involves measuring 210 substrate particles in the active channel (between scour lines) from 10% of 21 transects. By taking these measurements systematically and randomly locating sample reaches, the resulting descriptive statistics provide an unbiased representation of substrate conditions within the entire reach. This method ensures accuracy and reliability in assessing streambed particle size distribution.
4. Target: The primary goal of Method 6801 is to provide a precise, systematic, and unbiased approach for measuring streambed particle size distribution within a sample reach.
5. Constraints: Method 6801 requires access to the active channel area and sufficient time to take measurements from all necessary transects in order to ensure accurate representation of substrate conditions. Additionally, users must follow the recommended data collection method for streambed particle sizes and carefully consider the placement of sample reaches and transects within the study area.
