2. Abstract:
Multiple-pass removal depletion methods have been commonly used to estimate salmonid abundances in small streams. However, these methods have a large degree of within-year variability among site estimates, which does not allow for reliable examination of abundance at larger spatial scales. To address this issue, single-pass indices were found to be preferable as they track true abundance over time and perform well in predicting abundances for salmonid populations in small streams. The text also highlights the bias associated with depletion-removal estimates for salmonids in small stream systems, which can result in underestimation of true abundance due to an overestimation of capture probability during subsequent passes. Results from trend analyses indicate that first pass catch data provide similar interpretations of watershed-wide abundance trends as removal-depletion estimates, suggesting that using first-pass catch rather than multi-pass depletion estimates is a more reliable method for examining long-term reach trajectories in watersheds.
3. Description:
The text describes the limitations of multiple-pass removal depletion methods for estimating salmonid abundances at larger spatial scales due to their high degree of within-year variability among site estimates. The authors note that single-pass indices have been found to perform well in predicting abundances for salmonid populations in small streams and are preferable to absolute estimates as they track true abundance over time. The text also highlights studies documenting biases associated with depletion-removal estimates for salmonids in small stream systems, which can result in underestimation of true abundance due to an overestimation of capture probability during subsequent passes. Results from trend analyses indicate that first pass catch data provide similar interpretations of watershed-wide abundance trends as removal-depletion estimates, suggesting that using first-pass catch data is a more reliable method for examining long-term reach trajectories in watersheds.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the method described in the text is to find a reliable and efficient way to estimate salmonid abundances at larger spatial scales, while addressing the limitations and biases associated with multiple-pass removal depletion methods.
5. Constraints:
One constraint for the current method is the availability and accuracy of first-pass catch data. Additionally, the text notes that further research is needed to determine whether single-pass indices can accurately estimate salmonid abundances at even larger spatial scales.
