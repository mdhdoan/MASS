  "abstractText": "This metric is the area of wetted off-channel habitat at different flow levels. Off-channel area at the time of survey is calculated by the River Bathymetry Toolbit (RBT)using the channel units delineated during the topographic survey (Method ID: 1258). Area of off-channel habitat is also calculated at a flow level where floodplain activation is anticipated (abovebankfull). Hydraulic modeling is used model a flow level where floodplain activation is anticipated (Method ID:4233), and the wetted area of off-channel habitat is measured. Measurement units are square meters.",
