  "abstract": " In this study, researchers aim to understand the habitat preferences of certain fish species, such as Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, and Northern Pikeminnow, in large altered systems like the Columbia River. The existing literature does not provide sufficient information about their habitat preference data during non-spawning seasons.\n\nTo address this knowledge gap, researchers plan to create a classification scheme specifically for each fish species based on their habitat stratification design. This scheme will help categorize different habitats according to their suitability for specific fish species.\n\nAdditionally, they suggest that developing a piscivore abundance model stratified by habitat type can lead to more accurate and precise abundance estimates. By doing so, they aim to improve the overall understanding of fish population dynamics in these large altered systems.\n\nIn year one of their research, they will collect fish density data by habitat type as part of their Groundwater-Runoff-Transport-Systems (GRTS) study design. This data collection will eventually allow them to create habitat-based abundance estimates for each fish species in different habitats."

  "description": " This text describes a research study focused on habitat preferences and abundance estimates for three fish species, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, and Northern Pikeminnow, in large altered systems such as the Columbia River. The researchers aim to develop a species-specific habitat preference classification scheme based on habitat stratification design, which is not well documented in existing literature.\n\nTo achieve this goal, they plan to collect fish density data by habitat type during their year one study under the umbrella of the Greater Riverina Taxonomic and Spatial Survey (GRTS). The habitat classes are outlined in the uploaded file. By stratifying piscivore abundance by habitat type, the precision of the abundance estimates could be enhanced.\n\nIn simpler terms, the researchers are attempting to understand which specific habitats each fish species prefers in large altered river systems using data collected during their study. They believe that this information will lead to more accurate fish population estimates when considering habitat preferences. The design of the study includes the collection of fish density data across various habitats, allowing for the development of habitat-based abundance estimates."

  "constraints": " The text discusses the development of a habitat preference classification scheme for species such as Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, and Northern Pikeminnow in large altered systems like the Columbia River. The following constraints can be identified from the text:\n\n1. Data on habitat preference for the mentioned species is limited, especially outside of spawning periods.\n2. A habitat stratification design will be used to develop a species-specific habitat preference classification scheme.\n3. It is suggested that a piscivore abundance model stratified by habitat type could improve the precision of abundance estimates.\n4. The year one GRTS study design includes the collection of fish density by habitat type, allowing for the development of habitat-based abundance estimates.\n\nThese constraints are stated throughout the text and do not require further explanation. No code is provided in the text."
