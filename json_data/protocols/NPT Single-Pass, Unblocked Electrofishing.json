  "background": "Single-pass backpack electrofishing is a useful technique for evaluating presence-absence and coarse-scale relative abundance of fish species within wadeable streams while facilitating specimen procurement for tagging or genetic sampling purposes. This survey method is of particular value when sampling small streams which lack sufficient depth or pool frequency to snorkel effectively.",

  "assumptions": "<p>Capture efficiencies may vary profoundly between survey sites exhibiting dissimilar site-scale covariates (wetted width and depth, habitat and substrate composition, gradient, LWD and macrophyte density, etc.). Capture efficiencies are also affected by variables such as species age class/size structure, water temperature and lighting (intensity/glare/shade) at time of survey, equipment maintenance and survey staff.</p>\r\n",
