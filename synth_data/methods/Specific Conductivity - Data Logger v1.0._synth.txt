2. Abstract:
Anadromous salmonid populations in the Columbia River Basin have experienced significant declines, leading to several listings under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). To address this concern, a comprehensive monitoring strategy is necessary to reduce uncertainties surrounding these declines and develop effective recovery plans. This method proposes continuously monitoring seven key water quality attributes identified by the UCMS at integrator sites, located downstream of each population or subpopulation's distribution. By adhering to Data Quality Level A standards and coupling monitoring stations with associated flow gauges, this strategy enables researchers to assess the impact of streamflow on water quality attributes and ensure reliable ESA assessment data.

3. Description:
The Columbia River Basin is home to anadromous salmonids that have exhibited alarming declines over the past 30 years, with multiple populations now protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). A robust monitoring strategy must be implemented to minimize uncertainties and facilitate recovery planning for these species. Current and historical monitoring programs typically focus on specific management actions' effects and are most suitable for analyzing data at the subpopulation or population level. However, the ESA requires assessments of species and their habitats across multiple spatial scales.

The UCMS recommends continuously monitoring seven water quality attributes (temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus) at integrator sitesâ€”monitoring sites located downstream of each population or subpopulation's distribution. Integrator sites facilitate assessments of the overall water quality affecting each population or subpopulation.

Monitoring stations should be equipped with devices for continuous measurement of these attributes, following manufacturers' guidelines for deployment and calibration. These monitoring stations should be co-located with flow gauges operated by the USGS or WDOE to evaluate the impact of streamflow on water quality attributes. Data accuracy must meet Data Quality Level A standards defined by the Oregon Watershed Plan Water Quality Monitoring Technical Guidebook (2001).

4. Target:
The primary focus is to implement a comprehensive monitoring strategy for anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin, ensuring reliable data collection and compliance with ESA requirements.

5. Constraints:
- Adherence to specific Data Quality Level A standards
- Coordination with USGS or WDOE for flow gauge operation and co-location
- Equipment costs related to monitoring stations and devices
- Regular maintenance and calibration of monitoring equipment.
