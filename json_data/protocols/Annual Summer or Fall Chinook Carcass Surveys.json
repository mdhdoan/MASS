  "background": "Carcass surveys for summer/fall Chinook (Oncorhynchustshawytscha) are conducted annually throughout many of the river systems in Washington state. Carcass surveys generally occur contemporaneously with redd survey efforts. A single float survey serves the dual purpose of allowing for enumeration of redds while collecting carcasses for data collection. For additional information regarding summer/fall Chinook redd surveys,please consult Protocol ID#: 3276. Carcass survey data are combined with additional information (e.g. redd counts) to monitor the status and trends ofChinook species.Float surveys for carcass recoveries are conducted each week during the spawning period, which is typicallyfrom lateSeptember to mid November. Carcass recovery objectives are 20% of the estimated spawner abundance. Carcasses aresampled for origin, marks (e.g. adipose-fin clip), tags (e.g. CWT, PIT), length (e.g. POH, FKL), sex, genetics, scales (NOR only), and recovery location and date.",
