  "abstractText": "A fin clip is a simple external mark to create a known subset of a population of fish. When clipping fins, a portion is removed in a single cut. Fins can be clipped using a variety of tools, such as scissors, wire cutters, or hole punches. Because procedures are quick and don't require special equipment, they are inexpensive.Clipped fins may regenerate, but usually remain recognizable as the fish ages. But, because there are a limited number of combinations of fins to clip and there is uncertainty due to regeneration, the use of fin clips is limited in some studies. Typically, they are used to distinguish one set of fish from another, such as in a hatchery setting.",
