  "abstract": " The text describes a method used by the California Department of Water Resources to collect and process water samples for quality analysis from surface waters using a van Dorn sampler. This approach is important as it allows for determining the concentration of various parameters at a specific moment in time for any given body of water. Proper implementation of this technique ensures valid and comparable results, addressing potential inconsistencies or inaccuracies that could arise without following established procedures."

  "description": " The provided text describes a method used by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) for collecting and processing representative water samples, referred to as grab samples, from surface waters for water quality analysis using a van Dorn sampler. These grab samples serve to determine the concentration of analytical parameters at a specific point in time for a given water body.\n\nThe process begins by considering general aspects important to obtaining valid and comparable results. Proper sampling technique is essential, as poor techniques can lead to inaccurate data. The van Dorn sampler, which is used in this method, is designed for depth-integrated or discrete water sampling from both still and flowing bodies of water. This type of sampler incorporates a bottle with a hinged, spring-loaded intake mechanism that draws a water sample into the bottle when the intake mechanism is closed.\n\nTo collect a grab sample using this method, follow these procedures:\n1. Ensure that all necessary equipment, such as the van Dorn sampler, preservatives, and containers for storing samples are prepared and ready.\n2. Navigate to the sampling location and position the boat or other platform close enough to the water's edge to facilitate easy access.\n3. Prior to taking a sample, clean the intake mechanism of the van Dorn sampler with distilled water or a suitable preservative solution to prevent contamination.\n4. Lower the van Dorn sampler into the water to the desired depth and allow it to collect water for several seconds before closing the intake mechanism. This process will fill the bottle with water from that specific depth.\n5. After collecting the sample, immediately secure the bottle in a preservative to maintain sample integrity. Proper preservatives vary depending on the analytical parameters being measured. Commonly used preservatives include sodium thiosulfate for dissolved oxygen measurements and hydrochloric acid for pH measurements.\n6. Once back at the laboratory, process the samples according to established protocols for each specific analytical parameter.\n\nIn conclusion, this method outlines the importance of proper technique when collecting grab samples for water quality analysis using a van Dorn sampler in California surface waters. The procedures described are crucial for obtaining valid and comparable results to assess the water quality at a given point in time."
