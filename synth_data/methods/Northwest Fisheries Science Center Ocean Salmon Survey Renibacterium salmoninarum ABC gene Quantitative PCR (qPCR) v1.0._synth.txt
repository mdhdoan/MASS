2. Abstract: Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a powerful method for measuring the number of copies of a specific DNA target in a sample. This technique uses fluorescently labeled probes that can be detected optically during the amplification process. By comparing results to a standard curve, researchers can accurately determine the quantity of DNA target present. The described application focuses on using qPCR with R. salmoninarum DNA samples and an ABI 7500 real-time PCR machine. This method requires careful attention to pipetting accuracy and relies on separate protocols for sample preparation and DNA extraction.

3. Description: Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a sensitive and accurate technique for measuring the number of copies of a specific DNA target in a sample. The process involves using fluorescently labeled probes that can be detected optically during the amplification process, allowing researchers to monitor the accumulation of PCR product in real-time. To determine the quantity of DNA target present, the results are compared to a standard curve generated by simultaneous amplification and analysis of serial dilutions of a standard DNA sample with known concentration.

The described application focuses on using qPCR for measuring the severity of infection in known positive R. salmoninarum DNA samples using an ABI 7500 real-time PCR machine. This method requires careful attention to pipetting accuracy, as small errors can significantly impact the results. The text also mentions separate protocols for sample preparation and DNA extraction, which are crucial steps in ensuring accurate and reproducible results.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to measure the severity of infection in known positive R. salmoninarum DNA samples using quantitative PCR (qPCR).
5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method include the need for meticulous attention to pipetting accuracy and access to a compatible real-time PCR machine, such as the ABI 7500, as well as following separate protocols for sample preparation and DNA extraction.
