2. Abstract: The text describes a method for installing sensors in environments prone to flooding. By finding and utilizing large, immobile rocks or boulders as anchor points, researchers can ensure their sensors remain protected and in place during high water levels. This approach increases the likelihood of successful long-term data collection by minimizing damage and dislodging risks due to floods.
3. Description: To implement this method effectively, first identify a large rock or boulder that remains immobile during floods and is easily distinguishable for future site visits. Select rocks that protrude at least a foot above the low flow water surface and are wide enough to shield the sensor from moving debris. Ideal downstream sites have calm waters and smaller substrate sizes, as large substrates may move and dislodge sensors during floods. Attach the sensor to a flat, submerged surface on the downstream side of the rock, ensuring it remains in or near flowing water throughout the year. In low-gradient meadows with limited suitable substrates, seek steeper channels up or downstream for attachment opportunities. Avoid using large logs as they may decay over time.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to identify suitable locations and techniques for installing sensors in flood-prone areas while maximizing their durability and longevity.
5. Constraints: This method requires the availability of appropriately sized, immobile rocks or boulders at the target site. It may not be applicable in areas with unstable or minimal substrate material. Additionally, potential anchor points must provide a flat, submerged surface for successful sensor attachment.
