2. Abstract: This method discusses the use of Teledyne Iscos 3700 Standard Portable Sampler, a programmable liquid sampler designed for general-purpose or priority-pollutant sampling. The text covers the necessary considerations when setting up the ISCO equipment, including landowner permission, accessibility, stable placement, and proximity to stream gaging stations. Additionally, it explains the importance of programming the unit specifically for each site, as well as regular site visits to ensure proper operation during varying weather conditions and water levels.
3. Description: The Teledyne Iscos 3700 Standard Portable Sampler is a programmable liquid sampler that offers extensive sampling capabilities, making it suitable for general-purpose or priority-pollutant sampling. It also provides storm-paced sampling capabilities designed to meet EPA requirements for storm water runoff monitoring. Before installing the ISCO equipment at a new sediment site, several factors must be taken into account: landowner permission, accessibility for retrieval of samples, stable placement on the channel and bank, and proximity to stream gaging stations (if possible). Metal housing shelters are fabricated to protect the ISCOs from the elements and vandalism. The sampler is programmed specifically for each site after installation, which involves testing out different combinations of volume suctioned and lengths of pull until the right combination is found. Site visits are made during the middle of the cycle to check on the operation and make any necessary adjustments due to changing water levels or freezing temperatures.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide guidelines for setting up, programming, and maintaining the Teledyne Iscos 3700 Standard Portable Sampler for effective liquid sampling in various environmental conditions.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method include dependence on landowner permission, accessibility challenges, unstable channel and bank placement, and limitations related to stream gaging station proximity. Additionally, the method requires regular site visits for monitoring and adjustments due to varying water levels and freezing temperatures.
