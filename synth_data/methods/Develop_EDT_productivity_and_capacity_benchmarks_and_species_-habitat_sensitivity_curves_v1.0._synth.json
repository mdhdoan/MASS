  "abstract": " The Environmental Dynamic Model (EDT) is a scientific approach used to evaluate the potential habitat for a specific species by considering the impact of environmental conditions on the productivity and capacity of that habitat. This model sets benchmarks as theoretical natural limits for survival and density based on ideal habitat conditions, but recognizes that real-life conditions can be different due to site-specific circumstances.\n\nThe EDT method uses species-habitat relationships to adjust optimal benchmark performance by taking into account local site conditions. These rules are sensitivity curves specific to each life stage and environmental attribute, which degrade the theoretical benchmarks to reflect actual local conditions. As a result, fish performance in their environment is usually below the optimal benchmark levels, even in pristine environments.\n\nThe sensitivity curves serve as a systematic tool for quantifying survival conditions by comparing performance in the local environment with benchmarks, ensuring that productivity and capacity values are:\n1. Bounded by the biological limits of the species\n2. Scaled consistently across time, space, and life stages, and\n3. Scaled consistently with the benchmark values.\n\nWhen parameterizing an EDT model, one selects from existing salmon and steelhead sensitivity curves developed by ICF and others. These hypotheses about how survival is affected by environmental conditions are based on scientific literature but remain subject to continuous evolution as our understanding advances."

  "description": " The Environmental Dynamics (EDT) model is a deterministic approach used to assess habitat potential for a specific target species by evaluating the influence of habitat conditions on productivity and capacity benchmarks. EDT benchmarks signify the theoretical natural limits for survival and density of a species under optimal natural conditions. These benchmarks take into account various life stage-specific factors, such as fecundity, ideal productivity, typical life stage duration, and maximum density (Lestelle et al., 2004).\n\nThe relationships between species and their habitats are employed to adjust the optimal benchmark performance based on site-specific conditions. These site-specific conditions are characterized in the model's habitat environment. EDT model sensitivity curves are a set of life stage-specific rules, which modify theoretical benchmarks based on local conditions (Lestelle et al., 2004).\n\nThese sensitivity curves represent the degree to which environmental attributes in the model impact species survival. They systematically quantify survival conditions for any reach by computing performance in the local environment relative to the benchmarks. This procedure ensures that productivity and capacity values computed for each life history segment: a) adhere to the biological limits of the species, b) are consistent across time, space, and life stage, and c) align with the benchmark values (Lestelle et al., 2004).\n\nTypically, EDT model parameterization involves choosing one of seven existing salmon and steelhead sensitivity curves developed by ICF and other research organizations. These sensitivity curves are based on recent scientific literature and reflect our current understanding of how survival is affected by environmental conditions (Lestelle et al., 2004). They should be regarded as hypotheses about the impact of habitat conditions on survival, considering that scientific knowledge continues to evolve.\n\nHere's a more detailed description using terms from the text:\n\nThe EDT model assesses the potential habitat for target species by analyzing the relationship between habitat conditions and productivity and capacity benchmarks. Benchmarks represent theoretical natural limits for survival and density under ideal natural conditions. These benchmarks are life stage-specific and consider factors like fecundity, ideal productivity, typical life stage duration, and maximum density (Lestelle et al., 2004).\n\nThe relationships between species and their habitats are utilized to adjust the optimal benchmark performance based on site-specific conditions in the model's habitat environment. The EDT model uses sensitivity curves that represent life stage-specific rules to modify theoretical benchmarks based on local conditions (Lestelle et al., 2004).\n\nThese sensitivity curves provide a systematic means for quantifying survival conditions by computing performance in the local environment relative to the benchmarks. This ensures that productivity and capacity values computed for each life history segment: a) conform to the biological limits of the species, b) are consistent across time, space, and life stage, and c) align with the benchmark values (Lestelle et al., 2004).\n\nWhen selecting EDT model parameters, one of seven existing salmon and steelhead sensitivity curves is chosen. These curves are based on recent scientific literature and represent our current understanding of how survival is impacted by environmental conditions (Lestelle et al., 2004). They should be regarded as hypotheses about the effect of habitat conditions on survival, as scientific knowledge continues to evolve."

  "constraints": " The text discusses the Environmental Dynamics Model (EDT), which is a deterministic model used to characterize habitat potential for a target species by evaluating the effect of habitat conditions on productivity and capacity benchmarks. The following are the constraints stated in the text:\n\n1. Biological Limits: Productivity and capacity values computed for each life history segment are bounded by the biological limits of the species. (Lestelle et al. 2004)\n2. Scaling Consistently: Productivity and capacity values are scaled consistently across time, space, and life stage, and are scaled consistently with the benchmark values. (Lestelle et al. 2004)\n3. Site-specific conditions: Species-habitat relationships are used to adjust the optimal benchmark performance to account for site-specific conditions in the model habitat environment. (Lestelle et al. 2004)\n4. Sensitivity Curves: The sensitivity curves adjust the theoretical benchmarks downward to reflect local conditions, resulting in fish performance that is typically less than the benchmark optimal levels even in pristine environments. (Lestelle et al. 2004)\n5. Scientific Understanding: The sensitivity curves are best thought of as hypotheses about how survival is affected by environmental conditions because scientific understanding is continuously evolving. (Lestelle et al. 2004)\n6. Anthropogenic Constraints: While the text mentions local geology, climate and biology as inherent constraints, it does not explicitly state anthropogenic constraints as a constraint in the method, but acknowledges that they are independent of anthropogenic influences. (Lestelle et al. 2004)\n\nCode generation is not applicable to this text as it only discusses the concepts and limitations of the EDT model."
