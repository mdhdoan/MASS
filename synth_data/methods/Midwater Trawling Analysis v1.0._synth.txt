2. Abstract: This text describes a method for estimating fish density using trawling data, which is necessary to calculate the age-specific proportions needed for the final population estimate even when hydroacoustic methods are used. The minimum and maximum depths of the kokanee layer vary throughout the lake, affecting the volume of water sampled and requiring a more complex method for calculating the proportion of each age class in the sample.
3. Description: After conducting a trawling event, the data must be analyzed to estimate fish density. This is necessary because the age-specific proportions needed for the final population estimate are obtained from trawling, even when hydroacoustic methods are used. The volume of water sampled varies by transect due to differences in the minimum and maximum depths of the kokanee layer throughout the lake. As a result, the proportion of each age class is not simply the percentage of fish collected. Instead, a more complex method must be used to estimate fish density from the trawling data, accounting for variations in water volume sampled by transect.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to estimate fish density using trawling data, with a specific focus on calculating age-specific proportions.
5. Constraints: A potential constraint for this method is the need for accurate depth measurements throughout the lake in order to accurately calculate the volume of water sampled and therefore the proportion of each age class. Additionally, the method requires sufficient trawling data to estimate fish density with a desired level of precision.
