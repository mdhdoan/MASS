  "abstractText": "Partial capture traps and mark-recapture methods are frequently used to monitor downstream migrating juvenile fish to assess the performance and status of anadromous salmonids. A variety of important fish population criteria can be obtained from these methodologies; including abundance, migration timing, and survival. And when paired with adult abundance, high-level indicators such as smolt-to-adult survival and smolts-per-adult can be estimated.",
