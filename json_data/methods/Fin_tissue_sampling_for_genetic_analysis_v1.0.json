  "abstractText": "The collection method will be nonlethal fin clips to minimize impact on at-risk wild and natural populations. Hatchery samples are generally parr or presmolts shortly prior to release. Field samples involve parr or smolts; for steelhead, we work closely with local biologists to avoid collecting resident rainbow trout (except when residents are specifically targeted for parentage analysis). Field collections are made with seine nets and single-pass electrofishing.",
