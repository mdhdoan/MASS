2. Abstract:
To estimate juvenile salmonid migration, a mark-recapture method is necessary since fry are too small for PIT tagging. The text describes a staining technique using Bismarck Brown that can be used as an alternative mark-recapture method. Every 3-4 days, a subsample of up to 300 individuals is selected from the total trap catch and stained in a dye solution for one hour. Maintaining appropriate oxygen levels and temperature is crucial for effective staining. The mark lasts for 3-4 days, but changing the dye concentration or exposure time can adjust its lifespan. This technique provides a feasible alternative to PIT tagging for estimating juvenile salmonid migration.

3. Description:
The method described in the text is a mark-recapture technique that uses Bismarck Brown stain to estimate juvenile salmonid migration. The necessity of this method arises from the fact that fry are too small for PIT tagging, which requires a minimum size of 60 mm FL. Rotary screw traps are used to collect juvenile fish, and every 3-4 days, a subsample of up to 300 individuals is selected for staining. The fish are placed in a bath containing a 0.4g/16 L solution of Bismarck Brown stain for one hour. Four battery-powered aerators maintain oxygen saturation, and ice packs keep the temperature within 1-2C of river temperature. Properly stained fish exhibit a visible mark that lasts for 3-4 days, but changing the dye concentration or exposure time can adjust the lifespan of the mark.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to estimate juvenile salmonid migration using a feasible alternative to PIT tagging.

5. Constraints:
This method has some constraints, including the requirement for appropriate oxygen levels and temperature during staining. Additionally, maintaining a subsample size of up to 300 individuals every 3-4 days may be labor-intensive and require additional resources. Finally, adjusting the dye concentration or exposure time to change the mark's lifespan requires further experimentation and calibration.
