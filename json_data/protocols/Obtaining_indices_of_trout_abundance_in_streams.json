  "background": "This protocol was developed to track temporal and spatial trends in trout abundance in stream reaches of watersheds that support salmonid populations that are of importance to the Coeur dAlene Tribe. Monitoring abundance trajectories will aid in the evaluation of whether reach-scale stream conditions are improving or declining for local trout populations. The detection of declining trends or persistently low numbers of fish at the reach scale may signal localized degradation or deficiencies in habitat conditions that need to be addressed and prioritized for prospective habitat improvements. The tracking of temporal changes in the reach-scaledistribution of trout populations will also permit an examination of expansion rates to evaluate whether newly created suitable habitat (e.g., barrier removal) is undergoing colonization. Overall, monitoring reach-scale changes in the distribution of trout populations should reveal whether connectivity is improving to transform patchy distributions to more resilient, robust metapopulation structures. This protocol is intended to be used for populations of eitherwestslope cutthroat trout, redband trout, brook trout, or bull trout.",
