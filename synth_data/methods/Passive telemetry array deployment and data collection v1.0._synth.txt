2. Abstract: The text describes the use of a passive telemetry array to evaluate the impact of Libby dam operations on the movement patterns of sturgeon and burbot in Kootenay Lake, Canada, and extending upstream into Montana. This method is necessary as it allows for monitoring the effects of the dam on fish populations over a large geographic area, without requiring physical tracking or interference with the animals. The passive telemetry array provides important data on how these operations affect focal species, contributing to better management and conservation efforts.

3. Description: A passive telemetry array is an unobtrusive monitoring system used to track the movements of aquatic organisms. In this case, it is deployed in Kootenay Lake, extending upstream into Montana, with a focus on evaluating the effects of Libby dam operations on sturgeon and burbot populations. By using this method, researchers can gather data on large-scale movements and migration patterns of these focal species in relation to the dam operations. This detailed information helps inform management strategies and conservation efforts for maintaining healthy fish populations and ecosystems.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to assess and understand the impact of Libby dam operations on sturgeon, burbot, and other focal species in Kootenay Lake and its upstream areas.

5. Constraints: Although passive telemetry arrays offer many benefits, they do have limitations. These systems rely on the availability and functionality of transmitters attached to individual animals. If transmitter signal range is limited or if signals are obstructed by geographic features or other factors, data accuracy may be affected. Additionally, passive telemetry arrays require regular maintenance and upkeep to ensure their effectiveness over time.
