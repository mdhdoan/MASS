  "abstractText": "Canopy cover is assessed using streambank transects that parallel bank restoration structures, including structures where live willow cuttings and other live plant materials have been installed such as vegetated soil lifts, as well as other bank treatments that do not incorporate live plant material. Canopy cover is measured by visually assessing woody vegetation percent cover along a length of streambank and/or face of the streambank structure at specified distance intervals. Canopy cover measurements are used to evaluate the establishment of woody vegetation that will provide long-term natural bank stability and the progression of restoration cover types toward the desired condition. This information is also used to determine potential maintenance needs.",
