2. Abstract: This method aims to address the lack of detailed information on habitat preference data for certain fish species in large altered systems like the Columbia River. By developing a species-specific habitat preference classification scheme and utilizing a GRTS study design, this approach will enable the collection of fish density by habitat type. The ultimate goal is to create more precise abundance estimates through a piscivore abundance model stratified by habitat type, contributing to better management and conservation strategies for these fish populations.
3. Description: The text highlights the need for improved habitat preference data for fish species such as Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, and Northern Pikeminnow in large altered systems like the Columbia River. A species-specific habitat preference classification scheme will be developed based on a habitat stratification design to address this issue. This approach may benefit from a piscivore abundance model stratified by habitat type, which could enhance the precision of abundance estimates. The text mentions that a year one GRTS (Generalized Random Tessellation Sampling) study design will be implemented, enabling the collection of fish density data broken down by habitat type. This information will then be used to develop habitat-based abundance estimates, contributing to better management and conservation strategies for these fish populations.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to create a species-specific habitat preference classification scheme and improve abundance estimates for certain fish species in large altered systems through the use of a GRTS study design and piscivore abundance model.
5. Constraints: The success of this method depends on the availability and accuracy of existing habitat data, as well as the ability to effectively implement the GRTS study design and piscivore abundance model in the field. Additionally, potential limitations in resources such as time, funding, and personnel may impact the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.
