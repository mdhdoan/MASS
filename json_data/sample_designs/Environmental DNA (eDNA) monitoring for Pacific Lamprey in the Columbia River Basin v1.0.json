  "description": "<p>Pacific Lamprey (<em>Entosphenus</em>&nbsp;<em>tridentatus)</em>&nbsp;is an anadromous fish whose&nbsp;distribution&nbsp;extends&nbsp;along the West Coast&nbsp;of North America as far South as Baja, Mexico and North along the Pacific Rim to Alaska, Russia&nbsp;and&nbsp;Japan. Since the 1970s, populations have declined drastically,&nbsp;and distribution has been&nbsp;greatly reduced from their historic range.&nbsp;Factors that have contributed to this decline include man made passage barriers, dams, water quality, contaminants, habitat degradation, predation, and climate change impacts. Monitoring of environmental DNA (eDNA) is a cost effective, efficient, noninvasive tool that can be used&nbsp;to monitor translocation programs as part of a pre- and post- release monitoring program, recolonization after barrier removals,&nbsp;presence/absence in translocation and control streams, seasonal differences in occupancy, and provides a method to distinguish genus - Entosphenus/ Lampetra&nbsp;(Carim et al. 2017;Grote and Carim 2017). EDNA is useful in detecting invasive species, species present in low abundance&nbsp;and to monitor&nbsp;the extent of a species ranges (Carim et al. 2016; Ostberg et al. 2019).&nbsp;To develop an eDNA assay specific to Pacific lamprey, DNA of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) of Pacific Lamprey and unidentified freshwater lamprey was sequenced (Carim et al. 2016).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Objectives</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Determine which Columbia River Basin tributaries are utilized by Pacific Lamprey as indicated by the presence of Pacific Lamprey environmntal DNA (eDNA).</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Monitor the status and trends of Paific Lamprey distribution throughout the Columbia River Basin using environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Monitor Pacific Lamprey restoration/reintroduction methods (e.g. translocation) within the Columbia River Basin using environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n",
