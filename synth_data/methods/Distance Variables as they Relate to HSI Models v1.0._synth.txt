2. Abstract: The use of Cover type and HSI models in Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) transects determines the specific variables to be used in data collection for long-term monitoring of the Precious Lands Area. This method focuses on using four distance variables, including Distance to Roost Cover, Distance to Escape Cover, Distance to Perch, and Distance to Exposed Rock, in grassland and shrub cover types. Surveys will be conducted to assess long-term trends in plant community health, weedy encroachment, limiting factors for wildlife, and identify/monitor areas of habitat degradation. This method is crucial for preserving the biodiversity and health of the Precious Lands Area.

3. Description: The text outlines a method that uses HSI models in conjunction with HEP transects to evaluate the baseline condition of the Precious Lands Area, with long-term monitoring based on HEP data collection procedures. Four distance variables are used in grassland and shrub cover types, namely Distance to Roost Cover, Distance to Escape Cover, Distance to Perch, and Distance to Exposed Rock. These variables allow for the assessment of the area's habitats and identification of any degradation. Surveys will be conducted to monitor long-term trends in plant community health, weedy encroachment, limiting factors for wildlife, and areas of habitat degradation. This method is crucial for preserving the biodiversity and health of the Precious Lands Area over time.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is long-term monitoring and preservation of the Precious Lands Area through the use of HSI models, HEP transects, and distance variables in data collection.

5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need for regular and ongoing surveys to collect accurate data, as well as the potential limitations in accurately measuring distance variables in certain terrain or vegetation conditions. Additionally, there may be challenges in identifying and addressing limiting factors for wildlife populations, which could impact the success of this preservation method.
