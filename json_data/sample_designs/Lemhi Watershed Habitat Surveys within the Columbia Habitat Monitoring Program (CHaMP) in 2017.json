  "description": "<p>\u200b</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHaMP&nbsp;is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010).&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;salmonids&nbsp;and/or their habitat. The implementation of&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;56.3,&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;57, and&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;3.&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel (see section 1.6), at least 9 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lemhi&rsquo;s&nbsp;primary objective was to estimate habitat condition for the&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;subbasin, and estimate the habitat condition in each of 18 priority&nbsp;drainages&nbsp;(see strata list). The&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;status and trends sampling design consisted of 45 unique sites sampled over three years (the standard&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;design) and was supplemented with 72 sites funded by the&nbsp;ISEMP&nbsp;program.&nbsp; The Steelhead (Snake River Basin&nbsp;DPS) -&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;River and &nbsp;the Chinook Salmon (Snake River Spring/Summer-run&nbsp;ESU) -&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;River were the populations of interest. &nbsp;The original rationale was to allocate annual sites across the smaller tributaries to get a broad coverage of the diversity of habitat types, and use more rotating panel sites in the larger tributaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2017 Design Updates: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Programmatic changes to the CHaMP field sampling efforts triggered changing all annual panel sites to rotating panel sites. The following sites were shifted:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-035679&nbsp;(annual-Agency to RP1-Agency, Use order 1 to 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-254415 (annual Big Eightmile to RP2-Big Eightmile, Use order 1 to 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BigSprings-5 (annual Big Springs to RP3-Big Springs, Use order 1 to 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-001487&nbsp;(annual Big Timber to RP1-Big Timber, Use order 1 to 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-049615 (annual Canyon to RP2-Canyon, Use order 1 to 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-048559 (annual Hayden to RP3-Hayden, Use order 1 to 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-026031 (annual Lemhi&nbsp;upper mainstem to RP2&nbsp;-Lemhi&nbsp;upper mainstem, Use order 1 to 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, Site 050639 (Hawley-RP1&nbsp;is not perennial and will be rejected and replaced with another Hawley site). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Lee Creek Extended site (different GRTS design) CBW05583-353711 will be rejected as non-anadromous and effort will instead be put into the Lower Mainstem&nbsp;Lemhi stratum (RP1). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Block counts to adjust for all changes listed above were made, along with Use Orders. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2016 Design Updates: </strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were no changes to the study design. &nbsp;The 2015 design was registered to cm.org</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2015 Sample Design Update Notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All core&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;designs were updated to accommodate effort that will go towards the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://isemp.egnyte.com/dl/EcV8YyGyV5\" style=\"font-size: 12px; color: rgb(0, 64, 108); text-decoration: none; line-height: 16.7999992370605px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">10% repeat design for&nbsp;CHaMP</a>. &nbsp; The design update will result in 3 annual sites from the active design (e.g. 2014) and move one to each rotating panel. &nbsp;This will result in a net freeing of 2 visits each year that can be used to revisit 2 sites. &nbsp;This change preserves the annual sites within the design and adjusts the frequency of sampling. &nbsp;2 sites slated for sampling in the current year (e.g. 2015) will be randomly selected for repeat sampling.&nbsp;Strata were selected randomly for the Lemhi since no strata have &gt;1 annual site per strata. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sites moved from annual to rotating panels included:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-207711, Bohannon, Use Order 1 to Rotating Panel 1, Use Order 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-064351, Kenney, Use Order 1 to Rotating Panel 2, Use Order 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LEM00002-00001D, Little Springs, Use Order 1 to Rotating Panel 3, Use Order 1. Note that I believe although this site is not a &#39;CBW&#39; master sample point, that the original design included these opportunistic sites because the Little Springs stratum is so small. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1/23/17: During the review of 2016 site evaluations we found site 440159 in a Wimpey Extra block was sampled in 2014 but not moved to the appropriate panel. &nbsp;We moved sites 440159 and 125791 (also evaluated for RP1 replacement) to RP1 Wimpey for both the 2014 and 2015 designs. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2014 Sample Design Update Notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sampling was reduced to 25 sites/year due to a decrease in ISEMP&nbsp;funding for habitat sampling in the Lemhi. &nbsp;In previous years, ISEMP&nbsp;supplemented the base CHaMP&nbsp;habitat sampling. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All 11 annual sites will be kept and the first use order site within each sub-watershed for each rotating panel will be kept. In smaller watersheds, there will not be an annual sample. &nbsp;This will result in 3-4 sites sampled per watershed across the 3 year CHaMP&nbsp;panel rotation. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\u200b\u200bStrata updates in 2014:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) The following sub-watersheds will be dropped due to low fish densities, low priority status or a low likelihood they will ever be reconnected.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Beaver Valley Creek (Hayden)</li>\r\n\t<li>Little Eightmile Creek</li>\r\n\t<li>Pattee Creek</li>\r\n\t<li>Mill Creek</li>\r\n\t<li>Eighteenmile Creek</li>\r\n\t<li>Texas Creek</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) The Lemhi Mainstem will be split into two strata: Upper Lemhi Mainstem (above Hayden Creek) and Lower Lemhi Mainstem (below Hayden Creek). &nbsp;Existing CHaMP sites that have been previously sampled will still be sampled in these areas as per the sample plan outlined in #1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) Almost all sampling will take place at a subset of existing sites, except for a new site needed in Wimpey Creek and new GRTS draws for Lee Creek and Pratt Creeks, which were not previously sampled in 2011-2013. &nbsp;The GRTS draws for these two strata will be described in separate Designs in the Sample Designer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) Note that the original GRTS use order was used to prioritize the top site in each Rotating Panel, ignoring the public/private designation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2013 Sample Design Update Notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200b4 sites were added to the 2013 Lemhi IMW design that were sampled as &#39;MOCK&#39; sites in 2012. &nbsp;This did not affect the status and trend sampling design and no additional GRTS sites were drawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200b<strong>2012 Sample Design Notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original rationale was to allocate annual sites across the smaller tributaries to get a broad coverage of the diversity of habitat types, and use more rotating panel sites in the larger tributaries .&nbsp; In 2012, this rationale was shifted and annual sites were increased in Hayden and the&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;mainstem.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Withington&nbsp;drainage was removed from the survey due to landowner rejections. &nbsp;A few sites were shifted among panels, but no new sites were drawn using the&nbsp;GRTS&nbsp;spsurvey&nbsp;function.&nbsp; Site changes included:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Rotating panel 1 - Hayden-Private only had 1 site in the block, so the first &#39;Extra&#39; site in Hayden-Private (CBW05583-479663) was moved to Rotating Panel 1.</li>\r\n\t<li>Rotating panel 2&nbsp;-Lemhi&nbsp;Mainstem&nbsp;site&nbsp;CBW005583-026031&nbsp;was moved to the annual panel.</li>\r\n\t<li>Rotating panel 1- Hayden site&nbsp;CBW005583-028079&nbsp;was moved to the annual panel, making two annual Hayden sites</li>\r\n\t<li>Rotating panel 1 - Hayden Creek&nbsp;CBW005583-029103&nbsp;was moved to the annual panel making three annual Hayden sites</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Rejected annual sites are listed below--these sites were left in their original panels but were replaced as needed with new sites in 2012</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Lee Creek&nbsp;CBW005583-385487&nbsp;annual, but access denied.</li>\r\n\t<li>Little&nbsp;Eightmile&nbsp;CBW005583-510383&nbsp;annual but access denied</li>\r\n\t<li>Wimpy&nbsp;CBW005583-007007&nbsp;annual, but access denied.

To best support the need for oversample sites, a block of &#39;Extra&#39; sites for each priority watershed was generated that supported the oversample needs of all panels. &nbsp;This was done when there were too few sites to allocated as oversamples to individual panels. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The general design structure was an annual panel and three panels set up on a three year cycle.&nbsp; Fifteen unique sites will be &ldquo;annual&rdquo;; remainder will be allocated to the&nbsp;3-yr. panels, 1/3 per year, for a total of 49 sites sampled per year (15 annual; 34 rotating panel).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The R code describes how each stratum&rsquo;s sample was selected, incorporating relevant legacy sites for that stratum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Master sample&nbsp;GRTS&nbsp;Input file</strong>: Lemhi_MS_20110616.txt</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Legacy sample&nbsp;GRTS&nbsp;Input file</strong>: Lemhi_Legacy_20110615.txt</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Final design file: Design file</strong>: Lemhi.design.6.17.2011.csv</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>R code</strong>:&nbsp;Lemhi&nbsp;Design.6.15.r</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strat.panel function version:</strong>&nbsp;Stevens.strat.panel6.r</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Design Documentation Files:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://isemp.egnyte.com/h-s/20140429/ZhhD0PonKr\">Lemhi_DesignFiles.zip</a></p>\r\n",
