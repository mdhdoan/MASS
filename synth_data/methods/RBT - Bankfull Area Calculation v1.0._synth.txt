2. Abstract: The River Bathymetry Toolkit (RBT) is a suite of Geographic Information System (GIS) tools designed to analyze river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM). RBT, developed by North Arrow Research in association with ESSA and the Rocky Mountain Research Station, allows users to model and measure river channels. The toolkit, which operates within ESRI's ArcGIS Desktop software, provides various functionalities such as detrending DEMs, cutting user-defined cross-sections, defining hydraulic geometry, computing stream gradients, mapping longitudinal variations in channel metrics, and analyzing water depth distribution. RBT uses data collected through methods like LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys. By employing the CHaMP- Topographic Point Collection Methods for measurement data collection, RBT serves as a comprehensive solution for river channel analysis.

3. Description: The River Bathymetry Toolkit (RBT) is a suite of GIS tools developed by North Arrow Research, ESSA, and the Rocky Mountain Research Station, designed to operate within ESRI's ArcGIS Desktop software. RBT enables users to analyze river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM), which can be derived from airborne remote sensing methods like LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys.

RBT offers several features, including detrending DEMs to remove the longitudinal valley slope and cutting user-defined cross-sections through the DEM. The toolkit also allows users to define hydraulic geometry in each cross-section (e.g., bankfull width/depth) and compute stream gradient and sinuosity. Users can cut long profiles down the length of a channel, map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics, and vary the water level in detrended DEMs to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. RBT can locate residual pools which may be used to identify fish habitat.

To use RBT, users must first install ArcGIS Desktop since it functions as an add-in for this software. The CHaMP- Topographic Point Collection Methods provide background on the collection of measurement data analyzed by RBT.

4. Target: River channel analysis and measurement using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM) within ESRI's ArcGIS Desktop software.
5. Constraints: Requires the installation of ESRI's ArcGIS Desktop software, relies on accurate and high-resolution DEM data from sources such as LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys.
