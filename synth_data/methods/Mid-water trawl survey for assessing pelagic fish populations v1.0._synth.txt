2. Abstract: Mid-water trawling is an effective method for capturing and studying pelagic fish such as kokanee and juvenile sockeye. By utilizing an echo sounder to detect the 'fish layer' formed during nighttime hours, researchers can gather valuable data about fish populations in lakes and reservoirs. This survey method, adapted from Rieman (1992), provides crucial information on the size, age structure, abundance, and biomass of targeted species, contributing to better management and conservation efforts.
3. Description: Mid-water trawling is a fishing technique that involves towing a net through the water column to capture pelagic fish. In this study, kokanee and juvenile sockeye were the target species. These fish tend to separate during darkness and form a detectable 'fish layer' in the water column. An echo sounder is used to locate and survey this layer, providing data on fish density and distribution. The survey method was initially developed for assessing O. nerkapopulations but can be applied to other pelagic species. The collected data serves to estimate population size, age structure, abundance, biomass, and production, contributing to informed management decisions and conservation efforts.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to assess the population dynamics and characteristics of pelagic fish species in lakes and reservoirs.
5. Constraints: This method requires specialized equipment (mid-water trawl net and echo sounder) and knowledgeable operators. Additionally, it may have limited applicability in environments with low fish densities or complex bathymetry. Environmental factors such as water turbidity and weather conditions may also impact the effectiveness of this survey method.
