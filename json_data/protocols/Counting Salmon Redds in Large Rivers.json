  "background": "Redd counts in large rivers can help to describe the spatial distribution ofspawning salmon. Increases in the spatial distribution of redds can suggest that the a given population/ESU is responding positively to implemented actions. Long-termredd- count datacan also inform the spatial criteria for recoveryestablished recovery plans as well as provide important data for modeling efforts identified suchplans.",
