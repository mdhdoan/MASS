2. Abstract: Moist soil management is a crucial tool for the conservation of wetland habitats and associated wildlife. This involves managing water levels, creating disturbance, and manipulating vegetation to promote early successional wetland habitats. The study described here compares different techniques, including harrowing, broadcast seeding, drill seeding, and tillage, to determine their effectiveness in promoting Wild Millet growth and providing habitat for wetland-dependent species.
3. Description: Moist soil management is a valuable approach for treating wetland habitats and supporting associated wildlife. The ability to manage water levels, create disturbance, and manipulate vegetation to create more productive early successional wetland habitats is essential to the TD-1 project. This study focuses on four different techniques used in five wetland cells: natural establishment (Cell 1), harrowing and broadcast seeding with Wild Millet (Cell 2), tillage (Cell 3), harrowing and drill seeding with Wild Millet (Cell 4), and another instance of tillage (Cell 7). During the summer of 2018, wetland specialist McPherson harrowed Cells 2 and 4 and broadcast seeded them with Wild Millet at different rates. Both Cells 3 and 7 were tilled to suppress non-desirable vegetation and improve soil health for future plantings. Good volunteer stands of Wild Millet had established in these cells by late August, prompting the specialist to evaluate seed biomass present in the volunteer stand and compare it to the broadcast and drill seeding methods.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to assess the effectiveness of various moist soil management techniques in promoting Wild Millet growth and providing habitat for wetland-dependent species.
5. Constraints: Time and resource constraints, limitations due to Covid-19 (impacting field work), availability of specialized equipment, and variability in weather conditions and soil composition may impact the success of these methods.
