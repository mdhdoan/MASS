2. Abstract: The RBT is a suite of Geographic Information System (GIS) tools designed for analyzing river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). These DEMs can be obtained from airborne remote sensing techniques like LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys. The tool calculates profile metrics at regular intervals along the site, with an option to customize interval distance. For 2011 CHaMP data, the interval distance was set to 0.5m. This method also includes a filtering mechanism that removes outliers from the dataset to improve accuracy in metric calculation.
3. Description: The RBT tools are integrated into ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software and facilitate detailed river channel analysis using DEMs derived from airborne remote sensing or ground-based topographic surveys. These high-resolution models allow for profile metrics calculations at repeated intervals down the length of the site, with an adjustable interval distance. For 2011 CHaMP data, this distance was set to 0.5m.
The output values from these calculations include mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for all profile values, as well as filtered mean, filtered standard deviation, and filtered coefficient of variation for a subset of the profile intervals. The filtering process removes any data points that lie more than a specified number of standard deviations away from the population mean, which helps to eliminate outliers from the dataset. For CHaMP 2011, this threshold was set at 4 standard deviations. This method is designed for analyzing river channel data by providing detailed profile metric calculations and an efficient mechanism for removing outliers.
4. Target: The primary focus of the RBT tool is to provide accurate and customizable methods for analyzing and measuring river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs).
5. Constraints: This method requires DEM data, which can be obtained from airborne remote sensing techniques like LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys. Additionally, the user must define an interval distance for metric calculations and set a filtering threshold to remove outliers from the dataset.
