  "abstract": " Snorkel Herding is a unique snorkeling technique employed to gather fish in confined bodies of water, like pools, within streams (for instance, habitat units as mentioned in Heitke et al. 2009). This method serves the purpose of efficiently collecting fish for various reasons such as research or population management. It sets itself apart from traditional snorkeling by its focused approach and the use of specific tools or techniques to herd fish into designated areas, making it easier to capture them without causing significant disruption to their habitat or surrounding ecosystem."

  "description": " Snorkel Herding is an innovative snorkeling technique employed primarily for fish capture in confined aquatic environments, such as pools or habitat units (Heitke et al., 2009). This approach modifies traditional snorkeling practices to facilitate effective fish collection.\n\nThe method involves using the snorkeler's body as a barrier to herd fish towards specific areas or pools within the stream. By carefully maneuvering through the water, the snorkeler can gently guide the fish in desired directions without causing excessive stress or harm. This targeted approach is particularly effective in situations where conventional fishing methods may be impractical or detrimental to the ecosystem.\n\nDuring the process, the snorkeler wears a mask and uses a snorkel to breathe comfortably underwater while maintaining visual contact with the fish. The herding technique relies on subtle movements and quiet presence, as well as an understanding of fish behavior and habitat preferences. By observing their body language and reaction patterns, the snorkeler can effectively manipulate the fish's movement and direct them towards collection points.\n\nIn summary, Snorkel Herding is a specialized snorkeling technique used for fish capture in confined water environments. It involves herding fish by maneuvering through the water and using subtle movements to guide their behavior while minimizing stress and ensuring a sustainable harvest."

  "constraints": " The text describes \"Snorkel Herding\" as a modified approach to snorkeling used for capturing fish in small areas of a stream. The method is applicable to specific habitats or habitat units, as mentioned by Heitke et al. (2009). This constraint implies that Snorkel Herding is suitable for relatively small bodies of water and may require a higher level of control or manipulation to effectively capture fish compared to traditional snorkeling.\n\nThe constraints are stated in the text body under two conditions:\n1. The method is used specifically for capturing fish in small areas of a stream.\n2. The application of this method is within habitat units, as referenced by Heitke et al. (2009)."
