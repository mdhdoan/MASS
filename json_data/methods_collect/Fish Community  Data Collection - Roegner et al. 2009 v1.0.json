  "abstractText": "The incentive for many restoration activities in the Columbia River Estuary (CRE) is to increase habitat available for rearing and migrating juvenile salmonid ESUs listed as threatened or endangered under ESA. One measure of success in effectiveness evaluations is a demonstration of increased habitat use by salmonids at restored locations relative to reference habitat. The minimum protocols for fish monitoring include abundance and size measurements of species at each site. From these basic data, species composition and size-frequency histograms can be produced. However, we advocate higher order measurements for quantitative assessment of habitat utilization by different salmon stocks and life history types, which require analysis of, for instance, genetics, marks and tags, and prey availability and consumption (see Additional Measurements subsection, below). Ultimately, relation of fish habitat use to physical conditions such as water quality (Protocol 1 (Method ID: 814/815), hydrology, and Protocol 2 (Method ID: 816/817), water quality) will be important for evaluating and predicting restoration success in the CRE.",
