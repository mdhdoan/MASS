 Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize and analyze the text you provided. Here are the keywords I identified as being most relevant to the method described:

1. Particle measurement
2. Transects
3. Fast-water turbulent and non-turbulent channel units
4. Particle embeddedness
5. CHaMP - Particle Size Distribution and Particle Embeddedness Method

Now, let's move on to the rest of your request:

2. Abstract:
The method described in this text involves measuring particles within a site's fast-water turbulent and non-turbulent channel units. A total of 210 particles were measured at 10 transects, with a focus on particles between 65 and 250mm in size. The CHaMP - Particle Size Distribution and Particle Embeddedness Method was used to estimate particle embeddedness, which is calculated as the product of the percentage of the cobbles surface that is buried below the surface of the streambed and the percentage of fine sediment < 2 mm in the substrate immediately surrounding the cobble. This method provides a way to analyze particle distribution and embeddedness within a site's channel units, which can be useful for studying streambed stability and sediment transport.
3. Description:
The text describes a method for measuring particles within fast-water turbulent and non-turbulent channel units. A total of 210 particles were measured at 10 transects, with a focus on particles between 65 and 250mm in size. The CHaMP - Particle Size Distribution and Particle Embeddedness Method was used to estimate particle embeddedness, which is calculated as the product of the percentage of the cobbles surface that is buried below the surface of the streambed and the percentage of fine sediment < 2 mm in the substrate immediately surrounding the cobble. This method allows researchers to analyze particle distribution and embeddedness within a site's channel units, which can provide insight into streambed stability and sediment transport. The text provides background on the CHaMP method and emphasizes the importance of proper measurement techniques for accurate data collection.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to analyze particle distribution and embeddedness within a site's channel units, with a specific focus on particles between 65 and 250mm in size.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is the need for proper measurement techniques to ensure accurate data collection. Additionally, the method may be limited by the availability of resources, such as time and funding, to conduct particle measurements at multiple transects within a site. Furthermore, the method's applicability may be limited to sites with fast-water turbulent and non-turbulent channel units, which may not be representative of all stream systems.
