  "abstractText": "Measuring the weight of individuals from specific species (typically a variety of game or commercial fishes that can be found throughout the system) can be useful for characterizing size structure within populations by developing length x weight relationships (Ickes et al. 2014).The relationship between length and weight of a fish species in a river system is useful for providing a practical index of the condition of the fish and to potentially compare life-history strategies between different river systems (Petrakis and Stergiou 1995, Kirby and Ickes 2006).",
