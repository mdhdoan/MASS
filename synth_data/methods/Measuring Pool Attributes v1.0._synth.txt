2. Abstract: This method focuses on measuring specific attributes of a pool before and after a project to detect significant changes. By analyzing the percentage of fines and embeddedness within the impact and control areas, one can determine whether the project has caused any substantial alterations. This approach provides a systematic way to evaluate the effects of a project on a pool's condition.
3. Description: The text describes a method for assessing changes in a pool environment as a result of a project. Two key metrics are used in this analysis: the percentage of fines and the level of embeddedness within the impact and control areas. Changes in these metrics before and after the project can help identify any significant variations in the pool's condition. This methodology offers a structured means to evaluate the impact of projects on pool attributes and provide valuable insights for future decision-making.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to assess changes in pool attributes resulting from a specific project.
5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method include the accuracy and reliability of pool attribute measurements, the selection of appropriate impact and control areas, and the potential influence of external factors on pool conditions that may affect the interpretation of results.
