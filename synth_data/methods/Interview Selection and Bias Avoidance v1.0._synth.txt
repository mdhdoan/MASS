2. Abstract: This method outlines a structured approach to gathering data from charter and private boats through interviews, aiming to represent the fleet activity for target species accurately. Charter boat effort is stratified by trip type before the interview, while private boats are selected randomly to mitigate sampling bias towards specific trip types. The process captures both fishing and non-fishing trips, ensuring a comprehensive view of the boating activities.
3. Description: This method employs two distinct strategies for charter and private boat interviews due to differences between them. Charter boats are stratified based on trip type before the interview to ensure representative coverage of various target species. Private boats, however, cannot be pre-stratified; therefore, random sampling is applied within the boat basin and launch ramp area to avoid bias towards specific trip types. Interviewers follow guidelines to approach private boats without prejudice regarding size, number of anglers, or presence/absence of fish, fishing tackle, etc. They are to interview the next returning boat and continue this process for all boats completing their trips. This method sets sampling schedules in advance to guarantee representative coverage for different hours and seasons. Interviews begin at the boat upon its return to the dock or ramp, capturing all anglers and catch from the trip.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to develop a structured interviewing process for charter and private boats that provides a reliable representation of fleet activity and target species.
5. Constraints: This method's constraints include potential difficulties in obtaining equal representation across various private boat trip types due to random sampling, as well as the challenge of allocating adequate resources (interviewers, time) to ensure coverage for all day and season types, particularly when dealing with large fishing fleets.
