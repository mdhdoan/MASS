2. Abstract: The application of PIT tags has grown significantly over the years, and its recovery program is a natural extension of the current CWT recovery program. This project aims to expand Washington's LCR CWT program to include a recovery program for all tags, including PIT tags, and provide point and interval estimates for recovered PIT and CWT tags by stratum when sample sizes are sufficient. The project will leverage the existing framework and infrastructure of the current CWT recovery program along with other state, federal, and locally funded fisheries and escapement sampling programs coordinated by the WDFW.

3. Description: The use of PIT tags has increased from 20,000 in 1988 to over 2,000,000 in 2009, with 2% of returning adult salmon and steelhead passing Bonneville Dam (BON) being PIT tagged. The project's goal is to expand Washington's LCR CWT program to include a recovery program for all tags, including PIT tags, and marks sampled in fisheries and escapement programs. The project aims to provide point and interval estimates for recovered PIT and CWT tags by stratum when sample sizes are sufficient and make this information available to policy makers, planners, managers, and others. This project builds on the existing framework and infrastructure of the current CWT recovery program along with other state, federal, and locally funded fisheries and escapement sampling programs coordinated by the WDFW.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to expand Washington's LCR CWT program to include a recovery program for all tags, including PIT tags, and provide point and interval estimates for recovered PIT and CWT tags by stratum when sample sizes are sufficient.

5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need for sufficient sample sizes to provide accurate point and interval estimates for recovered PIT and CWT tags by stratum. Additionally, the project relies on the existing framework and infrastructure of the current CWT recovery program along with other state, federal, and locally funded fisheries and escapement sampling programs coordinated by the WDFW.
