  "abstractText": "Bed and bank materials of a stream are key elements in the formation and maintenance of channel morphology. These materials influence channel stability and resistance to scour during high flow events. The frequency of bed load transport can be critically important to fish spawning and other aquatic organisms that use the substrate for cover. The pebble count procedure was originally designed to quantify streambed substrate without having to collect substrate samples and take them back to the lab for sieve analysis. The procedure requires taking measurements of substrate at increments along main channel and side channels transects within bankfull constraints.",
