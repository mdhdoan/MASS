  "abstractText": "Electrofishing: Obtain collectors permits and ESA clearances. Once the settings on the electrofisher have been set properly, begin sampling the reach and fish in an upstream direction. Sample available cut-bank and snag habitat. Sample deep, shallow, fast, slow, complex, and simple habitats. Continue upstream until the next Transect is reached. Process fish and change water after each Transect to reduce mortality and track sampling effort.  Snorkeling: Measure the water temperature. Estimate visibility as low, medium, or high. Begin at the downstream boundary of the control reach and proceed upstream. A two person snorkeling crew can conduct snorkel surveys in wadeable stream control and impact study reaches. In areas where the stream is not wadeable, up to four snorkelers may be needed. In non-wadeable areas, crew members should snorkel side by side and sum their individual counts. Each snorkeler counts the fish to the immediate front and to the sides opposite the other snorkeler or as designated by the team leader to avoid duplication of counts. All species of fish observed from one Transect to the next (A to B, B to C, etc.) should be enumerated, identified, and recorded (Fish Survey Form, Figure 9). Forklengths should be estimated to the nearest 5 mm. Continue proceeding upstream until the survey is completed at Transect K. Forklengths should be estimated to the nearest 5 mm. After snorkeling, rate underwater visibility of each study",
