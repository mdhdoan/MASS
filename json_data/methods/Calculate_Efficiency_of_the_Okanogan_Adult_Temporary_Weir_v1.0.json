  "abstractText": "The primary objective for weir operationsis to utilize it as an adult Summer/Fall Chinook Salmon management tool, to meetbroodstockneeds of the hatchery program, and to meet the proportion of hatchery-originspawners(pHOS)and the proportion ofnatural influence (PNI) targets for the population.The fate of fish captured in the weir trap consists of the following:1. Hatchery-origin Chinook will be; (a) retained to reduce escapement of hatchery fish and reducepHOSand increasePNIto achieve population goals(b) retained for use in Chief Joseph Hatchery segregated programbroodstockif needed; or (c) released upstream of the weir for continued migration to the spawning grounds if overall run size is relatively low (<5,000) andpHOSis also low (<20%).2. Natural-origin Chinook will be; (a) released upstream of the weir for continued migration to the spawning grounds; or (b) retained for use in Chief Joseph Hatchery integrated programbroodstock.Weir efficiency is a measure of the proportion of total spawning escapement encountered by the weir. After spawning ground surveys are completed, all ofthe weirtrapping and estimated Okanogan spawning escapement informationis gathered to calculate the weir efficiency",
