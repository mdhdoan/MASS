2. Abstract: The USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center Bird Count Database is a collaborative effort to provide a searchable and manageable platform for standardized bird surveys. This database allows researchers and organizations to upload raw point count data, which is then summarized internally and reported out as an Access database table. The point count method is a standardized approach to conducting bird surveys, enabling comparisons of bird numbers across sites and years.
3. Description: The USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center Bird Count Database is a searchable repository that serves multiple purposes: it functions as a tool for managing surveys, a place for collaboration among organizations like Partners in Flight or regional surveys, and the official site for National Wildlife Refuge point counts. Point counts are a method for conducting standardized bird surveys, which involve collecting raw data at specific points and comparing numbers of birds among sites or years. The database was built through collaboration among USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, the USFWS National Wildlife Refuge System, American Bird Conservancy, and many individuals. Raw point count data is uploaded into the database, which then summarizes the data internally and reports it out in a structured format (Access database table).
4. Target: The primary goal of the bird count database is to provide a standardized, collaborative platform for managing and comparing bird survey data using the point count method.
5. Constraints: While the bird count database offers a powerful tool for managing and comparing bird survey data, its utility may be limited by the availability and quality of raw point count data provided by researchers and organizations. Additionally, the database's effectiveness may be influenced by the accuracy and consistency of data collection methods used in the field.
