 1. Abstract: The text describes a research project aimed at determining the status and trends of juvenile steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations in the Okanogan basin, a tributary of the Upper Columbia River. Researchers use a combination of methods, including electrofishing, PIT tagging, mark-recapture events, and in-stream PIT tag antennas to assess utilization of tributaries by juvenile steelhead, estimate population sizes and emigration rates, and conform to existing monitoring frameworks in the basin.
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes: The value of this research lies in its contribution to the recovery efforts for threatened steelhead populations in the Upper Columbia basin, as outlined in the Monitoring Strategy for the Upper Columbia Basin (Hillman 2006). The problem statement is that estimating the population size of naturally produced juvenile steelhead in the Okanogan basin is a challenging task due to variations in life history strategies and residence times. The desired outcome is to obtain independent, stream-based population emigration estimates from PIT tags and determine an estimate of abundance of juvenile O. mykiss in small streams.
3. Description: The research uses several methods to achieve its objectives, including electrofishing to sample fish populations, remote PIT tagging to track individual fish movement, mark-recapture events to estimate population sizes, and in-stream PIT tag antennas to detect emigrating juvenile steelhead. The study is designed to conform to existing monitoring frameworks in the basin and follows Protocol #7 - OBMEP - Juvenile Abundance - Snorkel Surveys for estimating juvenile abundance.
4. Objectives: The objective of this research is to determine the status and trends of juvenile steelhead populations in the Okanogan basin, calculate an independent, stream-based population emigration estimate from PIT tags, and determine an estimate of abundance of juvenile O. mykiss in small streams. This objective covers all aspects of the problem statement.

5. Target: The primary focus of this protocol is to assess utilization of tributaries by juvenile steelhead and estimate population sizes and emigration rates in the Okanogan basin.
6. Constraints: The main constraints for this protocol include variations in life history strategies and residence times of juvenile steelhead, which can make interpreting migrational movements challenging, as well as ensuring that marked fish are representative of unmarked fish, marks are retained and all marks are detected upon recapture, marking of fish does not affect the likelihood of recapture, marked fish are randomly distributed with unmarked fish, an equal effort is used in both fish capture passes, fish can be identified correctly, observed numbers of fish accurately represent total population within the reach, and each study site is representative of the reach in which it is located and that fish are evenly distributed throughout the reach.
