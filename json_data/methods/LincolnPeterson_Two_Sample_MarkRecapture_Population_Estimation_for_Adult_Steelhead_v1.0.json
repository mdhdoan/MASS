  "abstractText": "Steelhead offer a unique life history type that allows adult population estimation through capture and recapture at the same site during their spawning migration. Because steelhead do not always die after spawning like other pacific salmon, we can capture and recapture fish on their upstream and downstream spawning migrations respectively. In this case we used a weir-trap (Method ID: 145) located near the mouth of a creek to capture upstream migrating steelhead, and a kelt (post-spawn steelhead) trap (Method ID: 5450) as our recapture collection point located in close proximity to the upstream capture point. Population estimates and post spawn survival estimates could then be derived for each creek.",
