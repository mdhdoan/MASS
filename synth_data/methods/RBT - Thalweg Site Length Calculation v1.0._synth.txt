2. Abstract: The River Bathymetry Toolkit (RBT) is a suite of Geographic Information System (GIS) tools designed to work within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software. It allows users to analyze river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). These DEMs can be generated from airborne remote sensing techniques such as LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys. The RBT provides a range of features including detrending the DEM, cutting user-defined cross sections, defining hydraulic geometry, computing stream gradient and sinuosity, mapping longitudinal variations in channel geometry metrics, varying water levels to investigate water depth distribution, and identifying residual pools which can be used to identify fish habitats.
3. Description: The RBT is an ArcGIS extension, requiring the ESRI ArcGIS software to function. It utilizes DEMs derived from airborne or ground-based surveys to analyze river channels. The detrending feature removes the longitudinal valley slope for accurate analysis. Users can define cross sections and hydraulic geometry parameters such as bankfull width/depth. The toolkit also computes stream gradient, sinuosity, and maps longitudinal variations in channel geometry metrics. It further allows users to vary water levels in a detrended DEM to investigate water depth distribution and off-channel habitats connected to the main stem flow. A significant feature is the ability to locate residual pools which can aid in identifying fish habitats.
4. Target: The primary goal of the RBT is to provide a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing river channels using high-resolution DEMs within the ESRI ArcGIS environment.
5. Constraints: The River Bathymetry Toolkit is an ArcGIS extension, hence it requires the ESRI ArcGIS software to function. The quality and resolution of the DEM data used can significantly impact the accuracy of the analysis.
