  "background": "The Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) provides habitat to a wide array of fish and wildlife species distributed among a complex assortment of flowing channels, floodplain lakes, backwaters, wetlands, and floodplain forests. In ecosystems as diverse and complex as the UMRS, many processes and their interrelationships are not well known. Long-term monitoring is perhaps most effective meansand in some cases, the only meansby which large, complex ecosystems such as the UMRS can be studied and managed.As Long Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP) databases have matured in scope and accumulated more years worth of data, their utility in research and management in the UMRS basin has increased notably.Today, the LTRMPs data assets represent one of the worlds largest and most extensive datasets on a great river.Fishes were chosen as a key ecological component to be monitored by the long term monitoring program of the Upper Mississippi River because of their economic importance to the region, conservation potential, and their utility for assessing the ecological integrity of the UMRS aquatic ecosystem (Jackson et al. 1981, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1992).Fisheries data, thus collected, are used to quantify the status and trends of fish populations and communities (U.S. Geological Survey 1999; Johnson and Hagerty 2008), fisheries data are used to identify relations with various other ecological attributes (Barko and Herzog 2003; Barko et al. 2004; Koel 2004; Barko et al. 2005; Chick et al. 2005; Ickes et al. 2005; Barko et al. 2006; Kirby and Ickes 2006; Irons et al. 2007; Knights et al. 2008; Irons et al. 2009; Garvey et al. 2010; Dukerschein et al. 2011; McCain et al. 2011), and fisheries data are used to address fisheries management concerns in a multiuse, large river resource (U.S. Geological Survey 1999).Herein, information is presentedon the most current procedures and the rationale for monitoring nearly one-fifth of the entire North American freshwater fish fauna (representing the greatest freshwater fish diversity on the planet at temperate latitudes).The strategies employed for data collection and site selection as well asthe uses forLTRMP data are also included.",

  "assumptions": "<p>At the &ldquo;systemic&rdquo; UMRS scale, representing the LTRMP&rsquo;s legislative domain (all navigable reaches of the UMRS), each of the study reaches is representative of proximate navigation pools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because over the past 20 years the LTRMP has observed 144 fish species and many additional hybrids. The LTRMP has gained requisite information to achieve absolute abundance or density estimates across all design elements, time, sampling methods, and species. The LTRMP fisheries component makes the necessary simplifying assumption that indexed abundance reflects changes in true abundance over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
