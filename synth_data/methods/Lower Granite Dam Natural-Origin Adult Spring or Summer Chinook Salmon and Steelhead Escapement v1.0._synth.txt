5. Natural-origin adult escapement

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
The method described in this text aims to estimate the unknown number of wild steelhead and Chinook that cross Lower Granite dam each day. This is a complicated task due to various factors such as window counts not being conducted at night, potential for individual fish to be counted multiple times or lost downstream, lack of estimation potential for fish passing through locks, and the presence of non-externally-marked hatchery-origin fish. The method utilizes information from previously tagged fish, window counts, trap rate, and hatchery/natural information from the trap to arrive at a more accurate estimate of total natural-origin adult escapement.
3. Description:
The text explains that estimating natural-origin adult spring/summer Chinook salmon and steelhead escapement at Lower Granite Dam is complicated by several factors, including window counts not being conducted at night, potential for individuals to be counted multiple times or lost downstream, lack of estimation potential for fish passing through locks, a trap rate that estimates capture probability as a function of the time that the trap is open, potential movement up and downstream through the ladder below the trap, and non-externally-marked hatchery-origin fish. The method jointly utilizes information from previously tagged fish, window counts, trap rate, and hatchery/natural information from the trap to estimate total natural-origin adult escapement.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the method is to estimate the unknown number of wild steelhead and Chinook that cross Lower Granite dam each day.
5. Constraints:
Some constraints for the current method include the need for window counts to be expanded to account for break periods, potential for individuals to be counted multiple times or lost downstream, lack of estimation potential for fish passing through locks, and the presence of non-externally-marked hatchery-origin fish. Additionally, there is a trap rate that estimates capture probability as a function of the time that the trap is open, and potential movement up and downstream through the ladder below the trap.
