2. Abstract: The method described here is a means of identifying bankfull width, which is critical for determining the size and shape of a river channel. This is important for flood management, habitat conservation, and infrastructure planning. By observing certain characteristics such as slope breaks, moss growth, and vegetation types, one can accurately estimate the bankfull width of a channel.
3. Description: The text outlines several key indicators of bankfull width. First, there is often a clear slope break between the channel and the floodplain. This is because bankfull flows are large enough to erode the stream bottom and banks, but frequent enough to prevent substantial growth of upland terrestrial vegetation. As a result, these flows have determined the width and depth of many channels. Second, there is typically a transition from exposed stream sediments to terrestrial vegetation at the bankfull level. This may be marked by moss growth on rocks along the banks. Third, drift material caught on overhanging vegetation can indicate the height of bankfull flows. Finally, there is usually a shift in vegetation types from flood and scour tolerant species near the channel to those that are relatively intolerant of these conditions further away.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a practical and observable means for determining bankfull width.
5. Constraints: This method requires visual access to the river channel and its surrounding areas. It may not be applicable in situations where vegetation or other features obscure these views. Additionally, it assumes that bankfull flows have been frequent enough in the past to leave a clear signature on the landscape.
