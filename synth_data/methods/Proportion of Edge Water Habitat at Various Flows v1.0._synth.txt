Now, let's move on to the rest of your request:

2. Abstract:
Edge habitat is crucial for the rearing of juvenile salmonids as it provides refuge from high velocities and depths found in the main channels of large rivers. Quantifying available edge habitat is essential for monitoring changes related to restoration actions, which requires the calculation of water depths and velocities through hydraulic modeling. This method enables restoration projects to effectively increase edge habitat, thereby improving the overall health of salmonid populations.
3. Description:
The text describes the importance of edge habitat for juvenile salmonid rearing in large rivers. It explains how this type of habitat provides refuge from higher velocities and depths found in the main channel. The necessity of quantifying available edge habitat is discussed, as it allows changes in edge habitat to be monitored with regards to restoration actions. The method for calculating water depths and velocities required for edge habitat quantification is hydraulic modeling, which involves using a separate data analysis method.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to enable the calculation of available edge habitat through hydraulic modeling, allowing for effective monitoring and improvement of salmonid rearing habitats in large rivers.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is the need for specialized knowledge and tools to perform hydraulic modeling. Additionally, obtaining accurate data on water depths and velocities can be challenging, which may impact the accuracy of edge habitat quantification. Finally, restoration projects aiming to increase edge habitat must consider potential trade-offs with other riverine habitats and ecosystem services.
