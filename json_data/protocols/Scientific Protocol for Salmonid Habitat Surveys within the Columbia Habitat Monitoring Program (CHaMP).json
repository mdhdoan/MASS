  "background": "CHaMP is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&E Workgroup 2010). This version 4 was developed in 2014 to reflect refinements in methodology.CHaMP will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring anadromous salmonids and/or their habitat. The implementation of CHaMP will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, fish-in and fish-out monitoring (identified in RPA 50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of RPA 56.3, RPA 57, and RPA 3. CHaMP was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel (see section 1.6), at least 9 years.",

  "id": 2020,
  "assumptions": "<p>The protocol is structured around a general understanding of the link between habitat attributes and how they directly relate to the specific life history requirements of the salmonid fishes managed under the 2008 BiOp. These fish are likely not only responding to watershed and reach conditions but also to the conditions of individual channel units within reaches. Recognizing the importance of how interactions at the channel unit scale affect fish performance has led to an increased emphasis on the quantification of this important scale of fish habitat in the CHaMP protocol. We adopted the Hawkins et al. (1993) hierarchical classification scheme that allows for summarization of information across multiple scales. This preserves the ability to summarize information at the site scale as commonly practiced in major fish habitat monitoring programs throughout the Pacific Northwest as well as at the smaller channel-unit and topographical feature scales. The protocol employs spatially continuous sampling strategies using well-established surveying techniques to conduct precise topographic surveys from which digital elevation models (DEMs) can be produced. These topographic surveys are augmented by auxiliary data (e.g., channel classification, fish cover, substrate composition, distribution and embeddedness, large woody debris (LWD), solar input and water temperature, stream discharge, water chemistry, riparian structure, and site-level human influence) that help to characterize aspects of channel units that influence site-scale fish production potential. The CHaMP protocol draws together methods from many existing protocols as well as novel approaches to collecting and analyzing channel geomorphological data. The protocol is designed to collect data that fits within a geomorphological hierarchy spanning spatial scales ranging from within-unit topographical features to channel units to geomorphic to watershed and subbasin scales.</p>\r\n",
  "objectives": [
    "The stream habitat data will be applied in conjunction with salmonid growth, survival, abundance and productivity data to estimate fish-habitat relationships across the Upper Columbia River Basin area",
    "To generate standardized status and trend and effectiveness monitoring data for salmonid habitat in important Major Population Groups and spaitally diverse watersheds of the Columbia River Basin area.",
    "To assess the quantity and quality of stream habitat for salmonids in wadeable, perennial streams below natural impassible barriers within Technical Recovery Team population boundaries across the UCRB"
