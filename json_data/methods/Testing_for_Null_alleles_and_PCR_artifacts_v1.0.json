  "abstractText": "Genotyping errors may occur when primer-site mutations result in non-amplified alleles (null alleles), or due to PCR artifacts that cause large allele drop-out (large alleles do not amplify as efficiently as small alleles) and allele stuttering (PCR slippage). Such errors can cause deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibria, and may bias spatial and temporal population genetic analyses.",
