2. Abstract: Wetland accretion in the Pacific Northwest is an essential process linked to inundation by sediment-laden (turbid) water. To measure this, a method combining the deployment of turbidity and pressure sensors on a wetland platform along with Surface Elevation Table (SET) data is proposed. This approach offers valuable information about sediment supply and delivery, addressing the need for better understanding of wetland accretion processes and their environmental implications.
3. Description: The text describes a method aimed at studying wetland accretion in the Pacific Northwest, which has been linked to inundation by sediment-laden (turbid) water. To measure this process, turbidity and pressure sensors are deployed on a wetland platform. These sensors help quantify inundation and turbidity levels, providing insights into sediment supply and delivery. By co-locating these measurements with Surface Elevation Table (SET) data, which measures long-term accretion, researchers can gather comprehensive information about the process. This method addresses the need for better understanding of wetland accretion processes and their environmental implications.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide valuable insights into sediment supply and delivery in wetland accretion processes in the Pacific Northwest.
5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method could include accessibility to the wetland area, sensor reliability and maintenance, availability and accuracy of SET data, and potential interference from environmental factors affecting turbidity and pressure measurements.
