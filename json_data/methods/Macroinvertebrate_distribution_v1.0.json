  "abstractText": "Describing the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrates can take many forms depending on study objectives and the spatial scale under consideration. This method describes a simple, general approach that should be customized based on a study's objectives and level of complexity of the analysis. It is assumed that samples are collected at multiple locations over large spatial area so that inferences can be made about the distribution on macroinvertebrates within that area.",
