  "abstractText": "We used a combination of weir-trapping (Method ID:145)and video observations (Method ID: 5448) and PIT tag detections (Method ID: 3919) to determine the abundance ofsalmonid in a creek. Returning adults were trapped adjacent to a resistance-panel weir that was operated in the creek. In an attempt to increase overall trapping efficiency while reducing weir effects (such as delay of timing of migration to the spawning grounds), two modifications were made to the weir. First, a lighted, video-monitored bypass chute (Anderson et al. 2006) was installed adjacent to the resistance-panel weir bulkhead on the side of the weir opposite from the trap live-box; and second, we modified the entrance to the trap live-box to an adjustable-height finger weir design.",
