All sites were assigned to an &#39;annual&#39; panel to provide flexibility in sampling around restoration implementation. &nbsp;Sampling ideally follows the before and 1,3, 5&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The effectiveness monitoring design for the habitat enhancement areas were paired with a status and trend monitoring design covering the rest of the Mountain Creek watershed. A separate sampling design describes this sampling approach. &nbsp;Both effectiveness and status and trend monitoring designs for Mountain Creek were designed to work in tandem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
