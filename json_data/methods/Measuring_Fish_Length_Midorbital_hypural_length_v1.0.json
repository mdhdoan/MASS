  "abstractText": "Measurements of specific parts of a fish are sometimes necessary when intact fish are not available. For instance, spawning or dead salmon often have eroded tails (from redd excavation) or enlarged or damaged jaws.  When researchers want to compare fish lengths of male spawners versus female spawners or hatchery spawned females versus carcasses, it is a good idea to use this type of length measurement to remove the bias of the eroded tails on female spawners.  So length measurements are made from specific parts of the body that are intact, such as the orbit and the hypural plate. The hypural plate is comprised of modified vertebrae that support the rays of the caudal fin and originate from the posterior end of the vertebral column (Figure 1). This measurement is also commonly referred to as MEPS, or mid-eye to posterior scale (Figure 3), noting that researchers typically take the measurement to an external feature (as noted in the step by step instructions) when the hypural plate is not visible.",
