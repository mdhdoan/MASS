  "abstract": " This text describes a method used to study the passage performance and behavior of Pacific Lamprey at mainstem and tributary barriers. Anadromous fishes like Pacific Lamprey have complex life cycles, making them susceptible to environmental and human impacts throughout their lives. The data gathered from this research is crucial for understanding how these fish are affected by different environments and for managing populations effectively.\n\nTo study Pacific Lamprey, researchers use a technology called Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags. These small, non-invasive devices have no battery but rely on power from the antenna array to activate when detected. They are inexpensive, quick to apply, and have a long lifespan since they don't require a battery. Each tag has a unique ID number which allows researchers to identify individual fish whenever they are detected.\n\nResearchers place fixed-site PIT arrays at strategic locations in the fishways to detect tagged Pacific Lamprey as they pass. Data from these detections is used to evaluate passage success, duration, and timing of fish movements at mainstem and tributary barriers. This information helps assess the performance of the original fishway designs and any subsequent modifications, ensuring that the needs of Pacific Lamprey are considered alongside those of salmonids, which have historically been prioritized.\n\nMoreover, radio PIT technology is used by CRITFC Member Tribes to gather data on returning adult Pacific Lamprey. This information allows for comparisons of passage performance at mainstem and tributary barriers. Data from these studies is essential for determining abundance, survival, life history characteristics, and restoration effectiveness. Effective population management relies on understanding population status and trends, which can be assessed using data collected through this method.\n\nIn summary, the use of PIT tags and monitoring at mainstem and tributary barriers is crucial for understanding Pacific Lamprey behavior, distribution patterns, and final fates within their river environments. This information is necessary to evaluate passage performance, manage populations effectively, and assess the success of restoration actions."

  "description": " This text focuses on the evaluation of Pacific Lamprey (Petromyzontidae) passage performance at mainstem and tributary barriers, as well as examining their behavior and distribution patterns within these environments. Anadromous fishes, including Pacific Lamprey, exhibit complex life cycles that make them vulnerable to environmental and anthropogenic change. They utilize various freshwater and marine habitats during different stages of their lives.\n\nPacific Lamprey use freshwater benthic areas as larvae, migrate as juveniles through freshwater streams and rivers, reside in the ocean as parasitic adults, and then move back to freshwater for spawning. Human activities can impact these fish at each life history stage.\n\nTo evaluate passage efficiency of Pacific Lamprey at mainstem and tributary barriers, Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) telemetry is employed. PIT data is used to assess structural and operational modifications made to enhance adult Pacific Lamprey passage success in fishways. Strategically placed fixed-site PIT arrays detect tagged fish passing at specific areas of interest in the fishways. Detections provide information on passage success, duration, and timing.\n\nHistorically, fishway designs have prioritized maximizing salmonid passage efficiencies, which may not benefit non-salmonid species like Pacific Lamprey. PIT tags are useful for various monitoring purposes such as determining migration timing, tracking fish through fish ladders, and assisting in mark-recapture studies.\n\nPacific Lamprey are tagged using radio PIT technology by CRITFC Member Tribes to gather information on returning anadromous adults. This data is employed for comparative analysis of adult Pacific Lamprey passage performance at mainstem and tributary barriers, with a focus on adult distribution patterns (upstream and downstream of barriers). The data is utilized for determination of abundance, survival, life history characteristics, restoration effectiveness, status, and trends evaluations.\n\nPopulation monitoring of natural and hatchery-origin fish using PIT tag information supports effective population management, assesses the effectiveness of restoration actions, evaluates viability, and monitors recovery metrics."
