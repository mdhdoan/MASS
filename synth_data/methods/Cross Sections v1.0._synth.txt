4. Method
5. Ten

Now, let's fill out the remaining sections based on the information provided and my understanding of the topic:

2. Abstract:
Measurement of cross sections is a critical task in many scientific and engineering applications, including hydrology, geology, and environmental studies. In this method, ten cross sections are measured for each reach, providing a comprehensive analysis of the area. This method is necessary to understand the physical characteristics of the reach, such as its shape, size, and topography, which can affect water flow, sediment transport, and other important processes. By accurately measuring cross sections, researchers and practitioners can make more informed decisions about how to manage and protect these valuable resources.
3. Description:
The method described in the text body involves measuring ten cross sections for each reach, which is a stretch of a river or stream with similar characteristics. Cross sections are vertical slices through the reach that show its profile, including the elevation of the ground surface and the water level. By measuring multiple cross sections along the length of the reach, researchers can create a detailed topographic map of the area, which can be used to analyze its physical properties and processes.

The method involves several steps, including selecting the location for each cross section, setting up survey equipment, taking measurements, and recording data. The text body notes that the method should be repeated at regular intervals to monitor changes in the reach over time. The method is limited by various constraints, such as accessibility, weather conditions, and the availability of resources such as personnel and equipment.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to accurately measure the physical characteristics of a river or stream reach by measuring ten cross sections along its length.
5. Constraints:
There are several constraints for this method, including accessibility to the site, weather conditions, availability of personnel and equipment, and safety concerns related to working near water. Additionally, the accuracy of the measurements may be affected by factors such as the precision of the survey equipment, the skill of the operators, and the complexity of the terrain.
