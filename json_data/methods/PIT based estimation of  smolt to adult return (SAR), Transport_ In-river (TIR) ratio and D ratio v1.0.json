The tags in juvenile fish which were PIT tagged in upstream tributariesare potentially read as the fish pass through the coils of detectors installed in the collection/bypass channels of mainstem dams. The method randomly pre-assigns the tagged fish to transported and in-riverstudy groups prior to their emigration through the hydrosystem.",
