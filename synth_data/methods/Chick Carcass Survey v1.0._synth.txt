2. Abstract: The post-season chick carcass survey method is crucial for monitoring the health and productivity of Caspian tern and double-crested cormorant colonies. This process involves locating and counting dead chicks, recovering bands from marked individuals, and using this data to estimate nesting success and bird demography/dispersal patterns. The information gathered provides valuable insights into the colony's well-being and helps in long-term conservation efforts.
3. Description: Post-season chick carcass surveys are conducted following the breeding season for Caspian terns and double-crested cormorants. The primary objective is to collect data on dead chicks for estimating nesting success (productivity) of the colony. Additionally, band recovery from marked individuals provides information on demography and dispersal patterns. These bands can be color, alpha-numeric, or metal types, each providing unique identification for individual birds. This method plays a significant role in understanding population dynamics and facilitating informed conservation strategies.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to estimate nesting success (productivity) and gather demographic data on Caspian terns and double-crested cormorants through post-season chick carcass surveys.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for the post-season chick carcass survey method include accessibility to colony sites, potential disturbance of live birds during the survey, and accurate identification and counting of dead chicks, especially when partially concealed or decomposed. Time and resource allocation are also factors that can impact the effectiveness of this monitoring method.
