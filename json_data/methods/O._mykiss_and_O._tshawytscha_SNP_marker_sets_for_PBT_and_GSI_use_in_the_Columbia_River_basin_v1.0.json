  "abstractText": "Over the last several years, the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission's fish genetics lab in Hagerman, ID has tested hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic markers developed by labs throughout the PNW (Smith et al 2005a, 2005b; Clemento et al 2011) for their possible conservation and management applications in the Columbia River basin.  The CRITFC lab also developed and tested hundreds of additional SNP loci specifically for projects involving Genetic Stock Identification (GSI), Parentage Based Tagging, intraspecific hybridization/introgression, reproductive success, and selection studies (Campbell et al 2008).  Currently, there are 192 SNP markers (two 96 panel sets) for both steelhead and Chinook salmon that have been selected for use by CRITFC and IDFG for BPA projects involving GSI and PBT in the Columbia River basin.  For PBT broodstock tagging in the Snake River basin, one 96 SNP panel for each species has been optimized to provide sufficient power for parentage tagging (Steele et al 2011).  For GSI, both the 96 PBT SNP panel and a second 96 SNP panel are run for GSI projects. Procedures for running SNPs on the Fluidigm EP1 SNP Genotyping platform are described in method 1332.  Primer/probe sequences and assay plate configurations are included in the attachment (Columbia River Basin OMY and OTS SNP sets 2apr12.pdf).",
