  "background": "The Nez Perce Tribe's Department of Fisheries Resources Management utilize dual frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) and underwater video technology as a passive collection tool for salmon abundance and productivity monitoring in the Snake River Basin. Data are utilized for determination of abundance, survival and life history characteristics, hatchery effectiveness and status and trends evaluations. Population status and trend monitoring of natural and hatchery origin fish is used for effective population management, assessing effectiveness of conservation actions, viability, and recovery metric monitoring.Please see protocols #2246 and #2249 for data analysis methods describing the calculation of metrics and indicators.",
