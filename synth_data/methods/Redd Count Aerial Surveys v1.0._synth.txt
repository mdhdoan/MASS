2. Abstract:
Aerial surveys for redd count are an efficient and less labor-intensive method for enumerating fish redds in large or remote river systems. This technique involves the use of a helicopter with a pilot and two surveyors, who fly over spawning areas at specific times to ensure optimal lighting conditions. Observers systematically search for and record all redds within distinct spawning areas, which are then geo-referenced, photographed, and documented on standardized data sheets. Conducting multiple surveys per stream transect on a weekly or bi-weekly basis enhances accuracy and reliability of the counts.

3. Description:
The text describes an advanced method for conducting redd count aerial surveys using helicopters and trained observers to search for and record fish redds in large or remote river systems. Aerial surveys offer several advantages, including increased efficiency and reduced man-hours compared to ground counts. The technique involves flying at specific times of the day to take advantage of optimal lighting conditions for visual identification of redds. During each survey, all redds are systematically enumerated within a distinct spawning area, which is geo-referenced as a group, photographed, and recorded on a standardized data sheet for later analysis. Multiple surveys per stream transect are conducted weekly or bi-weekly to ensure accuracy and reliability of the counts.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to provide an efficient and reliable technique for counting fish redds in large or remote river systems, while minimizing man-hours and maximizing accuracy.

5. Constraints:
Some constraints for this method may include weather conditions (e.g., fog, rain, wind), visibility issues (e.g., water turbidity, vegetation density), aircraft availability, surveyor training, and budget limitations.
