2. Abstract: Hydromodification methods are used to assess the extent and impact of manmade structures on stream channels and their surrounding areas. This is necessary for understanding how these structures affect the natural flow of water and the overall health of the aquatic ecosystem. The method aims to evaluate the level of modification in a stream reach, considering various factors such as bridges, dikes, culverts, roads, and other human activities. By comparing the current state with a reference condition (the natural, undeveloped state), this method provides valuable insights for effective management and restoration of streams.
3. Description: Hydromodifications refer to the alteration of stream channels and their adjacent areas due to manmade structures. These modifications can constrict flow by bridges or restrict access to floodplains due to roads, revetments, diking, or levees. Channel incision/entrenchment associated with headcutting can also lead to significant degradation of the streambed and partially or wholly cut-off flow access to the floodplain. Setback levees are treated differently in this assessment based on their effect on flow and bed dynamics, as well as micro-habitat features along the stream margin.

The reference condition for this attribute is the natural, undeveloped state of a stream reach. Various examples of hydromodifications include dikes, bridges, rip rap, broken concrete, tires, rocks, concrete, wire/fencing, cabling trees, yard waste, dredge spoils, culverts, engineered structures, roads, pipelines, excavation, and other human activities right up to the top of the bank or in the watercourse.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to evaluate the impact of manmade structures on stream channels and their surrounding areas.
5. Constraints: Factors such as limited access to information about historical conditions, insufficient data regarding human activities, and resource constraints can pose challenges when implementing this method.
