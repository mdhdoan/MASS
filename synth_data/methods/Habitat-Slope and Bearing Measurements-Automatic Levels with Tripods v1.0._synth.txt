2. Abstract: This method describes the process of measuring the change in elevation between two points, specifically the top and bottom of a site, using an automatic level, tripod, and stadia rods. The importance of maintaining the stadia rod in a plumb position is emphasized to ensure accurate measurements. The water surface serves as the reference point for all measurements. This method aims to accurately calculate the elevation change and gradient of a site, which can be used to assess factors such as water flow and erosion.
3. Description: The method begins with defining key terms such as "elevation change" and "gradient". It then outlines the necessity of the method and its purpose, which is to accurately measure the change in elevation between two points on a site using an automatic level, tripod, and stadia rods. The user is instructed to position the stadia rod at the bottom of the site (BS), any intermediate spots if necessary, and at the top of the site (TS). The person operating the level will record heights from the stadia rod while the other person positions the stadia rod at the designated points. It is crucial that the stadia rod remains plumb to ensure accurate measurements. The water surface serves as the reference point for all measurements, and elevation changes are recorded on Form 1 and in the data logger. If an error is made during measurement, the user is advised not to enter this data into the logger.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to accurately measure the change in elevation between two points on a site using an automatic level, tripod, and stadia rods, while maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the measurements by keeping the stadia rod plumb and using the water surface as a reference point.
5. Constraints: The method requires the use of specialized equipment such as an automatic level, tripod, and stadia rods. Additionally, it is crucial that the stadia rod remains plumb and that the water surface serves as the reference point for all measurements to ensure accuracy. It is also important to minimize errors during measurement and to not enter incorrect data into the logger.
