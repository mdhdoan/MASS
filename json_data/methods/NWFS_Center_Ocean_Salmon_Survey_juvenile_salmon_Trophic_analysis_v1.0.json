  "abstractText": "These cruises are part of a long-termBonnevillePower Administration-funded effort by academic and federal scientists to understand coastal ecosystems and biological and physical processes that may influence recruitment variability of salmon in Pacific Northwest waters. Presently, research is focused on examining the effects of biotic andabioticenvironmental conditions on the early marine life history of coho and Chinook salmon. This research focused on the Columbia River Plume and its importance for juvenile salmon and highertrophiclevel predators because this is an area of highsalmonidabundance and it is influenced by anthropogenic factors.During early ocean residence, juvenile Chinook and coho salmon and steelhead feed primarily on juvenile fish, adult euphausiids, crab larvae (Peterson et al., 1982, Brodeur & Pearcy, 1990, Daly et al., 2009). As salmon grow older (and larger) during their first summer at sea, they are principally piscivorous which may be an important determinant of juvenile coho and Chinook salmon growth and marine survival (Daly et al., 2013, Trudel et al., 2011). Juvenile steelhead eat more food, higher growth and are in better conditions as they quickly move from estuarine waters to offshore marine waters (Daly et al.in press).",
