2. Abstract: This method discusses the measurement of water conductivity, which serves as a proxy for the concentration of ionized materials in water. By measuring site conductivity at the upstream end of each site and using the CHaMP - Water Chemistry Method, this single measurement becomes the site-level metric for evaluating water quality. This method ensures standardization and ease of comparison across different sites.
3. Description: The text focuses on the concept of water conductivity, which is a measure of the ability of water to conduct electrical current, correlating to the concentration of ionized materials in water. Site conductivity measurements are taken at the upstream end of each site, with the CHaMP - Water Chemistry Method providing guidelines for data collection. This measurement serves as the site-level metric for evaluating water quality. The method emphasizes the importance of this approach for consistent and comparable assessments across different sites.

4. Target: Standardization of water conductivity measurement as a site-level metric for evaluating water quality.
5. Constraints: The primary constraint for this method is ensuring standardized data collection and interpretation across different sites, which may have varying environmental conditions. Adherence to the CHaMP - Water Chemistry Method can help minimize these constraints.
