  "background": "Monitoring and evaluation of adult Snake River sockeye salmon has been an important part of the spread-the-risk philosophy (Hebdon et al. 2004). Prespawn sockeye salmon adults were first released back to the wild in 1993. Adult sockeye salmon raised to maturity in the hatchery and released to valley lakes to spawn provide a natural smolt component that is subject to natural selection. Beginning in 1999, anadromous sockeye salmon have been released into valley lakes (when available) along with adult sockeye salmon that were raised to maturity in a hatchery.Current evaluations of adult sockeye salmon focus on collecting anadromous returning adults (and associated biological metrics such as run timing or average length and weight), assigning those returns back to release strategies for smolt-to-adult survival estimates using Parentage Based Tagging (PBT) genetic analysis, identifying spatial structure of redd produced, and documenting spawn timing from adults released into the lake to volitionally spawn.",
