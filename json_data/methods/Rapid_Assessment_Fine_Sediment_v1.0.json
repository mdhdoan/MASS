  "abstractText": "The assessment of fine sediment in a reach involves estimating the percentage of fine sediment within salmonid spawning substrates. This includes fine sediment located in pool-tailouts, glides, and small cobble-gravel riffles. The effect of fine sediment on egg to fry survival is primarily associated with particle sizes <1mm (e.g., as measured by particles <0.85 mm). Sand size particles (e.g., <6 mm) can be the principal concern when excessive accumulations occur in the upper stratum of the stream bed (Kondolf, 2000). See guidelines on possible benefits accrued due to gravel cleaning by spawning salmonids. Fine sediment is measured in the field to the nearest 5%.",
