2. Abstract: The white-tailed deer cover pole is a method developed to estimate the amount of screening or hiding cover for white-tailed deer in the Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP) model. This tool is crucial for understanding and managing white-tailed deer habitats as it provides an objective and standardized way to assess the availability of cover, which is essential for the survival and reproduction of this species.
3. Description: The white-tailed deer cover pole, as described in Ashley et al. (1998), is a 50-inch tall pole with a diameter of one inch, divided into three equal sections of 16.66 inches each. Alternating between red and white colors, the pole serves as a reference tool for estimating the amount of cover available in a given area. The design and color pattern of the pole allow for accurate measurements of hiding or screening cover, which is an important variable in the HEP model. This model assesses habitat quality based on various factors, such as food, cover, and escape terrain, providing a comprehensive understanding of white-tailed deer habitats.
4. Target: The primary focus of the white-tailed deer cover pole is to serve as a reliable method for estimating hiding or screening cover in white-tailed deer habitats, contributing to better habitat management and population monitoring.
5. Constraints: Limitations for this method include potential variations in vegetation density within each section of the pole and differences in the growth patterns of plants across regions. These factors could affect the accuracy of cover estimates. Moreover, the cover pole may not effectively account for specific microhabitats that offer critical hiding or screening cover for white-tailed deer.
