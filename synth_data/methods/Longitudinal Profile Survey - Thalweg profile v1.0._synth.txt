2. Abstract: The concept of Thalweg refers to the path of deepest flow in a stream channel. A thalweg profile is obtained through a detailed longitudinal survey, providing insights into various aspects such as residual pool volume, stream size, and channel complexity. This method helps in understanding the distribution and proportions of different habitat types like riffles and pools, offering valuable information for environmental studies and water resource management.
3. Description: Thalweg is a term that describes the flow path of the deepest water in a stream channel. The thalweg profile, derived from a longitudinal survey, offers an in-depth understanding of this maximum flow path depth. By analyzing data from the thalweg profile, critical indices can be calculated, including residual pool volume and stream size. Channel complexity is also assessed, providing insights into various aspects such as water velocity, sediment transport, and habitat diversity. Furthermore, the method helps in determining the relative proportions of different habitat types within a stream channel, like riffles (shallow, turbulent areas) and pools (deeper, calm areas).
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to analyze and understand the thalweg characteristics, providing valuable insights into various aspects of stream channels' hydrological and ecological attributes.
5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method might include limited accessibility to certain stream locations, seasonal variations in water levels affecting data collection, or resource limitations impacting the scope and detail of the longitudinal survey.
