 Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here are five relevant keywords related to the method described in the text body:

1. Habitat Suitability curves
2. Spring Chinook and steelhead
3. Data collection (Method 5513, 5514, 5515)
4. Winter habitat requirements
5. Snorkeling procedures (Method 136)

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
This method involves estimating the location of individual or schools of fish within the water column, which serves as input to Habitat Suitability curves for spring Chinook and steelhead. The data collected includes position in the water column, cover, substrate, and focal velocity using Methods 5513, 5514, and 5515. These curves are then used to create Habitat Suitability Indices for spring Chinook and steelhead as part of a study to determine winter habitat requirements for juvenile spring Chinook and steelhead (Protocol 2237). The snorkeling procedures follow those described in Method 136 Basic Snorkel Survey Procedures. This method is necessary to better understand the habitat needs of these fish species to inform conservation efforts.
3. Description:
The text describes a method used to estimate the location of individual or schools of fish within the water column as input to Habitat Suitability curves for spring Chinook and steelhead. Data collected for building Habitat Suitability curves includes position in the water column, cover (Method 5513), substrate (Method 5514), and focal velocity (Method 5515). These curves are then used to create Habitat Suitability Indices for spring Chinook and steelhead as described in Protocol. The data is collected as part of a study to determine winter habitat requirements for juvenile spring Chinook and steelhead (Protocol 2237; <https://www.monitoringresources.org/Document/Protocol/Details/2237>). Snorkeling procedures follow those described in Method 136 Basic Snorkel Survey Procedures.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the method is to determine winter habitat requirements for juvenile spring Chinook and steelhead, using Habitat Suitability curves and indices to inform conservation efforts.
5. Constraints:
One constraint for this method may be accessibility to the water column where the fish are located, as it requires snorkeling or other underwater exploration methods. Additionally, data collection and analysis can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring specialized equipment and expertise.
