2. Abstract: Rotary screw traps (RSTs) are essential tools for managing out-migrating salmon and steelhead populations in their natal streams. By assembling the trap box, pontoons, and helical cone on-site, RSTs can be installed or removed by a small team within a day. Proper safety measures, such as wearing personal flotation devices, safety throw ropes, and waders with felt soles, are crucial when operating around these traps. Regular maintenance and repair ensure the trap's efficiency in capturing fish without causing harm or posing risks to staff members.
3. Description: RSTs consist of a trap box, two pontoons, and a helical cone, which can be assembled at the installation site using bolts. The system becomes operational by lowering the cone into the current with a cable and winch pulley system, or non-operational by raising it out of the water. Installing and removing RSTs requires caution due to cold water temperatures and high flows, as well as careful handling during freezing conditions when ice forms on the trap. Staff members work in pairs, wearing personal flotation devices and safety throw ropes for emergencies. Waders with felt soles provide traction while working around the trap. Regular maintenance and repair are necessary to keep the RST functioning efficiently and safely.
4. Target: The primary goal of RSTs is to manage out-migrating salmon and steelhead populations in their natal streams effectively and safely, ensuring conservation efforts and sustainable fishery practices.
5. Constraints: Operational constraints for RSTs include the need for proper safety measures when working around the traps, especially during periods of cold water, high flows, or freezing temperatures. Installing and removing the anchoring system requires additional time and resources. Additionally, regular maintenance and repair are necessary to maintain the trap's efficiency and ensure safe fish capture without causing harm to the animals or staff members.
