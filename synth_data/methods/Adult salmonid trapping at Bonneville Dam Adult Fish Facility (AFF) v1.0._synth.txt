 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the keywords related to the method described in the text body:

1. Salmonid sampling
2. Bonneville Dam Adult Fish facility
3. PIT tagging
4. Genetics composition
5. Fish Passage Plan

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract:
Since 1985, the Bonneville Dam Adult Fish facility has been conducting salmonid sampling to estimate length, age, and length-at-age composition of adult salmonids. The project has evolved to incorporate PIT tagging and collection of genetics composition. Salmonid sampling at the Adult Fish Facility is regulated by Appendix G of the Fish Passage Plan, which is updated annually. This method provides valuable data for managing and conserving adult salmonid populations in the region.

3. Description:
The text describes a long-term project that involves sampling adult salmonids at the Bonneville Dam Adult Fish facility. The purpose of this sampling is to estimate length, age, and length-at-age composition for adult salmonids. Over time, the project has evolved to include PIT tagging and collection of genetics composition. The sampling is regulated by Appendix G of the Fish Passage Plan, which sets guidelines for how the sampling should be conducted and updated annually.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to collect data on adult salmonid populations in order to manage and conserve them effectively.
5. Constraints:
One constraint for this method is that it must comply with Appendix G of the Fish Passage Plan, which regulates how the sampling is conducted. Additionally, the project requires resources such as personnel, equipment, and funding to carry out the sampling and data analysis.
