 1. Abstract:
The Kootenai River Resident Fish Mitigation Project (KRRFM) is a habitat enhancement initiative aimed at restoring the natural recruitment of white sturgeon in the Kootenai River. Funded by Bonneville Power Administration and managed by Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG), this project involves monitoring the effects of Libby Dam operation and other projects on sturgeon life stages, specifically focusing on spawning substrate additions at Shortys Island and Myrtle Creek. The study will employ telemetry systems, egg mats, and plankton nets to assess female sturgeon use, spawning, hatching success, and egg deposition rates.

2. Values, Statements and Outcomes:
Values: Restoring natural recruitment of Kootenai River white sturgeon; preserving native species populations in the Kootenai River.
Problem Statement: Determining the efficacy of habitat enhancement projects in improving white sturgeon spawning and hatching success rates.
Desired Outcomes: Improved understanding of sturgeon spawning habits, increased hatching success, and successful restoration of natural recruitment of Kootenai River white sturgeon.

3. Description:
The KRRFM Project 1988-065-00 involves assessing the impact of habitat enhancement projects on white sturgeon spawning and hatching in the Kootenai River. IDFG will utilize existing sampling programs, such as Vemco VPS telemetry systems, egg mats, and plankton nets, to monitor sturgeon use of structures, spawning habits, and hatching success rates. The study designs and protocols have been specifically adapted for evaluating habitat structures in this context.

4. Objectives:
Objective: Assess the impact of habitat enhancement projects on white sturgeon spawning substrate selection and hatching success.
Summary of Solution Coverage: This objective addresses both problem statement elements by assessing sturgeon use of structures and evaluating changes in hatching success rates, providing a comprehensive view of the effectiveness of the habitat enhancement projects.
Keywords: Habitat enhancement projects, white sturgeon spawning substrate selection, hatching success rates.

5. Target:
Restoring natural recruitment of Kootenai River white sturgeon through effective habitat enhancement projects.

6. Constraints:
The project's constraints include potential limitations in monitoring equipment and resources for extensive sampling across the entire river scale due to funding restrictions. This may obscure results, making it essential to focus on specific locations for accurate data collection.
