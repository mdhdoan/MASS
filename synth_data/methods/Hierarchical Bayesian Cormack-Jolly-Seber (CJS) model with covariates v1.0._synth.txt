2. Abstract: This study utilizes a hierarchical Bayesian Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model to estimate stage-specific probabilities of apparent survival while accounting for imperfect detection. The method employs a logit-linear regression approach with covariate effects and year-varying intercepts. A Bayesian framework is applied using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, implemented in the Stan platform via the R package rstan. This novel approach provides a robust and accurate estimation of survival probabilities for populations with imperfect detection.
3. Description: The manuscript employs a hierarchical Bayesian CJS model to estimate stage-specific probabilities of apparent survival (f) while accounting for imperfect detection (with probability p). Detection histories y, where yd = 1 if the fish was detected at location d and 0 otherwise, were conditioned on first detection at the initial site. The standard marginal-likelihood formulation of Lebreton et al. (1992) was used to compute the cell probability of each ym, where m=1, ..., M defines a unique combination of detections and covariate values represented by nmtagged individuals. Survival and detection probabilities were modeled as hierarchical logit-linear regressions with covariate effects and year-varying intercepts. The linear predictor of survival from site dt to dt+1 (fmd) includes a 1 Kd vector of covariates xmd whose first entry is 1, with Kd 1 vector of regression coefficients dw whose first element is the intercept 0d, and a normally distributed group-level error td corresponding to the year tin which the observation occurred. The linear predictor for detection probability at site d (pmd) is analogous. The group-level error terms induce a correlation across years in survival through a given reach or detection probability at a given site, but survival and detection are assumed to be independent a priori, as are survival through different reaches and detection at different sites. As usual in CJS models, the detection probability at the initial site p1 is nonidentifiable and the final survival and detection probabilities are identified only as the product fD-1pD. The models were fit in a Bayesian framework using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling (HMC) as implemented in the Stan platform via the R package rstan. All regression coefficients were given diffuse N(0,3) priors except for the intercepts, which had priors that imply a U(0,1) prior on survival or detection when all covariates (in the case of survival) are at their sample means and the group-level error term is zero. Hierarchical standard deviations ds and dswere given half-normal priors with mean zero and SD = 3. The models were run for 1500 draws from the posterior distribution in each of three randomly initiated chains, discarding the first 500 for warmup, giving a total of 3000 saved draws. Convergence was assessed by traceplots, potential scale reduction factor R^hat< 1.05, and absence of any divergent transitions.
4. Target: The primary focus is to develop a robust method for estimating stage-specific probabilities of apparent survival while accounting for imperfect detection in populations with complex life cycles.
5. Constraints: The main constraint for this method is the requirement for sufficient data on individual detection histories and relevant covariates to ensure accurate estimation of survival and detection probabilities.
