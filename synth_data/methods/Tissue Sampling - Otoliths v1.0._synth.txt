2. Abstract:
This method describes the process of collecting and preserving fish specimens for further study, including the removal of otoliths as an essential part of identifying species and aging. By accurately recording relevant data such as date, stream location, species identification, sex, fork length, and MEPS length, researchers can create a valuable database for ecological studies.

3. Description:
The method begins with the process of collecting a fish specimen from a stream and noting down its UTM coordinates, species, sex, and body measurements such as fork and MEPS lengths on a scale card. The next step involves preserving the fish specimen by removing its otoliths (ear bones), which help in determining the age and growth rate of the fish. To remove the otoliths, researchers make two cuts behind the eyes and above the eyes using a saw before carefully extracting them with forceps. Once extracted, they must clean the otoliths by removing tissue residue and place them in a small plastic vial for storage. The vial should be placed inside a labeled scale envelope and sealed for future reference.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to provide clear guidelines on collecting, preparing, and preserving fish specimens, specifically by removing and storing their otoliths as part of the process.

5. Constraints:
Some constraints for this method include potential difficulties in accurately identifying species, determining the sex of the fish, and properly extracting otoliths without causing damage to them. Additionally, ensuring accurate UTM coordinates, measurements, and appropriate labeling are crucial for further analysis and comparative studies.
