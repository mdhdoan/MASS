  "abstract": " This method is used to identify and classify different types of habitats in a stream for salmonids, based on measurable physical characteristics. Due to the various types and complexities of habitats found in an aquatic system, this process can be time-consuming as it requires field practitioners to physically survey each reach using GPS technology to record habitat types and their locations. The data is then processed to create a map of the stream section.\n\nHabitat types are classified into two formats: polylines and polygons, with the choice of format depending on the channel size and data collection precision required for accurate representation. Polyline format is typically used for smaller channels below 20m bankfull width while polygon format is used for larger channels. In some instances, both formats may be employed during a single survey.\n\nThe method assumes a moderate flow level when rating habitat types, as all months are given the same rating. Each habitat type is recorded as a percentage of the stream reach's wetted width. This approach helps ensure accurate and consistent data collection for effective habitat management in aquatic systems."

  "description": " This text describes the process of identifying and classifying habitat types in stream environments for salmonids, based on the methods outlined in Lestelle et al., 2004. The initial data collection for this parameter is labor-intensive due to the abundant heterogeneity of habitat types encountered in aquatic systems.\n\nField practitioners are required to physically walk each reach of the stream using a Global Positioning System (GPS) to georeference each habitat type. Afterwards, they post-process the GPS data to create a map of the reach. The habitat types are recorded in two formats: polyline or polygon. The choice of format depends on the wetted/bankfull channel size and data collection precision and effort. Polyline format is typically used for channels less than 20 meters bankfull width, while polygon format is employed for larger channels. In some instances, both formats may be used during a single survey effort to provide the most accurate representation of relative habitat abundances for a stream section.\n\nIt is important to note that all months are rated the same for this attribute, assuming a moderate flow level. However, it is acknowledged that the relative amount of certain habitat types can vary significantly at different flow levels. When rating this attribute, the percentage of the stream reach wetted width for each specific habitat type is entered as a point estimate."

  "constraints": " Based on the provided text, here are the constraints applicable to the method for labeling habitat types in a stream:\n\n1. The initial data collection for this parameter is labor intensive and requires physical inspection of each reach by field practitioners (Lestelle et al., 2004).\n2. Habitat types are recorded as either a polyline or polygon format, depending on the wetted/bankfull channel size and data collection precision and effort (Text).\n3. The choice of format should provide the most accurate representation of relative habitat abundances for a stream section (Text).\n4. A moderate flow level is assumed when rating this attribute (Text).\n5. Habitat types are entered as a point estimate of the percentage of the stream reach wetted width for the particular habitat type (Text).\n\nThere is no code provided in the text."
