  "abstractText": "Monitoring for pulses of drifting White Sturgeonlarvae isparamount in maximizing effectiveness when collecting larvaefor conservation aquaculture purposes.The larval monitoring process begins in early June when water temperatures reach 14 degrees celcius, as that is when White Sturgeon spawn in the Upper Columbia. The monitoring setup is deployed with the nets being placedin the main river channel.The nets are pulled daily and sorted to count numbers of larvae caught. Once increasing numbers of larvae are detected on consecutive days it signals an incoming pulse where larval sturgeon numbers drifting in the main river channel. After this pulse is detected the main larval collection process is begun.Two monitoring stations are deployed",
