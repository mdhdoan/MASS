2. Abstract: Age estimation in fish is crucial for studying population dynamics and managing fisheries. Traditional methods like otoliths have limitations, especially for scaleless fish. The use of fin rays or spines offers a reliable alternative for age estimation without requiring the sacrifice of fish. This method is non-destructive, field-friendly, and time-efficient, making it an ideal choice for fisheries management and research.
3. Description: Fin rays or spines are popular structures used for aging various fish species. These structures are particularly useful when other methods like otoliths are not reliable or applicable, such as in scaleless fish. Collection of fin rays and spines is typically done in the field, requiring minimal time. For spiny-rayed fishes, the first and second dorsal or anal spine are commonly used, while the leading pectoral or pelvic fin ray is preferred for soft-rayed fishes. The second dorsal fin's dorsal spine is often utilized to estimate the age of squalid sharks.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to provide an efficient, non-destructive, and reliable alternative for estimating fish ages in various contexts, such as fisheries management and research.
5. Constraints: Although using fin rays or spines for age estimation has several advantages, it may have limitations depending on the species. The availability and preservation of these structures can vary, potentially affecting the accuracy of age estimates. Additionally, specific techniques and expertise might be required to extract and analyze fin rays or spines from certain fish species.
