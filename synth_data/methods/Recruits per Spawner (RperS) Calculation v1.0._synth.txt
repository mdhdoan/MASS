2. Abstract: The method of using recruits per spawner (RperS) as a viable salmonid population (VSP) indicator is crucial in informing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) when making management decisions for ESA listed salmonids. This method provides a high-level overview that helps assess the health and sustainability of salmonid populations, enabling effective conservation efforts and ensuring compliance with endangered species regulations.

3. Description: The text introduces Recruits per Spawner (RperS) as a VSP indicator, which is used by NOAA to make informed management decisions regarding ESA listed salmonids. RperS is an important metric for evaluating the productivity and health of salmonid populations in their natural habitats. By monitoring RperS values over time, researchers can identify trends, fluctuations, or potential issues affecting these species' long-term viability. This information helps NOAA prioritize and implement appropriate conservation measures to protect vulnerable populations and maintain healthy ecosystems.

4. Target: The primary focus of the method is to serve as an indicator for informing NOAA in making effective management decisions for ESA listed salmonids, ensuring their survival and maintaining sustainable populations.

5. Constraints: This method's effectiveness relies on accurate data collection and analysis, which can be influenced by various factors such as environmental conditions, natural predators, human activities, or limitations in monitoring technology. Changes in these external factors may introduce uncertainty into RperS calculations and affect the reliability of VSP assessments.
