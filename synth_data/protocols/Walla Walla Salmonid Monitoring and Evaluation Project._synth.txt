 1. Abstract: The Walla Walla Basin Salmonid Monitoring and Evaluation Project is a collaborative effort between the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR), Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), and Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to monitor and evaluate the status and trends of salmonid populations in the Walla Walla Basin. The project aims to provide ecological information to support adaptive management for ESA recovery, population restoration, conservation, and preservation of cultural, social, and economic salmonid resources.
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes: The value of this project lies in its contribution to the recovery and preservation of threatened and endangered salmonid populations in the Walla Walla Basin. The problem statement is the lack of adequate information on Viable Salmonid Population parameters, such as abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity. The desired outcomes include estimating adult fish abundance and population productivity, understanding life history strategies and spatial structure of each population, and evaluating the viability of these populations to inform management decisions.
3. Description: The project focuses on monitoring and evaluation of steelhead and bull trout populations in the Walla Walla Basin using various methods such as mark-recapture, video monitoring, PIT-tagging, and fish surveys. Collaboration with USGS allows for monitoring of stream flow and water temperatures. The project also involves fish salvage operations and analysis of body scales to estimate age structure and stray rates of Chinook salmon. These methods are used to estimate various population parameters and evaluate the viability of each population, providing valuable information for management decisions related to ESA recovery and conservation efforts.
4. Objectives: The main objective of this project is to provide ecological information to support adaptive management for ESA recovery, population restoration, conservation, and preservation of cultural, social, and economic salmonid resources in the Walla Walla Basin. This objective covers the entire problem statement by addressing the need for adequate information on Viable Salmonid Population parameters. Keywords: salmonid monitoring, adaptive management, ESA recovery, population restoration, conservation, cultural resources.
5. Target: The primary focus of this protocol is to monitor and evaluate the status and trends of salmonid populations in the Walla Walla Basin.
6. Constraints: The constraints for this protocol include funding limitations, coordination between multiple agencies and tribes, data collection and analysis challenges, and the need to comply with regulations related to endangered species protection.
