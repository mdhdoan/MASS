 Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here are five keywords that are relevant to the method being described in the text:

1. Condition sampling
2. Fish passage
3. Disease symptoms
4. External marks (e.g., fin clips, pit-tags)
5. Barge loading

**Abstract:**

Condition sampling is a critical method used as part of the Salmon Monitoring Program (SMP) to assess the health and wellbeing of migratory juvenile salmon. This method involves daily inspections of fish passing through dams, with a focus on identifying signs of damage or disease that may indicate problems in fish passage, such as debris in bypass apparatus. By collecting data on external signs of disease and other injuries, condition sampling can provide a relative indication of the overall health of fish populations. Additionally, this method involves gathering detailed information about individual fish, including length and weight data, fin clips, and other external marks, which can be used for tracking and monitoring purposes.

**Description:**

Condition sampling is a key component of the SMP, which aims to monitor the health and wellbeing of migratory juvenile salmon as they pass through dams. This method involves daily inspections of fish by trained personnel, who look for signs of damage or disease that may indicate problems in fish passage. Specifically, condition sampling focuses on identifying the proportion of each species of salmon that are descaled or have significant injuries, as these can be indicative of issues with debris in fish bypass apparatus.

In addition to identifying signs of damage and disease, condition sampling also involves collecting data on other factors that can affect fish health, such as predation and exposure to environmental toxins. This information is collected through detailed observations and measurements, including length and weight data, fin clips, and the presence of coded wire tags or other external marks. At transportation sites, this information is necessary for making daily estimates of barge loading.

While condition sampling can provide valuable insights into fish health and wellbeing, it is important to note that external signs of disease should not be considered definitive indicators of overall population health. Further studies are needed to support any claims about the relationship between external symptoms and overall smolt population health.

**Target:**

The primary focus or goal of condition sampling is to assess the health and wellbeing of migratory juvenile salmon as they pass through dams. This method aims to identify signs of damage or disease that may indicate problems in fish passage, and to collect detailed data on individual fish for tracking and monitoring purposes.

**Constraints:**

There are several constraints associated with condition sampling, including the need for trained personnel to conduct inspections and analyze data, as well as the need for specialized equipment to measure length and weight data. Additionally, there may be limitations in the accuracy and reliability of external signs of disease as indicators of overall population health, which may require further studies to validate. Finally, condition sampling can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring significant investments in personnel, equipment, and other resources to implement effectively.
