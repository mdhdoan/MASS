2. Abstract: Regularly measuring and monitoring stream and river water temperatures can provide valuable insights into potential water quality concerns. To ensure the collected data is accurate and reliable, it is necessary to conduct field visits during the deployment of data loggers. These visits serve a dual purpose - they allow for visual checks to confirm that the data loggers are correctly installed and functioning properly, while also providing an opportunity to verify the accuracy of the data being recorded.
3. Description: The method described in the text involves monitoring water temperatures in streams and rivers as a means of identifying potential water quality issues. Data loggers are deployed to record temperature readings at regular intervals. To ensure the data collected is accurate, field visits are conducted during the deployment process. These visits serve two primary functions: first, they enable visual checks to confirm that the data loggers are correctly installed and have not been dislodged or damaged; second, they allow for the accuracy of the data being recorded to be verified. By comparing the readings from the data loggers with manual temperature measurements taken during the field visit, any discrepancies or inaccuracies can be identified and addressed.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to ensure the accuracy and reliability of water temperature data collected from streams and rivers, which can then be used to inform water quality assessments and identify potential concerns.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method include the need for regular field visits to verify data logger accuracy and functionality, as well as the requirement for manual temperature measurements to be taken during these visits. Additionally, there may be limitations or challenges associated with accessing certain waterways, particularly in remote or hard-to-reach locations.
