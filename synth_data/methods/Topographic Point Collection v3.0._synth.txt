2. Abstract: Topographic surveying is a critical method used to capture X, Y, and Z coordinates as points and lines representing the topographic surface of stream channels and floodplains. This process involves efficient and strategic collection of data points, taking into account the size, complexity, and slope changes of the site. The collected data is attributed with description codes to represent various features in the stream channel. The creation of a high-quality Digital Elevation Model (DEM) significantly depends on the number, distribution, and accuracy of these topographic points and lines.
3. Description: Topographic surveying aims to collect a sufficient number of data points and lines that accurately depict the surface topography of stream channels and floodplains. The complexity of the site plays a crucial role in determining the number of points required, with complex terrains requiring a higher density (1,000-1,200 points) compared to simple planar topographies (500-600 points). It is essential to focus on capturing inflection points, which represent changes in slope and are critical for accurate DEM creation.

When surveying streambed topography, it is necessary to concentrate on the bedform of the channel rather than individual elements of bed roughness like substrate. Proper extension of survey points into the floodplain ensures that all large and small side channels are included in areas where lateral migration may occur. Applying appropriate description codes based on topographic features enables better representation of various components in the stream channel.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to collect high-quality, representative topographic data points and lines for accurate DEM creation, providing valuable information for floodplain management, water resource planning, and environmental studies.
5. Constraints: Time limitations, site complexity, and accessibility can pose challenges in capturing the required number of data points and lines for an accurate DEM. Ensuring that inflection points are adequately represented and avoiding capturing unnecessary bed roughness elements require careful planning and execution during field surveys.
