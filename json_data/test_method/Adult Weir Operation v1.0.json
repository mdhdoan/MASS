  "abstractText": "In-stream adult picket weirs are used as a tool forcapturing, marking, and collecting biological data on returning adult runs of anadromous salmon and steelhead (e.g., Chinook and Coho salmon). Weirs also enable the implementation of management sliding scales. Collected data are utilized in estimating abundance, survival and life history characteristics, and evaluating hatchery effectiveness and population status and trends. Population status and trend monitoring of natural and hatchery origin fish is critical to effective population management, assessing effectiveness of conservation actions and population viability, and evaluating recovery metrics.The date of weir operations depends on the run-timing of the species, location and elevation of the trap site and annual environmental conditions. Spring-summer Chinook salmon adult traps typically begin operation in mid-June when high-water spring flows decrease allowing a safe installation. Adult traps are operated continuously through the spring-summer Chinook salmon spawning season and are removed during the end of September. Fall Chinook salmon and Coho salmon adult traps are installed and operated continuously from late September to early December. Each salmon trap generally experience no in-operable days due to low water and favorable trapping conditions. Steelhead traps are usually installed the beginning of February and operated until mid-June. All attempts are made to operate steelhead traps continuously, but because of high spring flows trapping conditions are often unsafe or damaged equipment can cause extended days of non-operation.",
