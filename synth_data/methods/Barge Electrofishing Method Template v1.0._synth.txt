 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the keywords relevant to the method:

1. Electrofishing method customization
2. PNAMP electrofishing experts
3. Objective/purpose setting
4. Sampling objectives
5. Equipment manuals

Now, let's move on to the abstract, description, target, and constraints.

Abstract:
The text presents a template for users to customize their electrofishing method. The template is designed to standardize the documentation of an electrofishing method by providing guidance from PNAMP electrofishing experts. The template includes questions that represent various sampling objectives such as specimen collection, species presence-absence, and relative abundance. Users are advised not to guess if they don't know the answer and instead consult helpful sources like equipment manuals.

Description:
The text provides a detailed guide on how to customize an electrofishing method using a template. The template includes questions that represent guidance from PNAMP electrofishing experts for developing a method. The purpose of the template is not to standardize responses but rather to standardize how an electrofishing method is documented. Some of the questions have a multiple-choice component, and users are advised not to guess if they don't know the answer. Instead, they are encouraged to consult helpful sources such as equipment manuals.

Target:
The primary focus or goal of the method is to provide a standardized way of documenting an electrofishing method by customizing a template based on guidance from PNAMP electrofishing experts.

Constraints:
There are no explicit constraints mentioned in the text, but users are advised not to guess if they don't know the answer and instead consult helpful sources such as equipment manuals.
