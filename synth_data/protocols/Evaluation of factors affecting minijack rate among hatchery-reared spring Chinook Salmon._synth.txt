 1. Abstract: This text discusses the issue of precocious male maturation in hatchery-reared spring Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), specifically focusing on minijacks. It highlights the negative impact of minijacks on hatchery programs due to economic and management losses, as they do not contribute to natural production or reach large sizes suitable for harvest fisheries. The text also explores factors influencing precocious male maturation, including growth rate, lipid content, genetics, broodstock age, and dietary supplementation with tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA).

2. Values, Statements and Outcomes: 
   - Values: Understanding the factors influencing minijack rates in hatchery-reared spring Chinook Salmon to improve management strategies and minimize economic losses.
   - Problem Statement: High minijack rates in hatchery-reared male spring Chinook Salmon lead to reduced harvest fishery yields and decreased contributions to natural production.
   - Desired outcomes: Identify the effects of broodstock age, dietary supplementation with TTA, and other factors on minijack rates to optimize hatchery management practices and reduce economic losses.

3. Description: The text provides a detailed analysis of various factors affecting precocious male maturation in hatchery-reared spring Chinook Salmon. It discusses the impact of broodstock age, specifically comparing age 3 and age 4 broodstock, on minijack rates. Additionally, it examines the effects of dietary supplementation with TTA on minijack rates. The text also explores the relationship between growth divergence, environmental factors, genetics, and minijack rates.

4. Objectives:
   - Objective: Investigate the influence of broodstock age, dietary supplementation with TTA, and other factors on minijack rates in hatchery-reared spring Chinook Salmon.
   - Summary of Solution Coverage: The objective addresses the entire problem statement by exploring various factors that can help minimize economic losses due to high minijack rates.
   - Keywords: broodstock age, dietary supplementation with TTA, growth divergence, genetics, environmental factors, hatchery management practices, economic losses, and minijack rates.

5. Target: Optimizing hatchery management practices for spring Chinook Salmon through understanding the factors affecting minijack rates.

6. Constraints: The effectiveness of hatchery management strategies may be limited by environmental factors and genetic predispositions that are difficult to control or predict.
