 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are five relevant keywords related to the method described in the text body:

1. Genetic stock identification (GSI)
2. Individual assignment
3. Coded-wire tag (CWT)
4. Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags
5. Mixed-stock populations

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract:
This method involves using genetic stock identification (GSI) and individual assignment to estimate the origins of juvenile salmon sampled in the ocean from mixed-stock populations. GSI is a technique that uses genetic markers to identify the population origin of individual fish, while individual assignment involves estimating the probability that an individual fish belongs to each possible stock. This method also involves examining fish for the presence of marks and tags, including coded-wire tags (CWT) and Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags, which provide additional information about the fish's origin and movement. By using these methods, researchers can better understand the distribution and abundance of different salmon stocks in the ocean.

3. Description:
The text body describes a method for estimating the stock origins of mixed-stock populations of juvenile salmon sampled in the ocean. This method involves collecting fish and extracting DNA samples, which are then analyzed using GSI to determine their population origin. Individual assignment is also used to estimate the probability that an individual fish belongs to each possible stock. In addition, all fish are examined for the presence of marks and tags. Data for CWTs found in the samples are obtained from the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) Regional Mark Processing Center (RMPC) database, while PIT data are obtained from the PSMFC Pit Tag Information System (PTAGIS) database.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to estimate the stock origins of mixed-stock populations of juvenile salmon sampled in the ocean using GSI and individual assignment, as well as data from CWTs and PIT tags.

5. Constraints:
There are a few constraints to this method. Firstly, it relies on the availability and accuracy of genetic markers for each possible stock. Secondly, the success of individual assignment depends on the amount and quality of DNA obtained from each fish. Thirdly, the effectiveness of using CWTs and PIT tags to infer fish origin and movement is dependent on their proper deployment, retention, and detection. Finally, this method requires access to databases such as those maintained by the PSMFC to obtain relevant information about the marks and tags found in the samples.
