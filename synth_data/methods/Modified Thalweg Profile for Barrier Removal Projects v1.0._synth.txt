2. Abstract:
Thalweg profiling is a method for quantifying stream morphology and fish habitat characteristics by surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream. This technique provides important measures of stream channel morphology and fish habitat, and can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements. Thalweg profiling has become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, particularly as part of barrier removal monitoring efforts in larger river systems like the Columbia River Basin.
3. Description:
Thalweg profiling involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream, which yields a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations. Depressions in the profile represent pools or deeper habitats with low velocity during low flow periods, while crests in the profile represent riffles. This method can provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology, such as stream channel gradient, and fish habitat, such as variation in pool depth. Thalweg profiling is an effective tool for monitoring changes to stream habitat because it is relevant to the biotic endpoint, responsive to management impacts, appropriate to the stream network, and measurable with acceptable precision and accuracy. It is also insensitive to differences in observers and flow conditions, and can be completed across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of thalweg profiling is to quantify stream morphology and fish habitat characteristics by surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of thalweg profiling is the need for specialized equipment, such as a depth gauge or sonar device, to accurately measure streambed elevations. Additionally, thalweg profiling may be time-consuming and labor-intensive, particularly in larger river systems with extensive stream networks. Finally, interpreting thalweg profile data requires some level of expertise in stream ecology and fish habitat assessment.
