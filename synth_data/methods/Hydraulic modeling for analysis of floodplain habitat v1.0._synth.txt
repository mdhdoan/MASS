2. Abstract: This method describes the use of hydraulic modeling, specifically the industry standard software HEC-RAS, for evaluating fish habitat preferences and instream restoration effectiveness in riverine systems. The model uses cross sectional topography to compute velocity, flow depth, shear stress, and other important characteristics. A custom interface called HEC-GeoRAS is used to map water surfaces, flow depths, and velocities, allowing for easy visualization of the data. This method provides a comprehensive solution for assessing and understanding floodplain connectivity and its relationship with fish habitat preferences.
3. Description: The text outlines a method for using hydraulic modeling software HEC-RAS to evaluate fish habitat preferences, instream restoration effectiveness, and floodplain connectivity in riverine systems. HEC-RAS is the industry standard for computing various hydraulic characteristics including velocity, flow depth, and shear stress. The team uses a custom interface, HEC-GeoRAS, between HEC-RAS and GIS to map water surfaces, flow depths and velocities, allowing for visualization of flow characteristic estimates throughout the channel. This interface tool helps in displaying and sharing geospatial data which is user-friendly. The process includes setting up reach cross-sectional topography and hydraulic characteristics, verifying the chosen characteristics, and running the model to obtain desired hydraulic calculation estimates.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is on using a sophisticated computer model for evaluating fish habitat preferences, instream restoration effectiveness and floodplain connectivity in riverine systems.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need for a sophisticated computer model (HEC-RAS), GIS software, and expertise to set up the reach cross-sectional topography, verify hydraulic characteristics, and interpret the results. Additionally, there may be limitations in obtaining accurate and detailed data on the riverine system.
