2. Abstract:
The private vessel bar crossing count method is a systematic approach to estimate the number of ocean recreational boats entering the ocean during daylight hours. This method involves making both outbound (OUT) and inbound (IN) counts for a set period, primarily between dawn and 10:00 AM. By comparing IN and OUT counts and interviewing a sample of boats, expansion factors are generated to estimate the total number of private boats that entered the ocean during the day. This method helps ensure accurate effort estimation for recreational fishing activities and informs resource management decisions.

3. Description:
The private vessel bar crossing count method focuses on counting private ocean recreational boats entering and exiting the ocean through a specific bar area during daylight hours, primarily from dawn to 10:00 AM. The primary objective is to estimate the total number of boats that enter the ocean by utilizing OUT counts and IN counts as a correction mechanism for early returning trips due to unfavorable weather or sea conditions.

The boat counter records both the starting and ending time of the count within the specified time frame, and if adjustments are necessary for early returning trips, the adjusted OUT count is recorded. The standard bar crossing method samples data from the week to determine the proportion of interviewed boats that crossed the bar either before or after the designated counting period. This information is then used to generate one or more expansion factors which are applied back to the OUT counts to estimate the total number of private boats that entered the ocean during the day.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to estimate the total number of private recreational boats entering the ocean during daylight hours, addressing the need for accurate effort estimation in recreational fishing activities and resource management decisions.

5. Constraints:
* The success of the private vessel bar crossing count method depends on consistent boat traffic and accurate recording by counters.
* Unpredictable weather conditions may impact the accuracy of OUT counts.
* Interviewing a sufficient number of boats is crucial for generating reliable expansion factors.
* Time constraints during dawn through 10:00 AM may pose challenges in making thorough counts and interviews.
