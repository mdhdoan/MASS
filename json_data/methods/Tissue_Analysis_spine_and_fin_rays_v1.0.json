  "abstractText": "Although spines of some species may be read whole (Logsdon 2007), including spines from squalid sharks, fin rays and spines are typically cut in cross section by means of a low-speed saw or jeweler's handsaw. Small spines and rays may be difficult to section because of their small size and fragility and are commonly mounted in epoxy. Rubber molds are commercially available for this purpose. Alternatively, molds can be fashioned by removing the tapered end from a microcentrifuge tube (Koch and Quist 2007). A small piece of modeling clay is then placed in the cap to hold the fin ray or spine in place while epoxy that has been added tot he tube cures.",
