2. Abstract: A method is described to prevent the spread of fish diseases and invasive species during fieldwork involving wading gear. A disinfection station is established with two wash tubs, one containing a disinfectant (Bardac 2250) and another with soap and water. Surveyors follow a procedure to wash and disinfect their gear prior to use at different sites, which includes wading boots, socks, and neoprene pants among other items. This method is crucial in maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems and preventing the spread of invasive species.
3. Description: The text details a method used to prevent the spread of fish diseases and invasive species during fieldwork involving wading gear. A disinfection station is established prior to the start of the field season, consisting of two wash tubs - one with Bardac 2250 as a disinfectant and another containing soap and water. The surveyors are required to wash and disinfect their gear using this station before using it at different sites. The list of items that need to be disinfected includes wading boots, socks, and neoprene pants among other things. The purpose of this method is to ensure that no fish diseases or invasive species are carried over from one site to another, thereby protecting the health of aquatic ecosystems.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to prevent the spread of fish diseases and invasive species during fieldwork involving wading gear.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the availability and cost of disinfectants like Bardac 2250, the time required to wash and disinfect gear before and after each use, and the need for surveyors to follow proper procedures to ensure effective disinfection. Additionally, the effectiveness of this method may be limited by the resistance or tolerance of certain species to the disinfectant used.
