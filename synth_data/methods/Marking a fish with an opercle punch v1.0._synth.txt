2. Abstract: The use of marks in mark-recapture abundance models for fish is crucial to estimate the population size of a species in a given area. An appropriate mark must be recognizable, not easily lost, and should not impact the behavior or survivability of the fish. This article discusses the choice of an opercle punch as a suitable mark for estimating spring spawning salmonids' abundance. The method was chosen due to its minimal intrusiveness and high visibility during cold spring water temperatures when the hole from the punch would not heal quickly.
3. Description: Mark-recapture methods in fish population estimation rely on using unique marks that can be recognized upon recapture. An opercle punch, a small tool creating a hole in the fish's operculum (the bony flap covering the gills), was selected for estimating spring spawning salmonids' abundance due to several reasons. Firstly, during cold water temperatures, the created hole would not heal quickly, ensuring the mark remains visible and recognizable upon recapture. Secondly, the small size of the tool and resulting hole cause minimal intrusiveness, which means it is unlikely to impact the behavior or survivability of the fish. This choice of mark allowed researchers to obtain accurate abundance estimates without causing undue harm to the fish population.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to determine the abundance of spring spawning salmonids using a recognizable, non-invasive, and reliable marking technique - an opercle punch.
5. Constraints: One constraint for this method is that it requires cold water temperatures during the spring season to ensure the hole from the punch does not heal quickly before recapture. Additionally, there may be limitations related to visibility or recognizability of the marks if the fish's operculum is damaged or worn out due to other environmental factors.
