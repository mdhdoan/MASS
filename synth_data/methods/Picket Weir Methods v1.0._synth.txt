2. Abstract: The use of fish weirs for installment and operation during spring and fall is an efficient and accurate method for enumerating and representative sampling of adult spring Chinook salmon. This method allows researchers to handle and collect fish, gathering vital information such as gender, size, and hatchery or natural origin. Regular checks and immediate processing minimize fish holding time, ensuring the well-being of the captured fish while providing essential data for research purposes.
3. Description: The necessity of this method arises from the need to accurately monitor and study Chinook salmon populations. Fish weirs are installed as early as possible in the spring, with dates controlled by access, water level, and debris in the stream. When operated throughout the adult return, these structures prove to be an efficient and accurate means of enumerating and sampling adults. Researchers benefit from handling fish directly, as they can collect information on gender, size, hatchery or natural origin, fork length, and CWTs (coded wire tags). The method emphasizes minimal handling for species other than Chinook salmon to ensure their well-being. Additionally, water temperature is measured during fish handling to maintain optimal conditions.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is the enumeration, sampling, and data collection of adult spring Chinook salmon populations with minimal impact on fish welfare.
5. Constraints: The successful implementation of this method depends on favorable snow conditions, appropriate water levels, and manageable debris in the stream. Furthermore, it requires consistent checks several times a day and adequate resources for immediate processing, handling, and data collection.
