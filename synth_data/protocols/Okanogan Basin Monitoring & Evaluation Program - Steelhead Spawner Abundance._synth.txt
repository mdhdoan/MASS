 1. Abstract: The Okanogan River subbasin monitors summer steelhead spawner abundance and distribution using redd surveys and PIT tag detections. Data is combined with a 'fish per redd' value and percent wild ratio to estimate total spawning abundance in unique subwatersheds and mainstem reaches. The objective is to track the number of adult salmon and steelhead, estimate hatchery vs natural origin spawners, and analyze spatial distribution trends toward historically available habitat.
2. Values, Statements, Outcomes: Values include effective management and conservation of summer steelhead populations; Problem Statement - lack of understanding of adult salmon and steelhead trends in the Okanogan River subbasin; Desired outcomes - recovery of adult salmon and steelhead populations, increased hatchery-natural spawner ratio, and wider spatial distribution.
3. Description: The OBMEP monitors steelhead spawner abundance using a census study design with methods outlined in Protocol #235 and Method #6927. Redd surveys provide annual information on spawners' spatial distribution, while PIT tag data determines their abundance and percent wild. Key aspects include the fish-per-redd value and sex ratio used to expand redd counts to total spawning escapement estimates.
4. Objectives: To determine if adult salmon and steelhead populations are recovering over time (addresses lack of trend understanding), estimate hatchery vs natural origin spawners, and analyze spatial distribution trends toward historically available habitat (all contributing to better management and conservation).
5. Target: Monitoring and analyzing summer steelhead populations in the Okanogan River subbasin.
6. Constraints: Availability of accurate and consistent data, potential limitations of monitoring methods, variations in sex ratio and environmental factors affecting spawner abundance and distribution.
