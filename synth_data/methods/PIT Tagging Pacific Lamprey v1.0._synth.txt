 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are five relevant keywords related to the method discussed in the text body:

1. Anadromous fishes
2. PIT telemetry
3. Fishways
4. Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags
5. Lampreys

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract:
Anadromous fishes, such as lampreys, have complex life cycles that make them vulnerable to environmental and anthropogenic changes. To monitor and improve their passage efficiency in mainstem rivers and tributaries, PIT telemetry has been widely used with fixed-site PIT arrays. This method involves the use of Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags, which are inexpensive, non-invasive, and allow for indefinite tag life. The resulting detections provide valuable data on fish movement, including passage success, duration, and timing, which can inform structural and operational modifications to fishways.
3. Description:
The text body discusses the use of PIT telemetry to document passage efficiency of anadromous fishes in mainstem rivers, tributaries, and at barriers within these environments. The focus is on using PIT tags to monitor Pacific Lamprey passage success at dams. Fixed-site PIT arrays are strategically positioned to detect PIT tagged fish passing through specific areas of interest in the fishways. The resulting detections are then used to document passage success, duration, and timing of fish movements. The text also notes that while fishway designs have traditionally focused on maximizing salmonid passage efficiencies, fishes that do not share salmonid migration behaviors may not respond positively to these configurations. PIT tags are described as inexpensive, non-invasive, and featuring a unique alpha-numeric ID number that allows an individually tagged lamprey to be identified whenever it is detected.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to monitor and improve the passage efficiency of anadromous fishes, specifically Pacific Lampreys, in mainstem rivers and tributaries using PIT telemetry and fixed-site PIT arrays.
5. Constraints:
One constraint for this method is that fishway designs have traditionally focused on maximizing salmonid passage efficiencies, which may not be optimal for fishes with different migration behaviors. Additionally, the success of this method relies on the accuracy and reliability of PIT tag detections in fishways.
