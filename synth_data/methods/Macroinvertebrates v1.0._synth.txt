2. Abstract: This study outlines a method to assess freshwater productivity by investigating energy sources for downstream food webs and examining benthic macroinvertebrate composition. By following the sampling methods described in Wipfli and Gregovich (2002) and Peck et al. (2001), researchers will capture invertebrates, organic matter, and debris from fishless and fish-bearing streams. The data gathered using these techniques will contribute to understanding freshwater ecosystem health and productivity, helping inform management strategies and conservation efforts.
3. Description: The methodology includes the export of aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, as well as coarse organic detritus, from headwaters to downstream habitats. Investigators will follow the methods outlined in Wipfli and Gregovich (2002) for assessing energy sources for downstream food webs. This approach involves placing sampling stations near tributary junctions of both fishless and fish-bearing streams, using specially modified drift nets to capture invertebrates and particulate organic matter. Data will be reported as numbers per day and dry mass (mg) per day for invertebrate transport, while debris transport will be recorded as dry mass (g) per m^3 water and dry mass (g) per day. The study will also analyze benthic macroinvertebrate composition using the targeted-riffle-sample method described in Peck et al. (2001). This process entails collecting at least eight independent kick-net samples from riffles within sites or reaches, combining them, sieving to remove debris and sediments, and then processing in a lab according to RIVPACS guidelines.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is evaluating freshwater productivity through the examination of energy sources for downstream food webs and benthic macroinvertebrate composition.
5. Constraints: This methodology requires monthly data collection, specialized equipment (drift nets), lab processing, and trained personnel to conduct field sampling and analyze samples according to established guidelines. Adherence to the described methods in Wipfli and Gregovich (2002) as well as Peck et al. (2001) is essential for obtaining accurate results. Furthermore, potential limitations include variations in macroinvertebrate composition due to seasonal or environmental factors, which may require additional research to account for these fluctuations and ensure the accuracy of the findings.
