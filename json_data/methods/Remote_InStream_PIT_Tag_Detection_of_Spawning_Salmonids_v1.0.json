  "abstractText": "Hatchery fish may not produce as many progeny as natural fish in natural environments for a variety of reasons. For example, hatchery fish may select inappropriate areas to spawn (e.g., poor water flows or depths), spawn at inappropriate times (Leider et al. 1984), or construct redds inappropriately (e.g., dig redds that are too shallow to withstand flooding).The the ability to identify individual fish on redds and correlatedetectedPIT tags with biological data (e.g., origin)collected from previous tagging and/or recapture eventswould bebeneficial to begin to understand the factors that may influence differential reproductive success between hatchery and wild fish spawning in the natural environment.",
