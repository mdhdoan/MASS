Employ the use of electrofishing, remote PIT tagging, mark-recapture events, and in-stream PIT tag antennas to assess utilization of tributaries to the mainstem of a river by juvenile salmonids and to determine population estimates. Calculations used to estimate the abundance in the site as well as expansion to reach and tributary are provided below.",
