2. Abstract: Beach seining is an effective method used to capture fishes in various aquatic habitats for study purposes or population management. This non-destructive and time-efficient technique involves deploying a large net in shallow waters, allowing researchers to sample fish populations without causing significant stress or harm. Seining's success depends on factors such as habitat features, water conditions, targeted fish species, seasonality, net design, and deployment methods. By accounting for these factors, beach seining can serve as an accurate method for calculating fish population density and biomass.

3. Description: Beach seining is a fishing method that captures fishes in rivers, estuaries, nearshore lake, reservoir, and marine habitats. It is particularly useful in shallow waters with limited obstructions where fish are highly concentrated (Pierce et al. 1990). The technique involves deploying a long, weighted net called a seine, forming a large pocket to encircle and retain fishes. Seining offers several advantages:

a. Effectiveness: It captures less mobile species efficiently but may also catch more agile ones like adult salmon in specific conditions.
b. Sampling scope: Seining allows researchers to sample extensive areas quickly and release captured fish with minimal stress or harm, provided the net is kept in water and fish are not overcrowded.
c. Habitat considerations: Seining's success depends on the habitat features of the target site. Irregular bottom topography, debris accumulation, larger rocks, or dense aquatic vegetation may hinder seining due to net snagging or reduced fish retention. Current velocity and depth also influence site selection and net design.
d. Net variations: Seines vary in size and design based on the targeted species' life stage and population distribution. Calibration studies and underwater observations can help optimize the method.
e. Data collection: Rectangular arc set beach seining facilitates fish/set, fish/area, or fish/volume analysis by measuring length, width, and depth. This approach is consistent and accurate, especially for smaller fish that are not easily alarmed or prone to escaping slow-moving nets.

4. Target: The primary focus of beach seining is to capture fishes in various aquatic habitats efficiently while minimizing stress, harm, and environmental impact.

5. Constraints: Beach seining's effectiveness is limited by factors such as habitat features (bottom topography, debris, vegetation), water conditions (current velocity, depth), fish species (mobility, behavior), time of year and day, net design, deployment method, and cost constraints related to gear, boats, and personnel.
