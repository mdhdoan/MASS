  "abstractText": "Because velocity and depth typically vary greatly across a stream, accuracy in field measurements is achieved by measuring the mean velocity and flow cross-sectional area of many increments across a channel (Figure 22). Each increment gives a subtotal of the stream discharge, and the whole is calculated as the sum of these parts. Discharge measurements are made at only one carefully chosen channel cross-section. It is important to choose a channel cross-section that is as much like a canal as possible. A glide area with a U-shaped channel cross-section that is free of obstructions provides the best conditions for measuring discharge. You may remove rocks and other obstructions to improve the cross-section before any measurements are made.",
