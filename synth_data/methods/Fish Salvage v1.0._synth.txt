2. Abstract:
Fish salvage operations are essential for the survival of fish populations in the Walla Walla River, which faces significant challenges due to heavy irrigation diversions. These operations involve collaborative efforts between various organizations and local crews to safely remove fish from perilous passage conditions and release them into nearby free-flowing areas of the river. The primary goal is non-quantitative, focusing on fish welfare, while quantitative species counts are utilized for Endangered Species Act reporting and monitoring presence/absence indices.

3. Description:
The Walla Walla River's heavily diverted water is a major obstacle for fish migration, particularly during the irrigation season. Cooperating organizations and O&M crews work together to salvage fish from dangerous passage conditions at various sites along the river, including diversion dams, irrigation canals, and hatchery intakes. The Walla Walla Salmonid Monitoring and Evaluation (WWSM&E) project relies on O&M crew expertise to lower water levels, enabling safe capture and transfer of fish using seines or backpack electrofishing gear. Captured fish are placed in aerated buckets with cool water, identified by species, and recorded for data collection purposes. Although the main objective is non-quantitative (focused on fish safety), quantitative species counts serve secondary goals like Endangered Species Act reporting and monitoring species presence/absence.

4. Target:
The primary target of this method is to ensure the safe removal and relocation of fish from perilous passage conditions in the Walla Walla River, with a secondary focus on gathering quantitative data for regulatory compliance and species monitoring.

5. Constraints:
Constraints for fish salvage operations include the availability of O&M crews, water management requirements for irrigation purposes, accessibility of diversion sites, and seasonal restrictions near the start or end of the irrigation season. Additionally, potential limitations related to fish capture methods (such as seines or electrofishing gear) and data collection may pose challenges in accurately quantifying species counts during salvage operations.
