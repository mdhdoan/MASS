  "abstractText": "Being able to correctly identify project origin adults upon return is critical to the monitoring and evaluating any enhancement/reintroduction program. Due to the small size at emigration of chum salmon fry most marking techniques used for other salmonids (CWT, PIT, fin or maxillary clips) are not possible. While fin or maxillary clips are possible to apply if the fry are reared to a larger size (~55-60mm in fl), they both carry additional stresses, risk and cost. Thermal marking of boney structures allows for marking with no impact and can be done while the eggs/fry are still in the incubation trays. A schedule of thermal changes applied during incubation will produce a bar code like mark that is recognizable and unique (see picture).",
