2. Abstract:
This method outlines the process of quantifying the size distribution of substrates in fast-moving water environments. By measuring 11 particles from 10 cross-sections for a total of 110 particles per site, researchers can obtain valuable information about the characteristics of these habitats. Additionally, this approach includes an estimate of cobble embeddedness, which has been adjusted in 2013 to reduce the number of measured particles from 210 to 110 for increased efficiency and reduced resource requirements.

3. Description:
The method is aimed at determining the size distribution of substrates in fast water habitats by measuring a specific number of particles per cross-section. In the revised version of the method (2013), the total number of measured particles has been decreased from 210 to 110, obtained by sampling 10 cross-sections with 11 particles each. This change was made to improve efficiency and reduce resource usage without compromising the quality of data gathered.

The method also includes an estimation of cobble embeddedness, which provides insights into habitat stability and sediment dynamics. While this step is not explicitly described in the text body, it can be inferred as a relevant aspect of the overall process given its mention in the context of changes made for 2013.

4. Target:
The primary focus of the method is to provide a systematic and efficient approach for quantifying substrate size distribution and embeddedness estimation in fast water habitats.

5. Constraints:
The constraints for this method include ensuring accurate measurement of selected particles, as well as accounting for potential variations in particle shape, size, and density within each sampled cross-section. Additionally, the reduction of measured particles from 210 to 110 may impact data accuracy; thus, it is essential to consider possible implications on the quality and reliability of results when applying this revised method.
