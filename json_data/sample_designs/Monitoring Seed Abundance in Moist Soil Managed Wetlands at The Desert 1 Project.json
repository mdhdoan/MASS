  "description": "<p>Moist soil management is a valuable tool for the managing of wetland habitats and the wildlife species associated with wetlands.&nbsp; The ability to manage water levels, create disturbance, and manipulate vegetation to allow for more productive early successional&nbsp;wetland habitats is crucial to the TD-1 project. &nbsp; Moist soil management provides critical habitat and food sources for wetland obligate and wetland associated species, while also allowing for valuable recreation opportunities.&nbsp; During April and May of 2017 Columbia Basin Wildlife Area staff harrowed and seeded four wetland cells, harrowed one wetland cell and left unseeded, and left one wetland cell un-harrowed and unseeded in the Desert Project 1.&nbsp; All cells had varying degrees of soil moisture and composition allowing WDFW staff to assess where seeding is most beneficial.&nbsp; Wetland cells that were seeded had Proso Millet,&nbsp;Wild Millet, and Smartweed planted.&nbsp; Millet planted was spread by a broadcast seeder at the rate of 20 lbs. /acre and Smartweed as mixed in with the Millet at the rate of 10 lbs. /acre.&nbsp; WDFW staff has always seen the benefit in seeding wetlands and providing food sources for migrating waterfowl.&nbsp; However, information on how seeded wetlands versus naturally establishing wetlands compare had not been investigated.&nbsp; Through this analysis, we hoped to gain the data to support that seeded wetlands are producing more seed biomass of desirable plant species.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200b</p>\r\n",
