2. Abstract: The method discussed focuses on the estimation of the percentage distribution of substrate materials for each channel unit based on defined substrate classes in a given table. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding and categorization of various substrates within different channel units, ultimately solving the need to efficiently analyze and compare substrate compositions across multiple channel units.
3. Description: The method involves visually estimating the percent distribution of substrate materials for individual channel units based on a set of predefined substrate classes outlined in Table 15. This process forms part of the ocular channel unit substrate composition attribute detailed in section 8 of a specific protocol. By carefully examining and categorizing substrates according to these classes, researchers can gain valuable insights into the composition of various channel units.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to classify and quantify substrate materials within individual channel units, enabling comparative analysis between different units.
5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method may include subjectivity in visual estimation, accuracy limitations due to the inherent nature of estimation, and the necessity of referencing Table 15 for accurate substrate classification.
