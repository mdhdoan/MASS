  "background": "Precocious male maturation occurs in spring run Chinook SalmonOncorhynchus tshawytscha, both as subyearlings (precocial parr) and as age 1+ juveniles (minijacks) (Thorpe 1994; Sloat et al. 2014). While rates of precocious maturation in wild stocks is thought to be very low (less than 5%), the proportion of juvenile males maturing as minijacks in hatchery populations has been observed to be as high as 80% (Harstad et al. 2014). Minijacks apparently will initiate out-migration along with the other non-maturing smolts, however they do not continue to the ocean for overwintering, nor do they return to their natal spawning areas and participate in natural production (Zimmerman et al. 2003; Beckman and Larsen 2005). Production of minijacks therefore, represents an economic and management loss to a hatchery programs whose objective(s) is to produce large adult size fish for harvest fisheries and/or adults to supplement the naturally spawning population.Studies indicate that exceeding a threshold level for growth and lipid content during the fall one year following egg fertilization, will induce hatchery-reared juvenile male Chinook Salmon to precociously initiate maturation and become fully mature minijacks by the following spawning season, 5-6 months following smolt release (Larsen et al. 2006; Mangel and Satterthwaite 2008; Spanenberg et al. 2014; Good and Davidson 2016). However, beyond environmental factors that may alter growth rate and adiposity of the juveniles, there is also evidence for genetic-based factors that influence precocious male maturation rate, apparent both among different stocks, as well as among individuals within stocks (Debes and Hutchings 2104; Harstad et al. 2014; Spanenberg et al. 2015).",
