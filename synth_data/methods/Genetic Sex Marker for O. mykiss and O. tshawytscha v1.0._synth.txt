2. Abstract: The necessity of sex-specific markers in fish species such as Chinook salmon and rainbow trout is highlighted in this article. A new method for detecting these markers using Y-chromosome specific primers (OtY3 for Chinook salmon and OmyY1 for rainbow trout) developed by Brunelli and Thorgaard (2008) is discussed. The authors have modified these protocols to allow for examination of this sex-specific region using other genetic platforms.
3. Description: This text discusses the development of new Y-chromosome specific markers for Chinook salmon (OtY3) and rainbow trout (OmyY1), which can be readily detected by PCR assays. The protocols developed by Brunelli and Thorgaard (2008) have been modified to allow for examination of this sex-specific region using other genetic platforms. The authors describe the protocols used in their lab to run sex markers for Chinook salmon and steelhead, while acknowledging that there may be other protocols and procedures available for interrogating this Y-chromosome region.
4. Target: Development of new Y-chromosome specific markers for Chinook salmon and rainbow trout, and modification of existing protocols to allow for examination using other genetic platforms.
5. Constraints: The use of these modified protocols is limited to the lab in which they were developed, and there may be other protocols and procedures available for interrogating this Y-chromosome region.
