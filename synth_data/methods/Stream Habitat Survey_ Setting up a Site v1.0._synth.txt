2. Abstract: A long-term monitoring program was established to assess and track the condition of salmon habitats over time. The program utilizes a combination of stream habitat surveys, juvenile snorkeling inventories, and spawning salmon surveys. These methods provide a comprehensive understanding of current salmon habitat conditions and enable the tracking of trends in habitat quality. The random selection of survey points using GIS ensures accurate and unbiased data collection.
3. Description: The long-term monitoring program consists of various field surveys, including stream habitat surveys, juvenile snorkeling inventories, and spawning salmon surveys. These surveys are designed to determine the current state of salmon habitats and track changes over time. A key aspect of the methodology is the use of GIS to randomly select survey points, ensuring accurate and unbiased data collection. The methods used for the habitat survey portion of the monitoring effort are similar to those used in basin surveys conducted by the ODFW Aquatic Inventories Project since 1990. However, due to the standard survey length of the monitoring sites, some measurements are taken at increased frequency, while others are omitted. These modifications are specific to the monitoring surveys and do not apply to the comprehensive basin survey.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to determine current salmon habitat conditions and track trends in habitat quality over time.
5. Constraints: One constraint for this method is the need to balance the increased frequency of some measurements with the omission of others due to the standard survey length of the monitoring sites. Additionally, the methods used must be specific to the monitoring surveys and cannot simply follow the comprehensive basin survey protocol.
