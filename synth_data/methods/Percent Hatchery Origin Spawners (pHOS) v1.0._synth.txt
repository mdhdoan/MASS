2. Abstract:
The pHOS or percent hatchery origin spawner is a crucial metric in calculating the Natural Origin Spawner Abundance (NOSA) indicator. This method addresses the need for accurately assessing the natural spawner population, which is vital for proper fish population management and maintaining ecological balance. By using this approach, managers can make informed decisions based on reliable data to conserve and manage aquatic resources effectively.

3. Description:
The pHOS, or percent hatchery origin spawner, is an essential metric in the NOSA indicator calculation. In fish population management, understanding the proportion of naturally spawned fish compared to those from hatcheries helps assess the health and sustainability of the population. The pHOS calculation method involves evaluating the number of natural origin spawners against the total number of spawners present. This information is then used in the NOSA indicator calculation, providing decision-makers with valuable insights for conservation and management efforts.

4. Target:
The primary goal of this method is to accurately determine the pHOS as part of the NOSA indicator calculation, ultimately supporting informed decisions in fish population management and conservation efforts.

5. Constraints:
Constraints for this method may include limitations in data collection, such as challenges in accurately identifying natural origin spawners versus hatchery-raised individuals. Additionally, environmental factors, variations in fish behavior, or human interference might affect the precision of pHOS estimation. Properly accounting for these constraints is crucial to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the NOSA indicator in guiding management decisions.
