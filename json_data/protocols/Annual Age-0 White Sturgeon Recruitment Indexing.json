  "background": "Recruitment of age-0 white sturgeonAcipenser transmontanusin the impounded reaches of the lower Columbia River (i.e., Bonneville, The Dalles, and John Day reservoirs)is assessed each year to identify and track status and trends in productivity (Cox 2015). This information is critical to the effective management of the resource, as dam construction and operation has negatively effected white sturgeon productivity in these reaches (Beamesderfer et al. 1995; Chapman and Jones 2010).This work, aspart of a larger program designed to develop and implement a management plan for enhancing production of white sturgeon in the lower Columbia River Basin, has helped identify physical and environmental conditions favorable to spawning and subsequent age-0recruitment within individual reservoirs.",
