 1. Keywords: Creel survey, tribal fisheries, platform fishery, hook and line fishery, gillnet fishery, ceremonial and subsistence fisheries, commercial fisheries.
2. Abstract: A Creel survey is a method used to collect data on recreational fishing. In this case, the survey is being conducted for tribal mainstem fisheries, which include platform, hook and line, and gillnet fisheries. These fisheries are grouped into ceremonial and subsistence fisheries, as well as commercial fisheries. The purpose of this survey is to gather essential information about these fisheries, allowing for effective management and sustainability.
3. Description: A Creel survey is a valuable tool for collecting data on recreational fishing activities. In this specific scenario, the focus is on tribal mainstem fisheries, which are further categorized into platform, hook and line, and gillnet fisheries. These fisheries play a significant role in both subsistence and commercial contexts. The survey will help classify the fisheries into ceremonial and subsistence or commercial groups, providing insights into the purpose and scale of these fishing operations. This detailed data will enable better decision-making for managing and conserving the fisheries resources.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to conduct a comprehensive Creel survey of tribal mainstem fisheries, ensuring sustainable management and resource conservation.
5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method could include limited cooperation from fishers, challenging environmental conditions affecting data collection, and resource limitations for conducting the survey.
