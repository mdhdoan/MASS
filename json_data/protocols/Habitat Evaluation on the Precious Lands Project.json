  "background": "Under the Northwest Power Planning Act, the Bonneville Power Administration was mandated to mitigate for wildlife habitat losses. In order to do that BPA must be able to measure the amount and quality of habitat lost and gained through their activities, including the Precious Lands project. The accounting system adopted by BPA is a habitat modeling strategy known as a Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP) developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This procedure uses models to measure the quality of a specific habitat for target wildlife species. The models are based on key habitat parameters (ex. shrub height, snag density, or distance to water) and provide a measure of the habitat quality for that particular species. One product of HEP is a quantitative evaluation of habitat quality that is provided in terms of a Habitat Unit (HU). One acre of optimum habitat equals one HU. This HU accounting system is used to determine the amount of credit BPA receives for the land being protected.While HSI models were initially used to evaluate the baseline condition of the Precious Lands Area, long-term monitoring will be conducted based on HEP data collection procedures, but not limited to particular wildlife variables. For example, percent microbiotic crust cover and percent bare ground are recorded for microplots in grasslands while the number of woody debris >4 diameter is recorded for transects in riparian and conifer cover types. Surveys will be used to assess long-term trends in plant community health, weedy encroachment, limiting factors for wildlife and identify/monitor areas of habitat degradation.",
