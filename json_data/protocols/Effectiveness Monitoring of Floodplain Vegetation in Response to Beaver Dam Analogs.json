  "background": "The Bridge Creek watershed is used by a by a run of Mid-Columbia steelhead that are part of the ecologically distinct and ESA (Endangered Species Act) threatened Lower John Day population. It is also used intermittently by Mid-Columbia Chinook salmon, another threatened population. Bridge Creek was listed as one of 11 tributary Major Spawning Areas (MaSAs) critical to the recovery of the Lower John Day steelhead Major Population Group (MPG), and was identified as having high restoration potential. Many areas along Bridge Creek have historically experienced high levels of incision, degradation, and high stream temperatures making them inhospitable to salmon populations.Floodplain connectivity and riparian structure were listed as a high restoration priority for the lower valley on Bridge Creek. Re-establishing both surface and groundwater connections between the stream and floodplain increases the amount and quality of fish habitat. Since 2009, beaver dam analogs (BDAs) have been installed in the area, encouraging beaver migration into the area and beaver dam formation (Pollock, et al. 2014). The damming of Bridge Creek has resulted in soil aggradation and floodplain inundation. Floodplain inundation promotes groundwater recharge and water table rise, which in turn support perennial streamflow, cooler water temperatures (due to groundwater upwelling), and riparian vegetation growth (Pollock et al. 2012). Riparian vegetation provides shade and organic inputs to the stream ecosystem (e.g., prey, woody debris, leaf litter) which improves fish habitat quality (Pollock et al. 2012). In addition, riparian vegetation is also critical for supporting and maintaining stable beaver colonies, which are an important part of the Bridge Creek restoration strategy. Finally, connected floodplains can also directly provide important off-channel refuge for fish during high flows, expand rearing areas, and increase foraging opportunities (Pollock et al. 2012).This protocol presents aframework by which to monitor the effectiveness of the Bridge Creek restoration efforts in transforming incised stream networks intohealthy, functioning riparian ecosystems. It outlines whichvegetative and landscape factors should be measured to determine riparian health. It will also address the restoration methods specific toBridge Creek, with variables that take into account the impact ofBDAsand beaver introduction on floodplain vegetation and landscape structure. By repeating this survey protocol over multiple years, temporal trends in vegetation and landscape may be observed. The survey methods implemented in this protocol are supported by the methodologies outlined in two other government-agency led reports: the multiple indicator monitoringof stream channels andstreamsidevegetation (MIM2011), and thePACFISH/INFISHeffectiveness monitoring program for sampling vegetation in streams and riparian areas (PIBO-EM2008). These two protocols helped guide us in choosing important riparian indicators to measure and allows us to place this effectiveness monitoring protocol in the context of other monitoring studies.",
