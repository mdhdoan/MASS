2. Abstract: This method is derived from an Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) protocol for monitoring western wadable streams. It focuses on determining the extent of channel constraint within the floodplain. Channel constraint, whether natural or man-made, impacts the formation of a stream's channel and banks through erosion and deposition. This greatly influences the quality and quantity of habitat for aquatic organisms and the type of adjustments needed to address alterations in flow and sediment supply or direct channel manipulations such as dredging, revetments, and impoundment.

3. Description: The method is based on an EMAP protocol developed for monitoring western wadable streams. It includes instructions for determining the extent of channel constraint within the floodplain. Channel constraint can result from both natural factors and human activities. The presence of immovable or non-erodible river margins restricts a stream's ability to form its own channel and banks through scouring and deposition. The degree of channel constraint significantly impacts the quality and quantity of habitat for aquatic organisms, as well as the type and degree of stream channel adjustment needed in response to alterations in flow and sediment supply or direct channel manipulations such as dredging, revetments, and impoundment. To assess overall reach channel constraint, this method modifies methods used by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in their Aquatic Inventories (Moore et al., 1993).

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a standardized approach for determining the extent of channel constraint within floodplains of western wadable streams, with the ultimate goal of preserving and improving aquatic habitats.

5. Constraints: This method requires accurate data on stream characteristics, including flow rates, sediment supply, and human activities impacting the stream. The success of this method also depends on the ability to accurately assess channel constraint in the field, which may require specialized training and equipment.
