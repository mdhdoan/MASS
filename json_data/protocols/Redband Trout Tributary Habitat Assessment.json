  "background": "The construction of Grand Coulee Dam in 1939blockedmigration routes for anadromous life histories of aquatic species- fragmenting populations and habitats in the upper Columbia River basin. Identification of habitat parameters that limit wild Redband Trout populations and their life history strategies have not been completed for many tributaries within the Spokane and upper Columbia subbasins.This protocol evaluates spawning and rearing habitats of Redband Trout in these watersheds. Habitat assessments will allow managers to better understand Redband Trout population characteristics and life histories, as well as identify habitat factors limiting populations. Information generated from this assessment will then be used to identify and prioritize habitats in need of restoration to protect and restore Redband Trout populations. Methodologies used will be dependent on the limitations of data that can be collected within specific watersheds.",
