2. Abstract: This method describes the use of radio telemetry tags and receivers to passively track animals over large geographic regions. The equipment used in this method is produced by Lotek, a Canadian company specializing in radio telemetry products. This method has been extensively used for monitoring returning adult salmon in the Snake River basin, with receivers set up at fixed locations or used from an automobile, boat, or plane to cover larger areas. The use of this technology allows biologists to gather critical data on animal movements without requiring permanent infrastructure or causing disturbance to the animals.

3. Description: Radio telemetry tags and receivers are a non-invasive method for tracking animals over large geographic regions. This method involves attaching radio transmitters, also known as tags, to animals and using receivers to detect the signals emitted by these tags. The text describes how this technology has been used specifically for monitoring returning adult salmon in the Snake River basin. When used for salmon, receivers can be set up at fixed locations with multiple antennas facing different directions or used from a moving vehicle such as a boat or plane to cover larger areas. Lotek is a Canadian company that specializes in radio telemetry products and produces both the tags and receivers described in this method. The equipment has been extensively used throughout the Snake River basin and is currently being used by several agencies.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a non-invasive means of tracking animals over large geographic regions, specifically for monitoring returning adult salmon in the Snake River basin.

5. Constraints: One constraint of this method is that it requires the use of specialized equipment produced by Lotek or another radio telemetry company. Additionally, the tags used in this method require surgical implantation which may not be feasible for all species or populations. The text also notes that while receivers can be used from a moving vehicle to cover larger areas, this approach may not be suitable for all situations and could potentially result in missed detections if the receiver is not positioned correctly.
