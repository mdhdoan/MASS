  "description": "<p>Data will be collected to 1) Locate piscivorous waterbird colonies in the Columbia River basin, 2) Assess the distribution and size of piscivorous waterbird colonies in the Columbia River basin below the confluence with the Snake River, 3) Estimate size of piscivorous waterbird colonies in the Columbia River basin below the confluence with the Snake River, 3) calculate colony-specific predation rates of piscivorous waterbirds on juvenile salmonids in the Columbia River basin below the confluence with the Snake River, 4) Assess cumulative/system-wide predation impacts on juvenile salmonids by piscivorous colonial waterbirds in the Columbia River basin below the confluence with the Snake River.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTo complete the work elements identified in our 2021 BPA SOW, we need to conduct multiple boat- and ground-based surveys to accurately estimate peak colony size and to conduct PIT tag work at each colony.</p>\r\n",
