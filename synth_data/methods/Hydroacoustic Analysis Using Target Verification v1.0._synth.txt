2. Abstract: The purpose of this method is to effectively sample, enumerate, and locate fish in the limnetic zone of a lake using an HTI model 241 echosounder equipped with two 200 kHz transducers. This non-invasive technique utilizes hydroacoustics for detecting fish targets while acknowledging its limitation in species identification. To address this, gill nets are employed to confirm the species of the detected targets, following method 6751 guidelines.
3. Description: The text describes a specific methodology for sampling and identifying fish in the limnetic zone of Banks Lake. A HTI model 241 echosounder with two 200 kHz transducers is used to conduct sixteen transects in an elongated zigzag pattern. The first transducer, a 15-split beam transducer in vertical orientation, helps sample and locate fish vertically, while the second one, a 6 x 10 elliptical split-beam transducer in horizontal orientation, provides information about fish distribution horizontally. Although hydroacoustics is efficient in detecting fish targets, it cannot determine species; hence, gill nets are used to verify and identify the species of those detected targets. The methodology strictly adheres to method 6751 guidelines for accurate results.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to perform non-invasive fish sampling, enumeration, and location in the limnetic zone of a lake using hydroacoustics while confirming species identification through gill net verification.
5. Constraints: This method relies on accurate hydroacoustic data for detecting fish targets; however, it cannot inherently identify fish species based on these measurements. Therefore, additional methods (gill nets) must be used to confirm the species of detected targets. Adherence to method 6751 guidelines is necessary to ensure proper implementation and interpretation of results.
