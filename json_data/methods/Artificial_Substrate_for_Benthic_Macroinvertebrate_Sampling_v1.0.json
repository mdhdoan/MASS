  "abstractText": "In streams that lack productive riffle or run habitat, use the modified Hester-Dendy artificial substrates to obtain the semi-quantitative samples.Deployment of 4 multi-plate artificial substrates occurs at each sampling site. The colonization period lasts a minimum of 4 weeks and must not exceed 6 weeks. The advantages of artificial substrates, which include habitat standardization and macroinvertebrate productivity, seem to outweigh their disadvantages that include habitat artificiality and taxa selectivity.",
