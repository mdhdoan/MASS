 1. Keywords: Percent calculation, reach, dryfromthalweg depth profiles, data collection method, Method 7008.

2. Abstract: The text outlines a method for calculating the percentage of a river's reach that is classified as "dryfromthalweg" in relation to its depth profiles. This process is crucial for understanding and managing water resources. Method 7008 is recommended for collecting thalweg depth profiles, which are necessary for this calculation.

3. Description: The text focuses on the specific method used to calculate the percentage of a river's reach that is dryfromthalweg based on its depth profiles. This calculation requires accurate and consistent data collection, which Method 7008 provides. The thalweg depth profile is a significant aspect in determining the dry areas in a river's reach. By following this method, one can accurately assess the water availability and usage in a given river system.

4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to accurately determine the percentage of a river's reach that is dryfromthalweg based on its depth profiles, which will aid in efficient water resource management.

5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the availability and accuracy of data collected using Method 7008 for thalweg depth profiles, as well as the necessity of a clear definition and understanding of what constitutes "dryfromthalweg" in relation to a river's reach.
