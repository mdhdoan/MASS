 1. Abstract:
The text outlines a research project focused on the reconditioning and reproductive success evaluation of kelt steelhead in the Snake River Basin. The project aims to address the need for improved management strategies and productivity of B-run steelhead populations, as required by RPA 33 in the Federal Columbia River Power System Biological Opinion. The research involves the study of reconditioning processes, measurement of reproductive success of artificially reconditioned kelt steelhead, and investigation of rematuration rates.
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes:
Values: Preservation and sustainable management of steelhead populations in the Snake River Basin.
Problem Statement: Low productivity and population decline of B-run steelhead, requiring improved management strategies as per RPA 33.
Desired outcomes: Improved reconditioning processes, increased rematuration rates, and enhanced reproductive success of artificially reconditioned kelt steelhead.
3. Description:
The project includes the evaluation of long-term reconditioned kelt steelhead rematuration rates using physiological and endocrinological parameters as indicators. A relative reproductive success study will be conducted on artificially reconditioned kelt steelhead in the Yakima River, utilizing pedigree analysis. Additionally, the project aims to estimate the genetic stock structure of Snake River Basin kelt steelhead at Lower Granite Dam and explore alternative management strategies by comparing in-river survival of kelt steelhead against reconditioning strategies.
