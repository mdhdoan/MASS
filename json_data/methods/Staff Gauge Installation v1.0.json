  "abstractText": "A staff gage is a scale (usually enameled steel, marked in feet and tenths) placed in the stream to show the elevation of the water surface (Harrelson et. al. 1994:42). Thelocation of the gage depends upon its purpose: most essentiallywhere the user would like to record the river flow (Rantz and others 1982). Install a staff gage ... if the site will be monitored on a regular basis (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). If the site is remote or will be visited irregularly (1-5 year intervals or longer), a staff gage may not be worthwhile in terms of cost and visual impact (Harrelson et. al. 1994:42).",
