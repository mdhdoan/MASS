 1. Keywords: Hydroacoustic methods, fish populations, field calibration, split-beam transducers, intrusive devices.

2. Abstract: Hydroacoustic methods are used to estimate the abundance of migrating fish populations in situations where other methods are not practical, such as wide rivers or turbid waters. This approach is often preferred over more invasive techniques like nets and traps. The text specifically discusses field calibration for split-beam transducers, a key component of hydroacoustic systems, highlighting its importance in ensuring accurate and reliable assessments.

3. Description: The text focuses on the use of hydroacoustic methods for assessing fish populations, emphasizing their non-invasive nature compared to alternatives like nets or traps. These methods are particularly useful in challenging environments such as wide rivers or turbid waters. The text then delves into the specifics of field calibration for split-beam transducers, a crucial aspect of hydroacoustic systems. Proper calibration ensures accurate data collection and analysis, contributing to the reliability and effectiveness of these methods.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a non-invasive and reliable approach to estimating fish populations in challenging environments, utilizing field calibration for split-beam transducers to ensure accurate data collection and analysis.

5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need for suitable hydroacoustic equipment, trained personnel to operate and maintain the equipment, and appropriate environmental conditions for effective data collection (e.g., minimal interference from other sound sources). Additionally, the success of this method relies on accurate field calibration, which can be influenced by various factors such as transducer placement, water temperature, and salinity.
