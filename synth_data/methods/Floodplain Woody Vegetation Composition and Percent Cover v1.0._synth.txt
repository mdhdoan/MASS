2. Abstract: This method involves monitoring the composition and percent cover of woody vegetation in floodplains to evaluate the success of restoration efforts. By tracking the establishment of riparian vegetation communities over time, this method helps inform maintenance needs such as weed management. The data collected can also support the development of measurable canopy cover from young woody species within approximately 5 years after implementation.
3. Description: The method focuses on documenting woody vegetation cover in restoration project areas to assess the progression of cover types toward the desired condition. This is achieved through both active revegetation, which involves planting containerized trees and shrubs, and natural recruitment of native woody species. Monitoring the establishment of young woody species allows for the measurement of canopy cover development over time. Coordination with cover type mapping can further enhance the data collected using this method.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to evaluate the success of floodplain restoration efforts by monitoring woody vegetation composition and percent cover.
5. Constraints: This method requires regular access to established plot locations within the floodplain for data collection. Additionally, accurate identification of woody vegetation species and their corresponding cover may present a challenge, requiring expert knowledge or specialized training.
