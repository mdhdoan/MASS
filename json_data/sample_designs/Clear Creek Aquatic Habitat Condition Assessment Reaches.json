  "description": "<div>The objective of the Aquatic Habitat Condition Assessment and Fish Population Monitoring&nbsp;project is to provide an inventory of habitat conditions, establish a baseline for impact analyses,&nbsp;and to document fish distribution and relative abundance in the Clear Creek watershed on the Nez&nbsp;Perce-Clearwater National Forest near Kooskia, Idaho. Results from the assessment will serve as&nbsp;a reference point for comparison with future surveys to evaluate habitat conditions and processes,&nbsp;water quality parameters, and population changes over time as a result of resource management in&nbsp;the basin. Of particular importance is the current spatial distribution and relative abundance of</div>\r\n\r\n<div>salmonid species in the basin. The location of quality habitat for steelhead and salmon spawning&nbsp;and rearing, the overall importance of the drainage for these species, and the existence of&nbsp;upstream barriers will inform resource management decisions within the watershed.</div>\r\n",
