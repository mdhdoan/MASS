2. Abstract: This text describes a method to estimate fish abundance using redd counts and a correction factor. Redd counts are an important tool for estimating the number of adult fish in a spawning area when direct observation is not feasible. A correction factor, which represents the average number of fish per redd, must be determined to obtain an accurate estimate of fish abundance. This method discusses various approaches to determining the correction factor and its application in different geographical locations such as Oregon, Washington, California, and Montana. The text also highlights the importance of considering factors like life history variation, bias, and imprecision in redd counts for improving fish abundance estimates.
3. Description: The text emphasizes the significance of indirect observations, specifically redd counts, to estimate fish abundance, especially when direct observation is impractical. To calculate fish abundance using redd counts, a correction factor (fish per redd) must be established through an unbiased spawner abundance estimate taken downstream of a spawning reach. The text then discusses different techniques for enumerating adults and calculating the correction factor in various regions such as Oregon, Washington, California, and Montana.

In Oregon, steelhead redd counts are significantly correlated with adult escapement, with an average of 1.54 females per redd (Susac and Jacobs 2002). In Washington, cumulative redd counts are expanded by a factor of 2.5 fish per redd to estimate escapement. Gallagher (2005) found that using one value for all streams to convert redd counts to fish numbers appeared reliable for steelhead and coho salmon in California. However, Dunham et al. (2001) discovered considerable spatial and interannual variation in bull trout spawner-to-redd ratios, attributing it to life history variation or bias in redd counts. Al-Chokhachy et al. (2005) estimated an average of 2.68 bull trout spawners per redd, accounting for differences in life history forms.

The text also suggests that mark-recapture escapement estimates combined with improved field and laboratory methods for redd count surveys can enhance the accuracy of fish per redd metrics. The Bland-Altman method (Glantz 1997) is mentioned as a statistical procedure to assess the transferability of redd counts in estimating escapement across years and streams.

1. Target: Developing accurate fish abundance estimates based on redd counts and correction factors.
2. Constraints: The text suggests that further evaluation is needed to ensure the transferability of these estimates among different years, streams, and species. Additionally, accounting for various life history forms and improving field and laboratory methods for redd count surveys are highlighted as essential for accurate fish abundance estimates.
