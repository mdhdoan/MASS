  "background": "Volitional release is advocated as part of a natural rearing strategy for spring Chinook salmon and other anadromous species. We describe and compare the short-term benefits (survival to Lower Granite Dam), if any, and differences in arrival timing at Lower Granite Dam between volitional release and forceout. We also describe differences in travel time to Lower Granite Dam.",
