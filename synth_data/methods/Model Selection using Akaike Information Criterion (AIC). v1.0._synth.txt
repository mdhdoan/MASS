2. Abstract: Model selection using AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) is a widely adopted method for evaluating the information content of different competitive models. This technique, originating from Burnham and Anderson (2002), offers users the flexibility to determine the number of models for comparison. Its use enhances decision-making by providing an objective basis for selecting the most suitable model for a given dataset.
3. Description: The text discusses model selection using AIC, a technique distilled from Burnham and Anderson's work in 2002. This method requires users to customize the number of models for comparison, allowing them to assess the information content of various competing models. By applying this approach, decision-makers can choose the most appropriate model based on objective criteria rather than subjective judgment.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to facilitate informed model selection by offering an objective basis for comparing different competitive models.
5. Constraints: This method's main constraint lies in the user's responsibility to customize and specify the number of models to be compared, which may impact the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained.
