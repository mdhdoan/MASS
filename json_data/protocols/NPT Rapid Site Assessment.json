  "background": "A fundamental understanding of in-channel habitat condition is important for restoration practitioners engaged in assessments of factors limiting salmonid production, prioritization of protection and restoration activities, and coarse-scale evaluations of pre and post implementation conditions. To assist practitioners who would like low resolution assessments across broad spatial scales, or lack resources for intensive habitat status and effectiveness monitoring surveys, this protocol guides collection of datasets addressing channel unit composition, substrate, undercut banks, large woody debris, entrenchment and incision.",
