2. Abstract: This method describes the daily fish handling procedures for identifying and enumerating fish, recording marks, tags, and mortalities in the Upper Columbia River Basin. The use of passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags within the Upper Columbia Monitoring Strategy is emphasized, following specific protocols outlined in A Field Manual of Scientific Protocols (Terraqua 2008). This method also introduces a sampling technique for smolts using group counts instead of individual measurements.
3. Description: The text details the daily fish handling procedures for wild salmonids in the Upper Columbia River Basin, focusing on the identification and enumeration of fish, recording marks, tags, and mortalities. It highlights the importance of adhering to protocols outlined in A Field Manual of Scientific Protocols (Terraqua 2008) for PIT tagging. The method introduces an alternative approach for smolt sampling by using group counts instead of measuring individual fish, providing a more efficient means of data collection.
4. Target: To establish and implement standardized daily fish handling procedures, focusing on the use of PIT tags and group counting for smolt sampling in the Upper Columbia River Basin.
5. Constraints: The primary constraint for this method is ensuring the availability and proper functioning of PIT tags and related equipment. Additional constraints include adhering to specific protocols outlined in A Field Manual of Scientific Protocols (Terraqua 2008) and training staff on correct fish handling procedures, particularly when using group counting methods for smolt sampling.
