 1. Keywords: (a) Data Collection, (b) MS Access Database, (c) Summary Statistics, (d) Fish Passage Projects, (e) Habitat Conditions.
2. Abstract: The text describes a method for evaluating fish passage projects using data collected in the field and stored in an MS Access database. By computing summary statistics on variables such as juvenile fish density, spawner density, and redd density, researchers can gain insights into habitat conditions at the reach scale. This approach allows for more informed decision-making in managing fish populations and their habitats.
3. Description: The method described in the text involves collecting field data on fish passage projects and storing this data in an MS Access database. Summary statistics are then computed to reflect habitat conditions at the reach scale. These summary statistics were selected based on their high signal-to-noise ratios compared to other potential variables. The following variables are reported for Fish Passage Projects: Reach Length, Reach Width, GPS Coordinates, Sample Date, Juvenile Fish Density, Spawner Density, Redd Density, and Fish Passage Design. These variables were developed as part of the EPA EMAP program and are used to assess fish passage projects and their impact on habitat conditions.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to evaluate fish passage projects by analyzing summary statistics related to habitat conditions at the reach scale.
5. Constraints: One constraint of this method may be the availability and quality of field data collected on fish passage projects. Additionally, the selection of appropriate summary statistics requires a strong understanding of the signal-to-noise ratios of various potential variables.
