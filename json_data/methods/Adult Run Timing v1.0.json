  "abstractText": "Adult run timing is an important metric for evaluating salmonid diversity. Run timing of adults is a form of temporal diversity that allows fishto potentially use various freshwater environments. For example, spring Chinook salmon return at a time of year when stream flows are generally high, giving them access to upper watersheds, where they use habitat that later returning Chinook salmon cannot access.. Temporal diversity may also increase a populations resiliency to stochastic environmental events. Temporal diversity may also increase the genetic diversity of a population, potentially increasing a population's ability to adapt to environmental change (McElhany et al. 2000).Understanding the temporal structure of a population is also important for fisheries management. In watersheds where hatchery stocks are used for harvest augmentation, understanding the difference between natural- and hatchery-origin run and spawn timing allows managers to maintain separation between natural- and hatchery-origin fish, allowing for potential protection of natural-origin fish.",
