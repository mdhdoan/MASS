2. Abstract: This method describes how to determine the nutrient status of a waterbody, using Lake Wenatchee, Washington as an example. By evaluating the levels of Total Nitrogen (TN), Total Phosphorus (TP), Calcium, Alkalinity, and Chlorophyll a, the health and productivity of the lake can be assessed. This information is crucial for understanding the ability of the lake to support microorganisms, which form the base of the food web supporting higher organisms such as Sockeye salmon.
3. Description: The text outlines a method for evaluating the nutrient status of a waterbody, specifically focusing on Lake Wenatchee in Washington state. Five key parameters are measured to assess the lake's health and productivity: Total Nitrogen (TN), Total Phosphorus (TP), Calcium, Alkalinity, and Chlorophyll a. Monitoring these nutrients helps determine the lake's ability to support microorganisms, which are essential for the growth and survival of Sockeye salmon and other organisms in the food web.
4. Target: The primary focus is to provide a method for evaluating the nutrient status of waterbodies to understand their health and productivity.
5. Constraints: Potential constraints include limited access to testing equipment or resources, difficulty in obtaining samples from certain locations, and variability in weather conditions that may affect sampling and analysis. Additionally, the accuracy of results may be influenced by the expertise of those conducting the tests and interpreting the data.
