2. Abstract:
Vertical stage measurements are crucial for monitoring water levels in various applications. Staff gauges, which are graduated in 0.01 feet increments, are commonly used to obtain these measurements. By referencing staff gauges to a known elevation, stage measurements can be converted to an elevation, allowing for the replacement of damaged or destroyed staff gauges. This method ensures consistent and accurate water level monitoring, even when equipment is lost or destroyed.

3. Description:
Vertical stage measurements are obtained from physically mounted staff gauges, which serve as a reference point for measuring water levels. Most staff gauges have graduations in 0.01 feet increments, allowing for precise measurement of water levels. To ensure accurate conversion to an elevation, it is essential that staff gauges are referenced to a known elevation. This reference allows for the conversion of stage measurements to an elevation, facilitating comparison and analysis across different locations or time periods. In case of damage or destruction of existing staff gauges, having a known elevation reference enables the replacement of lost equipment while maintaining consistency in water level monitoring.

4. Target:
The target of this method is to establish accurate and consistent vertical stage measurements using staff gaues, referenced to a known elevation, for precise conversion to an elevation.

5. Constraints:
The main constraint of this method is the reliance on physical equipment (staff gauges), which can be damaged or destroyed. However, having a known elevation reference allows for accurate replacement and continuity in water level monitoring.
