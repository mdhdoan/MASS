 Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize and label the text you provided. Here are the five keywords that I think best represent the main topics and themes covered:

1. Rotary screw traps (RST)
2. Sub-sampling procedure
3. Fish migration
4. Mark-recapture data
5. Bypass door and PIT tag antenna

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract: The text describes a method for using rotary screw traps (RST) to collect fish for mark-recapture data during hatchery fish releases, while also ensuring the health of the fish by implementing sub-sampling procedures during periods of high catch. A modified trap box with a partition and bypass door is used to separate and release some of the captured fish back into the river without excessive handling. This proactive or reactive approach allows for estimates of bypassed individuals for each species, run, and rear present in the sub-sample, while also ensuring that the traps can remain operational during concurrent hatchery releases.
3. Description: The text explains the need for rotary screw traps (RST) to remain operational during hatchery fish releases in order to collect mark-recapture data, which is necessary for estimating the abundance of natural fish populations. However, during periods of high catch, it may be impractical or harmful to handle all of the captured fish. To address this challenge, a sub-sampling procedure using a modified trap box with a partition and bypass door is implemented. The partition separates the front quarter of the trap box from the back, and the sliding door can be opened to allow fish to move into the back with the current or closed to keep captured fish in the front section. Adjacent to the partition door on the right side wall is a bypass door with a PIT tag antenna that allows captured fish to move through a short tube and be passively interrogated for recaptures. All bypassed fish are then returned to the river without being excessively handled. This approach allows for estimates of bypassed individuals for each species, run, and rear present in the sub-sample, while ensuring that the traps can remain operational during concurrent hatchery releases and maximizing fish health.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to collect mark-recapture data from natural fish populations during hatchery fish releases while also ensuring the health of the fish by implementing sub-sampling procedures during periods of high catch.
5. Constraints: The main constraint of this method is the need for rotary screw traps (RST) to remain operational during concurrent hatchery releases, which can result in overwhelming numbers of trapped fish or density-related health problems if not managed properly. The sub-sampling procedure using a modified trap box with a partition and bypass door addresses these constraints by allowing some captured fish to be released back into the river without excessive handling, while still providing estimates of bypassed individuals for each species, run, and rear present in the sub-sample.
