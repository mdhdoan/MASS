2. Abstract:
This method focuses on collecting hourly water temperature data to analyze and understand the thermal regimes of rivers. By monitoring temperature magnitude, variability, frequency, duration, and timing, this approach helps assess the river's status and trends in temperature metrics critical for salmon growth and survival. This information is essential for managing and protecting aquatic ecosystems and promoting healthy salmon populations.

3. Description:
The text describes a method aimed at characterizing the thermal regime of rivers through the collection of hourly water temperature data. The main goal is to gather enough data to evaluate temperature metrics that impact salmon growth and survival. This information is necessary for understanding river health and identifying any changes in temperature patterns over time. By monitoring these trends, resource managers can make informed decisions to protect aquatic ecosystems and maintain viable salmon populations.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to assess the thermal regime of rivers and its impact on salmon growth and survival through hourly water temperature data collection and analysis.

5. Constraints:
Possible constraints for this method include limited access to river sites, resource availability, potential measurement errors due to environmental factors, and the need for regular data collection and maintenance. Additionally, interpreting and applying the findings may require collaboration with experts in aquatic ecology and fisheries management.
