2. Abstract: A staff gage is a device used to measure the elevation of the water surface in a stream or river. Its placement depends on the purpose of monitoring river flow. Regularly monitored sites benefit from staff gages, while remote or irregularly visited sites may find them impractical due to cost and visual impact concerns.
3. Description: Staff gages are enameled steel scales typically marked in feet and tenths, placed in a stream to show the elevation of the water surface. The location of the gage is crucial, depending on its intended purpose, which primarily revolves around recording river flow at a desired site (Rantz and others 1982). Regularly monitored sites, such as those requiring daily, weekly, or monthly checks, should install staff gages to facilitate accurate and consistent measurements. However, for remote locations or sites that are visited less frequently (at intervals of 1-5 years or longer), the cost and visual impact of a staff gage may not justify its use (Harrelson et al. 1994:42).
4. Target: The primary goal of using a staff gage is to accurately measure water surface elevation for river flow monitoring purposes, with an emphasis on practicality in terms of cost and visual impact.
5. Constraints: Staff gages may not be the best solution for remote or irregularly visited sites due to their cost and potential negative impact on the surroundings.
