2. Abstract: The Columbia River Basin is facing a significant decline in anadromous salmonid populations, with several being listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). A comprehensive monitoring strategy is required to address the uncertainties surrounding these declines and to develop effective recovery plans. This method proposes continuous monitoring of seven essential water quality attributes at specific integrator sites downstream from each population or subpopulation. By adhering to strict data quality guidelines, this strategy enables researchers to assess the impact of stream flow on water quality attributes, ensuring accurate evaluations necessary for ESA assessments and recovery planning.
3. Description: The text describes a detailed method for monitoring anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin, focusing on seven critical water quality attributes (temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorous). These attributes are continuously monitored at integrator sites located downstream from each population or subpopulation. The method recommends following manufacturers' guidelines for deployment and calibration of monitoring equipment, which should be co-located with flow gauges operated by the USGS or WDOE. This setup allows investigators to evaluate stream flow effects on water quality attributes. Data collected from current and historical monitoring programs may not be adequate or reliable for ESA assessments; therefore, this method emphasizes adhering to strict data quality guidelines (Data Quality Level A as defined by the Oregon Watershed Plan Water Quality Monitoring Technical Guidebook). The ESA requires assessments at various spatial scalesâ€”specific reaches, subpopulations, populations, and ESUs. This monitoring strategy aims to provide reliable information required for these assessments, ensuring effective recovery planning for endangered anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin.
4. Target: Developing a comprehensive water quality monitoring strategy for anadromous salmonid populations in the Columbia River Basin, addressing ESA assessment requirements and recovery planning needs.
5. Constraints: The primary constraints for this method include resource availability (financial, personnel, and equipment) for implementing continuous monitoring at integrator sites and ensuring adherence to strict data quality guidelines. Additionally, coordinating efforts between various organizations responsible for flow gauges and water quality monitoring stations is crucial for the success of this strategy.
