  "abstract": " In order to effectively manage and conserve steelhead populations in the Lower Snake River Major Population Group, particularly those in unsampled tributaries of Asotin Creek and Tucannon River, it is necessary to gather important information on adult abundance, distribution, and the proportion of hatchery origin fish. This can be achieved through the use of adult trapping and tissue sampling.\n\nAdult trapping involves installing, maintaining, and operating traps in tributaries to successfully enumerate migrating adult steelhead. These traps are designed to ensure that adult steelhead cannot ascend the stream without being counted or accurately estimated using mark-recapture techniques. Marks and tags on the fish will also not be missed during recapture. This information is crucial as it helps establish population abundance baselines for Asotin and Tucannon steelhead, measure progress towards meeting Endangered Species Act recovery goals, and identify genetic differences between populations.\n\nFurthermore, collecting tissue samples from adult steelhead will provide valuable insights into their genetic makeup through DNA and SNPs analyses. This information can help compare steelhead from these small tributaries with the core Asotin and Tucannon populations, contributing to the genetic characterization of Snake River Basin steelhead.\n\nThe necessity of this method lies in the uncertainties surrounding adult steelhead abundance and distribution in unsampled tributaries, their biological association with core steelhead populations, and the proportion of hatchery origin fish within these populations. Gathering this information is not feasible during spawning surveys but can be achieved through adult trapping.\n\nWithout the proposed adult abundance information, it is impossible to accurately assess the population status or progress towards recovery goals for Asotin and Tucannon steelhead, which contradicts the priorities of Viable Salmonid Population monitoring under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The use of adult trapping and tissue sampling addresses these issues by providing crucial data that is not obtainable through other methods."

  "value": " Investing in the proposed project to estimate adult steelhead abundance, distribution, and the proportion of hatchery origin fish in tributaries, as well as collect tissue samples from adult steelhead, will provide valuable information for effective conservation and recovery efforts of Asotin and Tucannon steelhead populations. Here's why this investment is important:\n\n1. **Understanding Steelhead Abundance and Distribution:** The project will help establish population abundance baselines for Asotin and Tucannon steelhead, allowing us to measure progress towards meeting Endangered Species Act recovery goals. This information is crucial for understanding the status of these populations and prioritizing conservation efforts.\n\n2. **Identifying Hatchery Origin Fish:** By determining the proportion of hatchery origin fish in these populations, we can better understand how hatchery programs are contributing to the overall population dynamics. This knowledge will help guide management decisions regarding hatchery operations, stocking strategies, and wild fish conservation efforts.\n\n3. **Genetic Characterization:** The collection of tissue samples for DNA and SNP analyses will contribute to the genetic characterization of Snake River Basin steelhead. This information is essential for understanding the genetic diversity and connectivity within these populations and can help inform conservation strategies.\n\n4. **Effective Conservation and Recovery:** With this data, we can make more informed decisions regarding habitat restoration, management practices, and hatchery operations to support the recovery of these steelhead populations. This investment will ultimately contribute to the long-term sustainability and resilience of these important fish populations.\n\nRegarding the potential values:\n\n1. **Adult Steelhead Abundance:** Estimating adult steelhead abundance in unsampled tributaries will help determine the overall health and size of the Asotin and Tucannon populations. This information is necessary for effective conservation planning.\n\n2. **Proportion of Hatchery Origin Fish:** Determining the proportion of hatchery origin fish within these populations will inform management decisions and support wild fish conservation efforts.\n\n3. **Genetic Characterization:** The collection of tissue samples for genetic analysis will provide crucial information on the genetic diversity, connectivity, and potential impacts of hatchery programs on these steelhead populations.\n\n4. **Costs:** The costs involved in this project include funding for adult traps, maintenance and operation, tissue sample collection, and DNA/SNP analyses. These costs will vary depending on the specifics of each component but should be considered a worthwhile investment for the valuable information gained from the project."

  "problem_statement": " The text describes a project aimed at gathering information on adult steelhead abundance, distribution, and the proportion of hatchery origin fish in small, unsampled tributaries that are part of the Asotin and Tucannon populations within the Lower Snake River Major Population Group (MPG). The project goals include installing and operating adult traps to successfully enumerate migrating adult steelhead, collecting tissue samples from unmarked steelhead for DNA analysis, and comparing the genetic makeup of steelhead from these small tributaries with the core Asotin and Tucannon populations.\n\nThe main problem the protocol is trying to solve is the uncertainty regarding the abundance and distribution of adult steelhead in unsampled tributaries, as well as the proportion of hatchery origin fish within each population. This information is crucial for determining population abundance baselines, measuring progress towards Endangered Species Act recovery, and contributing to genetic characterization efforts for Snake River Basin steelhead.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, the project proposes installing and operating adult traps on at least two small tributaries per year, taking tissue samples from 30-100 unmarked steelhead per site/stream, and analyzing DNA and SNPs from these samples as part of an existing genetics database. This data will be used to compare the genetic makeup of steelhead from these small tributaries with the core Asotin and Tucannon populations."
}{
  "desired_outcomes": " The desired outcomes stated in the protocol are:\n\n1. To establish upstream migrant traps on at least two mSA tributaries per year and rotate them from stream to stream every three years to estimate adult steelhead abundance in unsampled tributaries.\n2. To tissue sample 30-100 unmarked steelhead per trap site/stream for DNA and SNPs analyses, which will be run as part of the Snake River genetics database.\n3. To contribute to genetic characterization of Snake River Basin steelhead by comparing steelhead from these small tributaries with the core Asotin and Tucannon populations using existing funding (project 20102600).\n\nTherefore, the desired outcomes can be summarized as follows:\n\n* Estimate adult steelhead abundance, distribution, and proportion of hatchery origin fish in unsampled tributaries.\n* Collect tissue samples from adult steelhead for genetic analyses to compare populations."

  "description": " The text body discusses the steelhead populations in the Asotin and Tucannon areas within the Lower Snake River Major Population Group (MPG). These populations are of interest due to their distinct spawning aggregations (MSAs and mSAs), with Asotin having three major and three minor aggregations, while Tucannon has one major and four minor aggregations.\n\nTo gain a more comprehensive understanding of these steelhead populations, the proposed project aims to install and operate adult traps in select mSA tributaries each year. This will enable the successful enumeration of migrating adult steelhead (Objective 1), ensuring that no adults can ascend the stream without being counted and minimizing missed marks or tags during recapture.\n\nFurthermore, tissue samples will be collected from unmarked steelhead in these small tributaries to contribute to genetic characterization of Snake River Basin steelhead (Project 201002600) and compare them with the core Asotin and Tucannon populations. Approximately 30-100 tissue samples will be taken per trap site or stream, provided there is sufficient funding for DNA and SNPs analyses as part of the Snake River genetics database (Objective 2).\n\nThe primary goals of this project include determining adult abundance, distribution, and the proportion of hatchery origin fish within these tributaries. By gaining this information, researchers will be able to establish population abundance baselines for Asotin and Tucannon steelhead, measure progress towards Endangered Species Act (ESA) recovery, and assess the potential influence of hatchery fish on wild populations.\n\nDespite ongoing monitoring efforts in larger rivers and streams, uncertainty remains regarding the abundance and distribution of adult steelhead in unsampled tributaries, as well as their association with core steelhead populations and the proportion of hatchery spawners within these populations. Collecting this data through adult trapping is not feasible during traditional spawning surveys for steelhead, making it an essential part of Viables Salmonid Population monitoring for ESA recovery."
