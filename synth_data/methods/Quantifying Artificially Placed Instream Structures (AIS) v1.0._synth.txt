 1. Keywords: Tallying, Artificial Instream Structures (AIS), Large Woody Debris (LWD), rock structures, active channel.
2. Abstract: This method outlines a process for counting artificially-placed instream structures, known as AIS, including Large Woody Debris and rock structures. The tally is conducted on all AIS within the active, or bankfull, channel - the portion of the channel filled during moderate flood events. By accurately quantifying these structures, this method aids in understanding their impact on the river system and informing management decisions.
3. Description: This method focuses on the process of tallying Artificially-placed Instream Structures (AIS), which are categorized as Large Woody Debris (LWD) or rock structures. The counting encompasses all AIS located in the active, bankfull channel - defined as the channel filled by moderate flood events that typically occur every one and a half years. To ensure comprehensiveness, the tally includes AIS between channel cross-section Transects.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to accurately count all artificial instream structures within the active channel.
5. Constraints: This method requires a clear definition of what constitutes an AIS and the active channel, as well as accurate methods for identifying and counting these structures in the field. Time and resource constraints may also pose challenges in implementing this method, particularly in large river systems with numerous AIS.
