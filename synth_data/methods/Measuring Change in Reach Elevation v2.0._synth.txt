2. Abstract:
This method focuses on quantifying the change in elevation at the water's surface between the top and bottom boundaries of a stream reach. By calculating the vertical difference or drop between the water surface levels at these two points, one can determine the elevation change. Additionally, the gradient, defined as the percent slope at the water surface along the stream reach, provides valuable information about the incline of the channel. These measurements are crucial for understanding the topography and flow dynamics within a stream system, enabling better management and conservation efforts.

3. Description:
The objective of this method is to quantify the change in elevation at the water's surface between the top and bottom boundaries of a stream reach, also referred to as the Top of the Reach (TR) and Bottom of the Reach (BR). The elevation change is defined as the vertical difference or drop between the water surface levels at these two points.

Furthermore, the gradient is calculated as the percent slope at the water surface along the stream reach, which is obtained by dividing the elevation change by the reach length. These measurements are essential for understanding the topography and flow dynamics within a stream system, facilitating better management and conservation efforts.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to determine and analyze the elevation change and gradient in stream reaches, which contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of water flow dynamics and channel topography.

5. Constraints:
Constraints for this method may include accessibility to the stream reach for accurate measurements, potential variations in water levels due to weather conditions or human activities, and ensuring that the TR and BR are clearly defined and consistently measured throughout the study.
