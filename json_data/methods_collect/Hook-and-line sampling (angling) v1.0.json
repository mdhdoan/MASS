  "abstractText": "Hook-and-line sampling, or angling, is a means to collect fish when other methods may not be feasible due to ESA constraints, gear bias, and habitat limitations. It is also an effective method to target specific species and to minimize bycatch of non-target species. This type of sampling enables a researcher to be mobile, but it can be hard to define area sampled. In addition, success in sampling depends on fish behavior and the skill of the angler, making it difficult to standardize sampling efforts (Zale et al. 2012). Collected fish can be used to collect information about diet, size, weight, age, and habitat use among other things. Collected fish can also be used in tagging studies.Users of this method should possess a moderate knowledge of angling techniques. The specific portion of this method should be customized for different species and study objectives.",
