2. Abstract: The text outlines a method for identifying and counting side-channels in waded streams as part of the Status and Trends Program. This process involves observing only those sections of side channels that are adjacent to the sampled portion of the main channel, specifically between the top and bottom of the reach. By following this method, program participants can maintain consistency and accuracy in their data collection efforts.
3. Description: The method discussed here aims to provide clear instructions for identifying and counting side-channels within waded streams, which is crucial for the Status and Trends Program's data collection process. This method restricts observations to portions of side channels adjacent to the sampled part of the main channel, specifically between TransectA0 (at the top of the reach) and Transect K0 (at the bottom of the reach). By following these guidelines, program participants can ensure uniformity in data collection and analysis.
4. Target: The primary focus is to establish a consistent method for identifying and counting side-channels within waded streams for the Status and Trends Program.
5. Constraints: This method constrains observations of side-channels to specific sections along the main channel, which are located above TransectA0 and below Transect K0. This ensures that data collection remains standardized and relevant to the program's objectives.
