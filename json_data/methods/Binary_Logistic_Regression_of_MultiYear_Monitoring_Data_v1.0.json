  "abstractText": "Background:As in linear regression, the goal of logistic regression is to determine whether a relationship exists between independent, explanatory variables and dependent response variables and, if so, to define that relationship mathematically in order to make predictions. Unlike linear regression, the response variable in logistic regression is nominal, and in binary logistic regression it is restricted to two categories (e.g., alive/dead, yes/no, presence/absence). Binary logistic regression attempts to predict the probability of obtaining one of these two categories, given values for one or multiple independent variables. The results of binary logistic regression may therefore be expressed in terms of the odds of observing one of the two possible results, given a particular set of independent variables.Researchers in a broad range of fields measure responses in terms of a binary result. Independent variables may be either categorical or continuous. If more than one independent variable is measured, then multiple logistic regression is applied to generate results. In restoration ecology, this analysis strategy can be applied to data collected from monitoring programs that have measured binary responses. For example, different irrigation treatments may be applied in order to determine how varying levels of water influence plant survival. Since trees are measured as either dead or alive under each treatment, these response data are binary. Binary logistic regression can then be used to predict the probability of plant survival given a certain level of irrigation.The analysis method below assumes that multiple independent variables, both categorical and continuous, have been measured over multiple years in relation to binary response variables as part of a restoration experiment. As such, binary logistic regression with multiple independent variables is applied in order to determine the odds of, in this case, tree survival and presence of browse.The method below also accounts forone independent variable, median plant height, that was not associated with a binary outcome. This variable was analyzed separately with a different test in order to determine whether median plant height was statistically significantly different between restoration treatments.",
