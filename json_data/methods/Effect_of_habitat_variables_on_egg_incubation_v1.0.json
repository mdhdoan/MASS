  "abstractText": "Many techniques to assess egg-to-fry survival involve a multitude of sub-estimators that can confound any direct effects by compounding the variances of each individual sub-estimate. Therefore, a direct measurement from egg to pre-emergent or emergent fry stage is often a better estimator. Habitat measurements that are collected at egg box sites can be used to form a model explains survival.",
