2. Abstract: The Columbia Habitat and Monitoring Program (CHaMP) utilizes the Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) survey design to measure key habitat metrics at specific sites within CHaMP watersheds. This method provides estimates for population mean, median, standard deviation, and three-year trend, along with confidence bounds and standard error for each metric. Moreover, the approach offers insights into the components of variance within each watershed, addressing measurement noise, year-to-year variation, and stratum-stratum variation.
3. Description: The Columbia Habitat and Monitoring Program (CHaMP) employs a systematic method to evaluate key habitat metrics at designated sites within CHaMP watersheds using the Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) survey design. Metrics estimates include population mean, median, standard deviation, and three-year trend, accompanied by standard error and 95% confidence bounds for the mean and trend estimates. These estimates are calculated for both the entire CHaMP population and within each watershed. Furthermore, the method delivers model-based estimates of the components of variance within each watershed, shedding light on the relative magnitude of measurement noise, year-to-year variation, watershed-watershed variation, stratum-stratum variation, and site-site variation in every stratum/watershed combination.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to offer a comprehensive assessment of key habitat metrics within the CHaMP watersheds while providing valuable insights into the components of variance for each metric across different temporal and spatial scales.
5. Constraints: A potential constraint for this method might be the availability and accessibility of data, as it relies on consistent monitoring and measurement of various habitat metrics at selected sites within the CHaMP watersheds. Additionally, computational resources and expertise may also pose limitations when calculating complex model-based estimates for the components of variance.
