2. Abstract: This method outlines the importance of monitoring and assessing road density and watershed disturbance within watersheds using remote sensing and GIS techniques. By calculating road density and the riparian-road index, this approach provides a quantifiable measure of road impacts on watersheds, which will be updated every five years. Additionally, land ownership and land use are mapped to indicate watershed disturbance, offering valuable information for management and conservation efforts.
3. Description: The method focuses on two main aspects: road density and watershed disturbance. Road density is calculated by measuring the total length of roads within a watershed and dividing it by the area of the watershed using GIS. The riparian-road index, another aspect of road density, is determined by calculating the total kilometers of roads within riparian areas and dividing it by the total number of stream kilometers in the watershed. An example of this calculation can be found in WFC (1998) for the Umpqua Basin. These measures will be updated every five years using remote sensing techniques and available GIS layers. For watershed disturbance, land ownership and land use are mapped within each watershed that includes monitoring reaches or sites. This information is also updated every five years to ensure accurate representation of disturbance within the watersheds.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to establish a systematic approach for monitoring and assessing road density and watershed disturbance in watersheds, providing valuable data for management and conservation efforts.
5. Constraints: This method requires access to up-to-date remote sensing data and GIS layers, as well as the necessary software and expertise to analyze and interpret the data. Additionally, regular updates every five years necessitate consistent funding and resources to maintain the monitoring program.
