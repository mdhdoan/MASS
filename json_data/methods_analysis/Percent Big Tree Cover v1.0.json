Estimates are the percent of aerial cover (the amount of shadow that would be cast if the sun were directly overhead) from bigtrees (>0.3m DBH) in the canopy layer (>5mhigh). All the estimates site-wide are averaged to arrive at the percent big tree coverThe CHaMP - Riparian Structure Method provides background on the measurements that are analyzed for this calculation.
