2. Abstract:
This text describes a long-term Bonneville Power Administration-funded research project aimed at understanding the coastal ecosystems and biological and physical processes influencing Pacific Northwest waters' recruitment variability of salmon. The study emphasizes examining the effects of biotic and abiotic environmental conditions on coho and Chinook salmon's early marine life history, particularly in the Columbia River Plume, an area with high salmonid abundance influenced by human activities. The research further investigates winter ichthyoplankton prey biomass and evaluates the relationship between changes in ichthyoplankton composition or fish larval prey community and salmon marine survival to understand better how different types of available fish may affect juvenile salmon's survival prospects.

3. Description:
This research project, supported by the Bonneville Power Administration, focuses on understanding coastal ecosystems and biological and physical processes that can influence recruitment variability of salmon in Pacific Northwest waters. Currently, researchers are examining the effects of biotic and abiotic environmental conditions on coho and Chinook salmon during their early marine life history. The Columbia River Plume is a primary research area due to its high abundance of salmonid fish and influence from anthropogenic factors. In addition to analyzing winter ichthyoplankton prey biomass, the study calculates annually how changes in ichthyoplankton composition or fish larval prey community may impact salmon marine survival. This approach expands the research beyond just looking at food availability (biomass) and considers whether the type of available fish affects juvenile salmon's chances of survival, contributing to a better understanding of factors influencing Pacific Northwest waters' recruitment variability in salmon.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to analyze and understand the influence of coastal ecosystems and environmental conditions on the recruitment variability of coho and Chinook salmon in Pacific Northwest waters, with a particular emphasis on the Columbia River Plume.

5. Constraints:
Possible constraints for this research may include limited access to specific data sources or funding limitations that impact the scope and duration of the study. Additionally, environmental complexities and variables influencing salmon recruitment may pose challenges in identifying definitive causal relationships and predicting outcomes accurately.
