2. Abstract: The necessity of understanding and quantifying streambed substrate has led to the development of the pebble count procedure. This method allows for the measurement of substrate without the need for laboratory analysis, making it a cost-effective and efficient solution. By taking measurements at intervals along main channel and side channels within bankfull constraints, this procedure provides valuable data on bed load transport, channel stability, and resistance to scour during high flow events. These factors are critical in maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems, as they impact fish spawning and other organisms that rely on the substrate for cover.

3. Description: The pebble count procedure is a method used to quantify streambed substrate by taking measurements at intervals along main channel and side channels within bankfull constraints. This procedure was originally designed to avoid the need for collecting substrate samples and taking them back to the lab for sieve analysis, making it a more efficient solution. The frequency of bed load transport is a key aspect measured in this procedure, as it can be critically important to fish spawning and other aquatic organisms that use the substrate for cover. Channel stability and resistance to scour during high flow events are also evaluated through this method, providing valuable information for maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems.

4. Target: The primary focus of the pebble count procedure is to quantify streambed substrate and provide data on bed load transport, channel stability, and resistance to scour during high flow events.

5. Constraints: The main constraint for this method is the need for accurate measurement of substrate at intervals along main channel and side channels within bankfull constraints. Additionally, the procedure requires a clear understanding of bed load transport and its impact on aquatic ecosystems.
