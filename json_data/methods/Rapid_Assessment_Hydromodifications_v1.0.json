  "abstractText": "Reach confinement due to hydromodifications is the extent that manmade structures within or adjacent to the stream channel constrict flow (such as bridges) or restrict flow access to the streams floodplain (due to streamside roads, revetments, diking or levees). It also refers to the extent that the channel has been ditched or channelized, or has undergone significant streambed degradation due to channel incision/entrenchment (associated with the process called headcutting). Flow access to the floodplain can be partially or wholly cut-off due to channel incision. Note: setback levees are to be treated differently than narrow-channel or riverfront levees-consider the extent of the setback and its effect on flow and bed dynamics and micro-habitat features along the stream margin in reach to arrive at rating conclusion. Reference condition for this attribute is the natural, undeveloped state.Examples of hydromodifications are: dikes, bridges, rip rap, broken up concrete on bank, tires on bank, rocks placed on bank, concrete on bank, wire/fencing to hold bank in place, cabling trees to hold bank in place, placing yard waste on bank, dredge spoils placed on bank, culverts, engineered structures (like weirs or bridge abutments, buildings, concrete pump housings or any other fabricated structures), roads, pipelines, excavation, other human activities right up to top of bank or in water course.",
