  "background": "Lake Pend Oreille once provided the largest kokanee fishery in the state of Idaho. Between 1952 and 1966, harvests of kokanee averaged 1 million kokanee/yr with up to 523,000 angler-hours of fishing pressure (Jeppson 1953; Maiolie and Elam 1993). Kokanee harvest dramatically declined after 1966, and by 1985 the annual harvest was only 71,200 kokanee with 179,000 angler hours (Bowles et al. 1987; Maiolie and Elam 1993). The extent and timing of winter lake drawdowns has been implicated as most detrimental effect on the population (Maiolie and Elam 1993), but by the early 2000s, high predation levels created by a rapidly expanding lake trout was the primary limiting factor for kokanee.Several recovery strategies are currently in place, including a lake trout reduction program, and wesurvey the kokanee population annually to evaluate the effectiveness of recovery actions. Estimates of kokanee abundance are completed using hydroacoustic sampling during late August and follow a stratified sampling design of zigzag transects, with 21 total transects sampled. A Simrad EK60 echosounder and 120 kHz split-beam transducer are used to conduct the mobile hydroacoustic survey; data are analyzed using echo integration techniques with Echoview software. Midwater trawl surveys are also conducted during the dark phase of the moon in August to collect physical kokanee samples. These samples are used to partition the hydroacoustic kokanee estimates into age classes and to obtain length and weight data. By combining data from the hydroacoustic and trawl surveys, we will calculate age class abundance, age-specific survival, biomass, production, and mortality by weight.",
