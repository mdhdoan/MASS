  "description": "<p>A multiple pass mark-recapture study is conducted to estimate abundance of Redband Trout in an index area of the Upper Spokane River. Redband Trout are captured by electrofishing using a drift boat mounted with a Smith-Root 2.5 GPP electrofishing unit.&nbsp; A crew of 2-3 individuals, one rower and 1-2 netters, conduct the electrofishing surveys. A total of three sampling passes are conducted during the survey. A sampling pass, or capture-recapture occasion, consists of sampling each shoreline of the sampling area. Electrofishing transects were established prior to the initial capture effort using a recreational grade handheld GPS. Two float trips are required to sample both shorelines during each pass. The initial sampling float starts on either the north or south shoreline and alternates&nbsp;to the opposite shoreline at intervals of approximately 600 seconds (500 m). The subsequent float begins on the opposite shoreline and alternates to the shoreline segments that were not sample&nbsp;on the previous float, ensuring that the entire shoreline iss sampled. This strategy is employed to avoid electrofishing over recently released Redband Trout. All float trips commence&nbsp;at least 0.5 hours after sunset and continue&nbsp;until all transects for that float are complete.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
