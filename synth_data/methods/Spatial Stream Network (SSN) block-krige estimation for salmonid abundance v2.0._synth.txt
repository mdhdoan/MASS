2. Abstract: This method introduces a broadly scalable approach to estimate fish population sizes using predictive mapping of fish densities. The high costs and limited extent of traditional sampling methods are addressed by leveraging large fish density datasets, SSN models, and national geospatial database frameworks for streams. The method uses universal kriging for continuous maps of juvenile salmonid densities and block kriging to summarize these maps for population estimates at larger scales. Reach covariates are incorporated to assess habitat factors affecting fish species distribution and density, with the SSN-BK population estimator implemented in the STARS and SSN software within the ArcGIS and R computing environments.
3. Description: The necessity for predictive mapping of fish densities and population size estimates for anadromous species is highlighted due to sampling costs limiting most estimates to small portions of river networks. The advent of large fish density datasets, SSN models benefiting from non-independence among samples, and national geospatial database frameworks provide the components for a scalable approach to estimating fish population sizes. Universal kriging is used to create continuous maps of juvenile salmonid densities, while block kriging is used to summarize these maps for population estimates at larger scales. Reach covariates are incorporated into SSN models to assess habitat factors affecting fish species distribution and density. The SSN-BK population estimator is implemented in the STARS and SSN software within the ArcGIS and R computing environments.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a scalable approach to estimate fish population sizes using predictive mapping of fish densities, by leveraging large fish density datasets, SSN models, and national geospatial database frameworks for streams.
5. Constraints: The main constraint for this method is the availability and quality of large fish density datasets, SSN models, and national geospatial database frameworks for streams, as well as the expertise required to implement and interpret the results using the STARS and SSN software within the ArcGIS and R computing environments.
