2. Abstract: This method outlines the importance of measuring water conductivity and alkalinity at the start of each site above the last transect flag to monitor for potential sediment disturbance. The measurements are taken in flowing water near the center of the channel to ensure accurate readings. In case a beaver dam pool exists at the top of the site, the water chemistry is measured downstream of the dam, even if it falls within the site boundary.
3. Description: The methodology emphasizes the need for monitoring conductivity and alkalinity levels in water bodies to identify any disturbances that may have been caused by sediment displacement during sampling or other activities. By measuring these parameters at the upstream end of each site above the last transect flag, researchers can determine if there has been any disruption to the local environment due to human interference. The measurement should be taken in flowing water near the center of the channel for optimal results. In case a beaver dam pool is present at the top of the site, it is crucial to measure water chemistry downstream of the dam, even if it falls within the site's boundaries. This step ensures that any impact from the beaver dam on water quality is captured and accounted for in the study.
4. Target: Monitoring and preventing sediment disturbance while conducting water quality measurements.
5. Constraints: The primary constraints of this method include the availability of suitable measurement equipment, expertise required to accurately interpret conductivity and alkalinity readings, and potential limitations when measuring in beaver dam pools or other challenging environments.
