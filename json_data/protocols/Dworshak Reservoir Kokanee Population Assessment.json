  "background": "An overall goal of the Dworshak Reservoir nutrient restoration project is to improve the efficiency of the foodweb, thereby increasing the size and abundance ofkokaneein the reservoir to benefit the sport fishery and other resident fishes. In order to assess the effects of nutrient restoration on the kokanee population, we examine a variety of metrics on an annual basis. We assess kokanee size, age structure and reproductive development using biological data obtained from mid-water trawl surveys conducted in July. Furthermore, we estimate age-specific abundance, survival rates, biomass, production and total mortality by weight. We will evaluate kokanee growth either through length back-calculations from scale analysis, additional trawl surveys conducted in the spring and fall, or a combination of the two. Each fall, we collect pre-spawn kokanee from index streams to evaluate size and fecundity. We conduct visual spawner counts for four index streams within three days of the historical peak of spawning activity.",
