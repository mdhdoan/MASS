  "abstract": " In order to understand the impact of Marine Derived Nutrients (MDN) replacement on salmonid food webs and natural production in a Methow basin stream, the Yakama Nation proposes a multi-year experimental study. The project aims to clarify the effects, benefits, and potential risks of MDN addition by adding nutrients into Hancock Springs, a juvenile rearing habitat.\n\nThe study design includes a robust 3-year pre-treatment phase, followed by annual nutrient treatments during the experimental phase. This approach will help isolate fine-scale effects and trophic cascading energy patterns from the nutrient additions. Additionally, the risks of MDN addition disrupting food web dynamics to favor invasive species such as brook trout will be assessed.\n\nThe research questions focus on how MDN replacement affects productivity and dynamics of salmonid food webs, natural production, and the growth, condition, and survival of juvenile salmonids in the freshwater rearing environment. The study also investigates whether MDN replacement could disrupt the trophic ecology of salmonid food webs to preferentially benefit non-target competitor or predator fish species.\n\nTo address these questions, the method includes:\n\n1. Electrofishing: Sampling events will capture fish populations across all individuals and size classes, ensuring consistency in catchability during each event. Sufficient numbers of fish will be PIT tagged and recaptured to estimate production. Growth rates of both tagged and untagged fish will be compared to ensure no difference.\n2. Fish Diets: Collected species' diets will represent the population at large, and isotopes from fin clips will provide insights into fish trophic positions.\n3. Monitoring equipment and sampling events: All equipment will function properly during each event, and annual changes will be captured accurately between March and December. Sites selected for sampling will represent the sample reach as a whole.\n\nThis comprehensive approach is necessary to address the concerns raised in recent studies regarding the impact of low nutrient levels on salmonid populations and food webs in the Upper Columbia River Basin. The results from this study could provide valuable insights into the potential benefits and risks of MDN addition, informing restoration efforts for ESA-listed anadromous salmonids in the region."

  "value": " Based on the text provided, the proposed research project aims to investigate the effects of Marine Derived Nutrients (MDN) replacement through carcass analogue addition on the productivity and dynamics of salmonid food webs, natural production, and the growth and condition of juvenile salmonids in a Methow basin stream, Hancock Springs. This study is important as it addresses concerns of low levels of natural production by Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed fish species throughout the Columbia Basin, which can impact Treaty-reserved tribal fisheries and potentially lead to extinction.\n\nThe potential values of investing in this project are:\n\n1. Improving our understanding of salmonid food webs and ecology: The proposed research aims to provide a broader and more ecologically informed context for restoration efforts by examining the role of MDN in aquatic productivity, particularly in low-nutrient, headwater streams. This can lead to improved management strategies for salmonid populations and their supporting ecosystems.\n2. Enhancing natural production: The study proposes a multiyear experimental MDN addition to clarify the empirical effects, benefits, and potential risks of MDN addition on juvenile salmonid food webs. This can potentially enhance natural production of anadromous salmonids and support the ecosystem's long-term health.\n3. Minimizing negative impacts: The study will assess the risk that MDN addition could produce deleterious effects by disrupting or altering food web dynamics to favor invasive, non-native species such as brook trout. By understanding potential risks, mitigation strategies can be developed to minimize negative impacts and support healthy ecosystems.\n4. Informing policy and management decisions: The research findings will provide valuable information for fishery co-managers, policymakers, and resource managers in the Columbia Basin region and beyond, helping to inform effective conservation and restoration efforts for salmonid populations and their supporting ecosystems.\n\nThere is no code provided as this request was focused on determining the potential values of investing in the proposed research project."

  "description": " In this study, the Yakama Nation proposes an experimental nutrient supplementation project to investigate the effects of marine derived nutrients (MDN) addition on juvenile salmonid food webs in a Methow basin stream, Hancock Springs. The primary objective is to examine how MDN replacement impacts productivity and dynamics of salmonid food webs, natural production, and the growth, condition, and survival of juvenile anadromous salmonids. Furthermore, potential risks associated with possible disruptions or alterations to food web dynamics for invasive, non-native species such as brook trout are evaluated.\n\nThe methodology of this research project includes a multiyear experimental design, starting with a robust 3-year pre-treatment phase, followed by MDN addition treatments during the subsequent years. The study will focus on isolating fine-scale effects and trophic cascading energy patterns from annual nutrient treatments to gain a better understanding of the ecological context and potential consequences for salmonid populations.\n\nThe research questions of this project include:\n1. How does MDN replacement (carcass analogue addition) affect the productivity and dynamics of salmonid food webs, natural production, and the growth, condition, and survival of juvenile salmonids in the freshwater rearing environment?\n2. Can MDN replacement disrupt the trophic ecology of salmonid food webs to preferentially benefit non-target competitor or predator fish species?\n\nTo address these questions, a combination of field sampling techniques and laboratory analyses will be employed:\n1. Electrofishing: Catchability of focal species (salmonids) is evaluated across all individuals at large and during all sample events. Sufficient numbers of fish can be PIT tagged and recaptured to estimate production, ensuring that growth rates for tagged and non-tagged fish are comparable.\n2. Fish Diets: The diets of collected species are analyzed to represent the population at large, while fin clips are used for isotopic analyses to assess the trophic position of individual fish within their food webs.\n3. Monitoring: Equipment functioning and consistency during each sampling event, accuracy in capturing annual changes, and selection of representative sites for sampling will be crucial components of this study design.\n\nAdditionally, potential risks associated with MDN addition to the ecosystem, such as disruptions or alterations to food web dynamics that could favor non-target species, will be assessed to ensure minimal negative impacts on the overall health and sustainability of the ecosystem."
