  "abstractText": "Freshwater fish have long been a focus of bioassessment activities (Klemm et al. 1993), and were the subject of the first attempts to develop multimetric indicators of ecological condition based on assemblage characteristics (Gammon 1980, Karr 1981, Karr et al. 1986, 1991). In particular fish assemblages offer several unique advantages to assess ecological condition from other biological assemblages, based on their mobility, longevity, and trophic relationships (Plafkin et al. 1989, Barbour et al. 1999). Other aquatic vertebrates, most notably amphibians, are important components of aquatic communities in many parts of the U.S. (Hairston 1987, Bury et al. 1991), and provide information regarding ecological condition in streams where fish are rare or absent (e.g., high-elevation streams, headwater streams, and streams above natural colonization barriers).The objective of this method is to collect a representative sample of all (except very rare) species in the assemblage. A sample from a single point does not provide an adequate representation of the vertebrate assemblage present. Therefore, sampling effort is allocated along the entire length of the support reach established at each sampling point. The length of the support reach (40 times the mean wetted width) is expected to allow collection of 90 percent of the species present based on several different studies (Patton et al. 2000, Cao et al. 2001, 2002, Reynolds et al. 2003).Fish, amphibians, and aquatic reptile species are sampled to estimate their proportionate abundances and the presence of external anomalies.  Backpack electrofishers are used as the principal sampling gear (Section 11.1.1.1). Bank or towed electrofishers are recommended for wide but shallow streams (Section 11.1.1.2), and seining (Section 11.1.1.3) is used in habitats where high conductivity or turbidity preclude electrofishing. In addition to gathering data on the assemblage, fish specimens are retained for analysis of tissue contaminants (Section 12). Data collected by these procedures are used to assess fish (or aquatic vertebrate) assemblage condition across the region of interest (e.g., McCormick et al. 2001, Hughes et al. 1998, 2004, Bramblett et al. 2005).What Data to Collect:1. Identify fish species.2. Photograph specimens.3. Collect voucher specimens.4. For fish: record total length (nose to distal end of caudal fin).  For amphibians: record body length (tip of the snout to the vent).5. Record external anomalies.6. Record total mortalities due to electrofishing or handling.7. Calculate a Jaccard Coefficient (JC) to assess sample adequacy.This method is conducted after all other field sampling and measurement activities are completed (if employing other EMAP methods) All team members are involved in collecting aquatic vertebrates.In addition, any crayfish specimens collected incidentally and are used to estimate the potential extent of nonnative crayfish in the western U.S.Changes to previously published EMAP procedures are summarized in Appendix B (McCormick and Hughes 1998).",
