2. Abstract:
This method involves estimating the percentage of the lineal distance between each transect that is actively eroding at the active channel height. Active erosion is defined as recently eroding or collapsing banks with characteristics such as exposed soils, tension cracks, active sloughing, or superficial vegetation that does not contribute to bank stability. This method is necessary for understanding the rate and extent of bank erosion in a particular area, which can help in formulating effective soil conservation strategies.
3. Description:
The text provides a detailed description of the method used for estimating the percentage of actively eroding areas along transects. The method involves identifying and measuring the lineal distance between each transect and then visually estimating the proportion of that distance that is actively eroding at the channel height. Active erosion is identified based on specific characteristics such as exposed soils, tension cracks, and superficial vegetation. The text also highlights the importance of bank stability in preventing active erosion and suggests that areas with unstable banks may require targeted interventions to prevent further degradation.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to estimate the percentage of actively eroding areas along transects, which can help in understanding the rate and extent of bank erosion.
5. Constraints:
One constraint for this method could be the subjectivity involved in visually estimating the proportion of the lineal distance that is actively eroding. Additionally, the accuracy of the estimates may depend on various factors such as the skill of the observer, weather conditions, and time of year. Another constraint could be the difficulty in identifying active erosion in areas with dense vegetation or complex topography.
