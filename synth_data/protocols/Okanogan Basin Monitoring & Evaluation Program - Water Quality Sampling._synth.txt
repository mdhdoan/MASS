1. Abstract:
The Okanogan Basin Monitoring and Evaluation Program (OBMEP) is a protocol developed to improve understanding of anadromous fish populations and habitat in the Okanogan River basin. The program focuses on water quality, quantity, and temperature, aiming to detect changes over time using methods similar to those used by the Department of Ecology. Water and temperature data are collected at designated sites to monitor the status and trends of water quality, and to determine potential impacts to salmonids in the basin.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes:
Values: The importance of understanding anadromous fish populations and habitat.
Problem Statement: Lack of comprehensive monitoring and evaluation of water quality, quantity, and temperature in the Okanogan River basin, leading to potential impacts on salmonids.
Desired outcomes: Improved water quality and conservation of salmonid populations in the Okanogan River basin.
3. Description:
The OBMEP is a monitoring protocol designed to detect changes in water quality, quantity, and temperature over time in the Okanogan River basin. The program selects data collection sites strategically to fill critical gaps, use existing historical data, and avoid duplication of effort. Water quality data are collected at all Okanogan River tributary EMAP sites located in the U.S. and Canada. The temperature data collection methodology is not specified in the text, but it is mentioned that temperature data are collected at all designated sites.
4. Objectives:
The objective of the OBMEP is to monitor the status and trends of water quality and determine potential impacts to salmonids in the Okanogan River Basin. This objective covers the entire problem statement by providing a comprehensive monitoring solution for water quality, quantity, and temperature.
Keywords: anadromous fish populations, habitat, water quality, water quantity, temperature, data collection sites, EMAP sites, salmonids, monitoring.
5. Target:
The primary focus of the OBMEP is to improve understanding of anadromous fish populations and habitat in the Okanogan River basin by monitoring water quality, quantity, and temperature changes over time.
6. Constraints:
The text does not mention any constraints for the current protocol. However, factors such as budget limitations, data collection challenges, and regulatory restrictions may impact the implementation of the OBMEP.
