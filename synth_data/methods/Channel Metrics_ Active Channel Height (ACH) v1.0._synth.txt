2. Abstract: The Active Channel Height (ACH) is a vital parameter in geomorphology and hydrology, representing the vertical distance from the average level of the streambed to the top of the active channel. This measurement helps assess flood risk, erosion control, and sediment transport, providing critical information for effective water resource management.
3. Description: The Active Channel Height (ACH) is defined as the vertical distance between the average level of the streambed and the top of the active channel. This measurement is crucial in understanding flood risks, evaluating erosion control strategies, and monitoring sediment transport within a waterbody. Obtaining accurate ACH values typically involves conducting a topographic survey to determine both the average streambed elevation and the topmost level of the active channel.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to accurately calculate and determine the Active Channel Height for effective water resource management, flood risk assessment, and erosion control strategies.
5. Constraints: The accuracy of ACH measurements depends on several factors, including the precision of the topographic survey methods used, changes in streambed elevation due to sediment deposition or erosion, and fluctuations in water levels that may affect the active channel's extent. Regular monitoring and updating of ACH values are essential for maintaining accurate and relevant information.
