  "abstract": " In this study, researchers aim to understand the impact of prey availability and harmful algal blooms on juvenile fall Chinook salmon in the lower Snake River reservoir. The first objective is to identify the types and densities of prey consumed by these fish during their rearing period in the reservoir. The second objective is to investigate if these fish are at risk from harmful algal blooms through the accumulation of microcystin toxins in their bodies.\n\nTo achieve the first objective, researchers will collect samples of taxa (species) that directly or indirectly support juvenile salmon production in the reservoir. These samples will be representative of the entire reservoir and collected frequently enough to detect seasonal trends. By analyzing the diets of subyearling fall Chinook salmon, they hope to determine which prey are most important for their growth and survival.\n\nThe second objective involves investigating the potential risks posed by harmful algal blooms through the accumulation of microcystin toxins in fish tissue. Sampling will be done during late summer and early autumn when these blooms occur, and researchers will analyze the levels of this toxin in fish tissue to assess the potential risk to juvenile fall Chinook salmon.\n\nThis research is important as it provides valuable information about the food resources available to juvenile salmon in the lower Snake River reservoir and the potential risks associated with harmful algal blooms. This knowledge can help inform management strategies for conserving these important fish populations."

  "value": " Investment in this research project can bring valuable insights into the food sources of juvenile fall Chinook salmon in the lower Snake River reservoirs and their potential risks from harmful algal blooms (HABs). Here's why:\n\n1. Understanding prey availability: Determining the types, spatial densities, and seasonal variations of prey for juvenile fall Chinook salmon is essential to optimize fish production in reservoirs. Knowing the prey composition will help inform stocking strategies, feeding programs, and habitat management efforts. This information can lead to more efficient use of resources and improved survival rates of juvenile salmon.\n\n2. HAB risk assessment: Investigating the potential accumulation of microcystin toxins in subyearling fall Chinook salmon will help determine if these fish are at risk from HABs. Identifying this risk can lead to the implementation of preventive measures such as monitoring programs, warning systems, or contingency plans to mitigate negative impacts on juvenile salmon populations. This investment could protect fish stocks and contribute to sustainable fisheries in the lower Snake River.\n\n3. Food web dynamics: Studying the food web in the lower Snake River reservoirs is crucial for understanding how prey availability, predation, competition, and other interactions shape the ecosystem. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of these relationships will allow us to make more informed decisions regarding fisheries management, conservation efforts, and potential restoration projects.\n\n4. Adaptive management: The results from this research can be used in adaptive management strategies for juvenile salmon production in the lower Snake River reservoirs. By monitoring changes in prey availability and HAB risk factors, managers can respond to new information and adjust their approaches accordingly, ensuring that the population remains healthy and resilient.\n\n5. Public education and awareness: The findings from this project will contribute to increasing public knowledge about juvenile fall Chinook salmon, their food sources, and potential risks from HABs in the lower Snake River reservoirs. This understanding can foster greater appreciation for these fish and the ecosystem they inhabit, which is crucial for long-term conservation efforts.\n\n6. Potential economic benefits: The information gathered through this research project could lead to increased yields of juvenile salmon in the reservoirs, contributing to local economies through fisheries, recreational opportunities, and tourism. Additionally, advances in understanding the food web dynamics and HAB risks may open up new avenues for further research and potential commercial applications."

  "description": " This text discusses the impact of prey quantity and quality on the growth opportunities and life history pathways of juvenile fall Chinook salmon in the lower Snake River reservoir habitats. The food web in the lower Snake River has undergone changes over the last 20 years, with the emergence of new prey species such as Corophium spp., Neomysis mercedis, and the Siberian prawn (Exopalaemon modestus).\n\nThe first objective of this study is to identify and quantify the different types of prey available to juvenile fall Chinook salmon during reservoir rearing, as well as their spatial and seasonal densities. Prey species are collected from various representative sites throughout the reservoir, with sampling frequency sufficient to detect seasonal trends.\n\nThe second objective revolves around the potential risks posed by harmful algal blooms (HABs) on juvenile fall Chinook salmon residing in Lower Granite Reservoir during these events. HABs can indirectly affect subyearling fall Chinook salmon through negative impacts on the food web, as well as directly if fish take up harmful toxins such as microcystin into their bodies either via contaminated prey or across their gills. The study aims to determine the presence and accumulation of microcystin toxin in subyearling fall Chinook salmon tissue during HABs, assessing potential mortality risks or reduced performance due to this toxin exposure.\n\nIt is important to note that collected taxa are either directly or indirectly crucial for the production and growth of juvenile salmon within the lower Snake River ecosystem."
