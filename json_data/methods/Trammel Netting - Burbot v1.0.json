  "abstractText": "As described by Hubert (1996), trammel nets are a passive fishing gear constructed similar to a gill net, except that they consist of two large mesh outer panels and a small mesh inner panel - all of which are suspended from a float line and attached to a lead line. Fish are generally captured in a mesh pocket as they swim through the outer panels andpush into the inner panel. Trammel nets are commonly used for burbot stock assessment, particularly in Wyoming (Abrahamse 2009). Trammel nets have high capture rates relative to other gears used for burbot stock assessment and low capture related mortality.",
