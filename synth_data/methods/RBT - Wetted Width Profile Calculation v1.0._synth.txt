 Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize and analyze the text you provided. Here are the five keywords that I believe are most relevant to the method described:

1. River Channel Measurement
2. GIS Tools (RBT)
3. High Resolution DEMs (Digital Elevation Models)
4. Profile Metrics
5. Data Filtering

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
The method described in the text involves the use of a suite of GIS tools called RBT, which allows users to measure and analyze river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). These DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing or ground-based topographic surveys. The RBT calculates profile metrics at regular intervals along the length of the site, with each profile metric comprising several output values such as mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation. Additionally, the method includes data filtering to exclude outliers from the analysis, with a threshold set at 4 standard deviations from the population mean. This method is useful for analyzing river channels and their features in a detailed and precise manner, providing valuable insights for environmental monitoring and management.

3. Description:
The RBT is a suite of GIS tools that work within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software, specifically designed for measuring and analyzing river channels. It utilizes high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from airborne remote sensing or ground-based topographic surveys to calculate profile metrics at regular intervals along the length of the site. These profile metrics include mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for all profile values as well as filtered mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for a subset of the profile intervals. Filtering removes any values that are more than a set number of standard deviations from the population mean, which is 4 standard deviations in the case of the CHaMP 2011 data. This method is intended to exclude outliers from the metrics and provide a more accurate representation of the river channel's features.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide a detailed and precise analysis of river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and profile metrics. The method aims to exclude outliers from the analysis using data filtering, resulting in more accurate and reliable insights for environmental monitoring and management.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is the reliance on high-quality DEMs derived from airborne remote sensing or ground-based topographic surveys. The accuracy and resolution of these DEMs can significantly impact the results of the analysis. Another constraint is the threshold used for data filtering, which may exclude legitimate data points if set too aggressively. Finally, the method requires a certain level of technical expertise to operate the RBT tools within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software.
