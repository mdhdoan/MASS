  "abstract": " This text describes a protocol for assessing salmonid habitat conditions at a coarse scale, which is useful for restoration practitioners who need to evaluate the overall condition of salmonid habitats across large areas or have limited resources for intensive monitoring surveys. The protocol suggests collecting datasets related to channel unit composition, substrate, undercut banks, large woody debris, entrenchment, and incision. By analyzing these factors, practitioners can gain a fundamental understanding of the habitat conditions within their study site and prioritize protection and restoration activities accordingly. This coarse-scale assessment method helps address the need for efficient and cost-effective assessments of salmonid habitat conditions at larger spatial scales.\n\nHere's an alternative non-technical summary:\n\nRestoration practitioners want to understand the health of salmonid habitats in large areas or with limited resources for detailed surveys. This protocol outlines a method for evaluating essential factors like channel unit composition, substrate, undercut banks, and more. By analyzing these aspects, practitioners can make informed decisions about where to focus their protection and restoration efforts. This coarse-scale assessment approach is vital for efficiently assessing the overall condition of salmonid habitats across broader areas."

  "value": " Topic: Salmonid Habitat Assessment and Restoration\n\nPotential Values:\n1. Understanding of in-channel habitat conditions for salmonid production assessment and prioritization of protection and restoration activities.\n2. Collection of datasets addressing channel unit composition, substrate, undercut banks, large woody debris, entrenchment, and incision for coarse-scale assessments.\n3. Guidance on data collection methods for practitioners with limited resources or broad spatial scales.\n\nWhy invest in this:\nThis investment focuses on improving our understanding of salmonid habitat conditions to support effective restoration efforts. By collecting and analyzing data related to channel unit composition, substrate, undercut banks, large woody debris, entrenchment, and incision across coarse scales, we can prioritize protection and restoration activities more effectively. This investment also provides valuable assistance for practitioners with limited resources or broad spatial scales, enabling them to assess current conditions and make informed decisions. Ultimately, this investment supports the long-term health and sustainability of salmonid populations."

  "description": " This text describes a protocol for conducting coarse-scale assessments of salmonid habitat conditions within a study site. The primary audience for this protocol are restoration practitioners who require low resolution evaluations across extensive spatial scales or lack the resources for comprehensive habitat status and effectiveness monitoring surveys.\n\nThe protocol recommends collecting datasets that address several aspects of in-channel habitat condition, including: channel unit composition, substrate type, undercut banks, large woody debris (LWD), entrenchment, and incision. These variables are significant factors affecting salmonid production and can be evaluated at coarse scales to inform priority setting for protection and restoration activities.\n\nChannel unit composition refers to the arrangement and configuration of various physical features within a channel, including pools, riffles, and glides. Substrate type encompasses the size, shape, and composition of the bed materials, influencing the availability and suitability of habitats for salmonids. Undercut banks are areas where the bank has eroded or is undercut by flowing water. These features can provide important refugia and shelter for fish, especially during periods of high flow.\n\nLarge woody debris (LWD) plays a crucial role in enhancing habitat complexity and improving channel stability. Entrenchment is the process of the channel floor sinking below the surrounding floodplain. Conversely, incision refers to the downcutting or deepening of the channel bed over time. Both entrenchment and incision can negatively impact salmonid habitats by altering flow conditions and reducing the availability of suitable habitats.\n\nBy collecting data on these variables, practitioners can carry out coarse-scale assessments to evaluate current salmonid habitat conditions within their study site. These evaluations can inform decision-making related to the prioritization of protection and restoration activities and facilitate pre and post implementation condition comparisons."
