      "Monitoring the health and long-term stability of bird communities can provide an important measure of overall environmental health and (Smits and Fernie 2012) effectiveness of management decisions (Noson and Hutto 2005). Birds are good environmental monitors for several reasons: many species can be monitored simultaneously with a single method, methods for monitoring are well understood and standardized, birds occupy all habitat types, and as a community represent several trophic levels and habitat use guilds. Monitoring species abundance, community diversity, and trends provides information that can be used to determine the effectiveness of management actions in moving towards restoration goals.Point counts are the most widely used quantitative method used for monitoring land birds and involve an observer recording birds from a single point for a standardized time period (Ralph et al. 1995). The methodology follows recommendations by Ralph et al. (1995) and is consistent with that employed by the USDA Forest Service Northern Region Land Bird Monitoring Project (Hutto et al. 2001) and recommendations for the Idaho Partners in Flight Bird Monitoring Plan (Leukering et al. 2000). Fixed-radius plots (where the radius is arbitrarily small) reduce the interspecific difference in detectability by assuming that: a) all the birds within the fixed-radius are detectable; b) observers do not actively attract or repel birds; and c) birds do not move into or out of the fixed-radius plot during the counting period. This allows for comparisons of abundance among species. Unlimited radius plots maximize the amount of data collected because they include all detections and are appropriate when the objective is to monitor population changes within a single population (Ralph et al. 1995). Birds should be tallied in two distance bands, one 0-50 meters from the point center and one >50 meters from the point center. This maximizes data collection while permitting interspecific analysis. Additional information on establishing point count stations, data collection, and sample data forms can be found in Ralph et al. (1993), Ralph et al. (1995), and Huff et al. (2000)."

      "To capture X, Y, and Z coordinates as points and lines that collectively represent a topographic surface of the stream channel and floodplain. Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks.

Burner (1951) reported that the redd size in two streams supporting populations of spring Chinook salmon were different and the stream containing a higher proportion of larger football sized substrate producing smaller redds.

For instance, spawning or dead salmon often have eroded tails (from redd excavation) or enlarged or damaged jaws.  When researchers want to compare fish lengths of male spawners versus female spawners or hatchery spawned females versus carcasses, it is a good idea to use this type of length measurement to remove the bias of the eroded tails on female spawners.  So length measurements are made from specific parts of the body that are intact, such as the orbit and the hypural plate. The hypural plate is comprised of modified vertebrae that support the rays of the caudal fin and originate from the posterior end of the vertebral column (Figure 1)."

      "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

      "Calculation of CPUE for electrofishing",
      "It is often difficult for fisheries researchers and managers to obtain a numeric estimate of a given fish stock fora variety of reasons (e.g., time, funding, logistics, etc.). In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

      "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

      "Effectiveness monitoring for changes to stream habitat should be: (1) relevant to the biotic endpoint, by demonstrating a quantifiable relation; (2) responsive to management impacts; (3) appropriate to the stream network; and (4) measurable with acceptable precision and accuracy. (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks.

A unique design number provided for all probabilistic sites serves as the site name, with the lowest design numbers having the highest priority for survey.Information on spatial distribution is required for Endangered Species Act (ESA) status reviews (McElhany et al. 2000). And GRTS snorkel surveys canfill this need. In particular, GRTS surveys can beused to establish fish distribution and relative abundance at a larger spatial scale generally sampled within a single year. Although GRTS surveys may span several years if all sites could not be surveyed in a single year. Data collected GRTS surveys often might represent the most complete fish assemblage and distribution information, particularly forremote, and mostly inaccessible basins. Over time GRTS surveys cancoverthe majority of available habitat for steelhead and Chinook Salmon, therebyfilling a large data gap for these species and other salmonids.Occupancy information is useful for programs prioritizing habitat restoration projects for both resident and anadromous fish."

      "Effectiveness monitoring for changes to stream habitat should be: (1) relevant to the biotic endpoint, by demonstrating a quantifiable relation; (2) responsive to management impacts; (3) appropriate to the stream network; and (4) measurable with acceptable precision and accuracy. (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Progeny from any of these parents (either collected as juveniles or returning adults), if genotyped, could be assigned back to their parents, thus identifying the hatchery they originated from and exact brood year they were produced in (Anderson and Garza 2005; Steele et al 2011). Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

Pools are bound by a head crest (upstream break in streambed slope) and a tail crest (downstream break in streambed slope).  Only consider main channel pools where the thalweg runs through the pool, and not backwater pools.  Pools span at least 50% of the wetted channel width at any location within the pool. So a pool that spans 50% of the wetted channel width at one point, but spans <50% elsewhere is a qualifying pool.  When islands are present only consider pools in the main channel; dont measure pools in side channels.  If a side channel is present, the pool must span at least 50% of the main channels wetted width; disregard side channels width when making this determination.

A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used.Netting cannot be used to effectively capture rainbow trout, so the AIP is essentially the sole method to reduce rainbow trout predation on kokanee.

Expanded stock and age composition of landings post-season are used to describeand compare fishery performanceamong years.Salmon that are inspected during fisheries sampling receive a visual stock identification (VSI), based on phenotypic characteristics and fin marks (see Protocol 3577: Fisheries Sampling for the Select Area Fisheries Enhancement (SAFE) Program, for example). Stock calls are confirmed with recovered coded-wire tags, when possible, and used to make corrections. From the proportion of correct and incorrect VSIs, correction factors are applied to non-CWT VSIs. Stock calls and corrections are tracked closely when an ESA-listed stock of salmon is part of a mixed-stock fishery, which occurs in a short time frame to aid in-season management. Scales samples that are collected during fishery sampling are sent to agency labs, mounted, read, agesrecorded, and expanded to landings."

      "Catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) can be used as a measure of relative abundance of juvenile fishes during rearing acknowledging changes in sampling efficiency over time and from year to year (e.g., Figure 1 inset) In turn, the correlation between CPUE and variables such as the median time of downstream dispersal from rearing areas can be used to evaluate the evidence for a density-dependent response. The relation between CPUE and timing of downstream dispersal for Snake River fall Chinook salmonOncorhynchus tshawytschajuveniles was first described by Connor et al. (2013; Figure 5 inset). It was concluded that timing of downstream dispersal became later as relative abundance along the shorelines increased. That baseline information will be important to consider when assessing the status of the population when future levels of abundance are higher than presently observed and a decision is made about removing Snake River basin fall Chinook salmon from the federal list of threatened species. Methods for calculating CPUE are described here."

Tags in fish can be implanted gastrically (into the stomach) or surgically in the peritoneal cavity. Gastic tagging can be quick, but may result in a ruptured esophagus or stomach. Surgical tagging is more time consuming, requires more handling of the fish, and increases the potential for infection at the surgical site (Martinelli et al. 1998). But, it has been shown thatgrowth, feeding behavior, and condition of salmonids were less affected by the presence of surgically implanted tags over a long term (21 days) than by gastrically implanted tags (Adams et al. 1998; Martinelli et al. 1998)."

      "One of the first tests that geneticists perform on a dataset is to measure whether the genotypes in the sample are present in the expected proportions given the observed allele frequencies.  They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

Hatchery-origin Chinook will be; (a) retained to reduce escapement of hatchery fish and reducepHOSand increasePNIto achieve population goals(b) retained for use in Chief Joseph Hatchery segregated programbroodstockif needed; or (c) released upstream of the weir for continued migration to the spawning grounds if overall run size is relatively low (<5,000) andpHOSis also low (<20%).2. Natural-origin Chinook will be; (a) released upstream of the weir for continued migration to the spawning grounds; or (b) retained for use in Chief Joseph Hatchery integrated programbroodstock.Weir efficiency is a measure of the proportion of total spawning escapement encountered by the weir. After spawning ground surveys are completed, all ofthe weirtrapping and estimated Okanogan spawning escapement informationis gathered to calculate the weir efficiency"

The continuous temperature results are assessed using Ecologys policy for identifying impairments under the federal Clean Water Act (Section 303(d)), which requires stream temperature to be measured on consecutive days in order to apply the criterion.The Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) will be followed for the installation and maintenance of continuous temperature ambient monitoring stations. These protocols reflect in part those outlined in the TFW Stream Temperature Survey Manual (Schuett-Hames et al, 1999), Continuous Temperature Sampling Protocols for the Environmental Monitoring and Trends Section (http://www.ecy.wa.gov/biblio/0103036.html) (Ward, 2003), Measuring Stream Temperature with Digital Data Loggers (USFS, 2005), and Standard Operating Procedures for continuous temperature monitoring of fresh water rivers and streams conducted in a Total Maximum."

      "Beach Seine - Perpendicular Set",
      "Beach and pole seining can be an efficient method to capture fishes in a wide variety of habitats, including rivers, estuarine, and nearshore lake, reservoir, and marine habitats (Pierce et al. 1990). It is most effective when used in relatively shallow water with few obstructions, where fish are in high concentrations, and for species that are less likely to outswim the net; however, in some circumstances seining can capture highly mobile species such as adult salmon. Seining permits the sampling of relatively large areas in short periods of time as well as the capture and release of fish without significant stress or harm, as long as the bunt of the seine is kept in water and the fish are not too crowded (or fish are quickly moved to a holding container). Cost of gear, boats, and personnel range from relatively inexpensive to modest, depending on the scope and frequency of sampling.Seining may be carried out in a variety of habitat types, depending on the population and life stage of the targeted species. Sites with irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, or dense stands of aquatic vegetation may not be suitable for seining due to net snagging or lifting and reduced fish retention. Current velocity and depth influence site selection and choice of net design. Seines vary in size and design. To help understand what affects selectivity and capture efficiencyand therefore, effectiveness of seiningwe considered the following categories: habitat, water, fish, time of year and day, net, and method. Considering these factors in your study design before you sample and after you begin sampling (by underwater observation and calibration studies) will help you to decide when seining may be a good technique to meet your objectives; it will also help improve the analysis of data collected.Perpendicular set beach seining may be used for fish/area or fish/volume analysis (length, width, and depth must be measured), but fish/set is appropriate only if the distance pulled is consistent. The poles may be marked with 0.1-m-depth increments to facilitate measuring the water depth at the offshore end of the seine (note: take an average of two or more depths). To ensure consistent width of swept area, a rope of known length can be attached to the upper end of each pole (DE in Figure 1) and stretched tight during seining."

      "Multiple pass removal/depletion backpack electrofishing v1.0",
      "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

The identification of channel units provides the context for the survey of fish habitat attributes and channel topography. Channel units are delineated according to a two-tiered hierarchical classification schema (Fig 11). The following criteria should be used when considering sections of channel for delineation as unique channel units: 1. In general, channel units are at least as long as the wetted channel width. 2. Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4. Falls, steps, and plunge pools are rarely as long as the wetted channel width, but should be delineated as separate channel units due to their importance as fish habitat and areas of topographic complexity."

      "Bankfull Width Calculation v1.0",
      "The River Bathymetry Toolkit (RBT) is a suite of GIS tools for processing high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of stream reaches. The RBT is being actively developed by ESSA Technologies and is available for free. The goal is to characterize in-stream and floodplain geomorphology to support aquatic habitat analyses and numerical models of flow and sediment transport. Tools were created for ArcGIS to conduct several types of analyses associated with DEMs, including geomorphic change detection, uncertainty analyses, user-defined density of cross-sections and longitudinal profiles. These tools can extract hydrologic parameters such as wetted area, bankfull width, water depths, hydraulic radius, gradient, sinuosity (McKean et al. 2009), erosion and depositional patterns and budgets, and uncertainty in the DEM (Wheaton et al. 2010). Using an automated detrending algorithm we are able to remove the overall valley slope. Tools are being created that use the detrended raster to investigate flooding outside a main channel at any prescribed discharge or flow stage. The RBT will also allow users to recreate other survey protocols that use cross-sectional and longitudinal profile approaches. The CHaMP - Topographic Point Collection Methods (Method ID:5328) provides background on collection of the X, Y, Z point measurement data used to generated the DEM that is analyzed for this calculation."

Fish to be tagged may or may not be anesthetized first, and will depend on the species and how quickly they can be handled during the tagging process.Anchor tags are composed of a T-shaped (T-bar) or barbed (dart) attachment end that is embedded in the fish. The other end is a colored plastic tube or streamer that typically has information about the project printed on it (Zale et al. 2012).

      "Fyke netting is a passive capture method used for sampling juvenile salmon and steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss that use lentic habitats and estuary areas and, in some cases, stream habitats. Fyke nets are large hoop nets with wings (and/or a lead) that are attached to the first frame and act as funnels to direct swimming fish into the trap (see Figure 1). The second and third frames each hold funnel throats, which prevent fish from escaping as they enter each section. The opposite end of the net may be tied with a slip cord to facilitate fish removal. These nets are typically used in shallow water (where the first hoop is less than 1 m under the waters surface), although some lake studies have used fyke nets where the water was as deep as 10 m over the first frame. This deep-set approach has resulted in comparable data to shallower sets, except for 0-age fish where the deeper sets had lower catch values.  The net is set so that the leads intercept moving fish. When the fish try to get around the lead, they swim into the enclosure. Leads and wings are held in place by poles or anchors. Modified fyke nets have rectangular frames to enhance their stability. The square or rectangular frames prevent the net from rolling on the bottom substrate (Hubert 1996). Fyke nets are suspended between buoyant and weighted lines much like a gill net.Fyke netting is a useful method for sampling fish that use lentic habitats and estuarine areas. It is commonly used to monitor the yearly changes in fish species abundances in sites where seining cannot be used alone or in combination with other methods for a markrecapture study. If the habitat has large and uneven substrate, significant woody debris, or other obstructions, seining may not be possible, and fyke nets may provide a viable alternative. Fyke nets tend to be the most useful in capturing cover-seeking mobile species and migratory species that follow the shorelines, and have been used to a sample juvenile salmon in estuary habitat in the Skagit River in Washington (E. Beamer, Skagit River System Cooperative, personal communication). Fyke nets induce less stress on captured fish than do entanglement gears (Hopkins and Cech 1992), and most captured fish can be released unharmed. Fyke nets are widely used in the assessment of fisheries stocks because of the low mortality of fish and aspects of their species and size selectivity. Trap mortality for steelhead caught using fyke nets in the Noyo River in California was less than 1% (Gallagher 2000)."

One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size.

Adultmusselsmay also be completely buried insediments and not detectable without excavationduring high flows. Freshwater mussels are only in permanently wetted areas of a stream or river, thus conducting mussel surveys during typical low water levels reduces potential areas to survey, and helps focus efforts only in the permanently wetted areas where mussels will persist. Areas of high mussel density should be snorkeled to avoid crushing or disturbingmussels by wading methods.Snorkeling to observe freshwater mussels differs in several ways to snorkel surveys to observe fish, as freshwater mussels are stationary in the timescale required to survey a stream reach, and may be mostly buried in sediments with only 0.5 to ~5 centimeters of inhalant or exhalent aperture soft tissues visible.Freshwater mussel genuscan be determined byobservation ofpapillaearound theinhalantaperture for many rivers in the Pacific region (see Haag 2012, andBlevins et al. 2017 for information aboutSinanodonta beringiana), thus in conditions ofgood visibility, extraction and handling ofan observed mussel are not required.Many musselbeds onlycontain one species, making handling of individual animals for identification unnecessary.

      "This methodshould be used to determine whether the designed fish passage criteria are met post-construction such that fish passage remains possible. The purpose is to determine whether an engineered solution to a fish passage problem remains viable for at least five years. Natural stream channels provide the benchmark for the passage of all fish for the various life stages at which they migrate. The further a crossing structure (e.g., dam, culvert) departs from the prevailing natural condition, the more impaired fish passage typically becomes. The degree to which the completed passage structure complies with design criteria could measure effectiveness.New stream crossing structures and restoration of fish passage at identified fish passage barriers should utilize design criteria provided through WDFW in the Water Crossing Design Guidelines (Barnard et al. 2013). The methodology in this section will encompass the data necessary to complete evaluations of fish passage structures found inFish Passage Barrier and Surface Water Diversion Screen Assessment and Prioritization(WDFW 2009). These guidelines are based on best available science related to fish passage. In addition to those criteria, the gradient of the fish passage structure will be measured and compared to the original design criteria. Deviations of greater than 20% shall be considered out of compliance.Projects designed and constructed to criteria in the above-referenced guidance documents are presumed to provide fish passage. Therefore, monitoring of project design upon completion of construction and over time constitutes the most appropriate and measurable effectiveness monitoring. Additionally, to assess whether partial fish passage barriers have been improved, it is necessary to evaluate adult and juvenile fish densities to determine whether increased fish utilization has been accomplished."

      "Growth rate is the growth, or the change in the length or weight of an individual, over a period of time. Growth can provide information on health, population dynamics, and habitat quality (Quist et al. 2012). The method described here relies on direct observation of individuals and entails capturing, marking (using VI, PIT, or other tags with unique identifiers), and recapturing at regular intervals to obtain length and weight data. Because of this, the method is the least variable and most accurate for determining growth as measurement error is the only source of possible variation. That said, the effort to mark and recapture can be labor intensive and costly, so growth information is often supplemental to the primary purpose of the mark recapture study."

      "Physical Habitat: Substrate Size and Channel Dimensions v1.0",
      "This method is derived from an Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) protocol developed for monitoring western wadable streams. Included in this method are instructions for measuring stream substrate size and embeddedness at cross sectional transects. In addition wetted width, water depth and other physical dimensions are also recorded.Substrate Size and Channel Dimensions:Substrate size is one of the most important determinants of habitat character for fish and macroinvertebrates in streams. Here, we use the term substrate size to describe the size of streambed surface particles Along with bedform (e.g., riffles and pools), substrate influences the hydraulic roughness and consequently the range of water velocities in the channel. It also influences the size range of interstices that provide living space and cover for macroinvertebrates, salamanders, and sculpins. Substrate characteristics are often sensitive indicators of the effects of human activities on streams. Decreases in the mean substrate size and increases in the percentage of fine sediments, for example, may destabilize channels and indicate changes in the rates of upland erosion and sediment supply (Dietrich et al. 1989, Wilcock 1998).In the EMAP protocol, substrate size and embeddedness are evaluated at each of the 11 cross-section transects (refer to Figure 7-1) using a combination of methods adapted from those described by Wolman (1954), Bain et al. (1985), Platts et al. (1983), and Plafkin et al. (1989). Substrate size is also evaluated at 10 additional cross-sections located midway between each of the 11 regular transects (A-K). The basis of the protocol is a systematic selection of 5 substrate particles from each of 21 cross-section transects (Figure 7-6). In the process of measuring substrate particle sizes at each channel cross section, the wetted width of the channel and the water depth at each substrate sample point are measured (at the 10 midway cross-sections, only substrate size and wetted width are recorded). If the wetted channel is split by a mid-channel bar (see Section 7.4.1), the five substrate points are centered between the wetted width boundaries regardless of the mid-channel bar in between. Consequently, substrate particles selected in some cross sections may be high and dry. For cross-sections that are entirely dry, make measurements across the unvegetated portion of the channel. The distance you record to the right bank is the same as the wetted channel width. The substrate sampling points along the cross-section are located at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of the measured wetted width, with the first and last points located at the water's edge just within the left and right banks."

      "Variable mesh gill nets are appropriate for sampling when fish mortality is not a limiting factor. Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993).

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

      "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

Most preservation techniques focus on eliminating water from the sample through chemical or physical drying. This is done since most of the harmful enzymes that degrade DNA require an aqueous environment to function. One of the most common methods for dessication involves storing the sample in ethanol. However, purchasing non-denatured ethanol is usually expensive and requires permits. In addition, shipping ethanol preserved samples requires special packaging and declaration. Finally, ethanol preserved samples need to be checked for evaporation and for dilution, and are best stored in a refrigerator or freezer. An alternative to chemical dessication are dry preservation techniques (Lahood et al 2008). The outline below describes a method for sampling and storing fish tissue on cellulose-based filter paper.

      "Electrofishing - Fish Processing and Recovery",
      "Fish handling procedures are a critical element of sampling, especially in systems with threatened or endangered species. As researchers and managers, we are obliged to handle the fish we are sampling responsibly (Nickum et al. 2004). This is an important topic that should be considered by all practitioners sampling fish. Detailed fish handing guidelines are available from Nickum et al. 2004, the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) 2005, and Stickney (1983). When markrecapture sampling, it is critical that handled and marked fish return to normal activities before the recapture sample begins to help satisfy the equal catchability assumption associated with markrecapture estimators. There are several examples of things we can do to reduce the handling stress of sampled fish. For instance, minimize sampling at water temperatures above 18 degrees Celsius, use live well colors that mimic the natural environment and included cover, avoid overcrowding fish in live wells, and segregate large predatory fish from small fish to prevent predation in the live well. Also, the zone 0.5 m from an electrofishing anode has been termed the potential zone of injury; thus fish in close proximity to the anode should be quickly removed from it while electrofishing (NMFS 2000). After removal from the water, captured fish should be held for the shortest time possible in live wells with recirculated or aerated water that has approximately the same temperature as the ambient water temperature they were removed from. An innovative live well design used for holding captured stream fish was proposed by Isaak and Hubert (1997) for stream sampling and by Sharber and Carothers (1987) for boat or raft units. Perhaps the most important consideration is to minimize handling of fish during any research or sampling activity."

      "Stream discharge is equal to the product of the mean current velocity and vertical cross sectional area of flowing water.  Discharge measurements are important for assessing trends in streamwater acidity and other characteristics that are very sensitive to streamflow differences.  Stream discharge information is also useful in interpreting the representativeness of water chemistry data and some physical habitat information.  The response design for stream discharge involves a single determination at suitable location within the support reach to characterize conditions at the sampling point.  The location selected should be as close as possible to the location where chemical samples are collected, so that these data correspond.  No single method for measuring discharge is applicable to all types of stream channels.  The preferred procedure is based on velocity-area methods, and provides either the measurement data to calculate discharge or the calculated value for stream discharge.  For streams too small or too shallow there are 2 other methods: neutrally bouyant velocity procedure and  timed filling procedure."

Included in this method are instructions for measuring riparian canopy cover. Riparian canopy cover over a stream is important not only for its role in moderating stream temperatures through shading, but also as an indicator of conditions that control bank stability and the potential for inputs of coarse and fine particulate organic material. Organic inputs from riparian vegetation become food for stream organisms and structure to create and maintain complex channel habitat."

      "Determining Effectiveness of Fish Passage Structures- Culverts v1.0",
      "This methodshould be used to determine whether the designed fish passage criteria are met post-construction such that fish passage remains possible. The purpose is to determine whether an engineered solution to a fish passage problem remains viable for at least five years. Natural stream channels provide the benchmark for the passage of all fish for the various life stages at which they migrate. The further a crossing structure (e.g., dam, culvert) departs from the prevailing natural condition, the more impaired fish passage typically becomes. The degree to which the completed passage structure complies with design criteria could measure effectiveness.New stream crossing structures and restoration of fish passage at identified fish passage barriers should utilize design criteria provided through WDFW in the Water Crossing Design Guidelines (Barnard et al. 2013). The methodology in this section will encompass the data necessary to complete evaluations of fish passage structures found inFish Passage Barrier and Surface Water Diversion Screen Assessment and Prioritization(WDFW 2009). These guidelines are based on best available science related to fish passage. In addition to those criteria, the gradient of the fish passage structure will be measured and compared to the original design criteria. Deviations of greater than 20% shall be considered out of compliance.Projects designed and constructed to criteria in the above-referenced guidance documents are presumed to provide fish passage. Therefore, monitoring of project design upon completion of construction and over time constitutes the most appropriate and measurable effectiveness monitoring. Additionally, to assess whether partial fish passage barriers have been improved, it is necessary to evaluate adult and juvenile fish densities to determine whether increased fish utilization has been accomplished."

These materials influence channel stability and resistance to scour during high flow events. The frequency of bed load transport can be critically important to fish spawning and other aquatic organisms that use the substrate for cover. The pebble count procedure was originally designed to quantify streambed substrate without having to collect substrate samples and take them back to the lab for sieve analysis. The procedure requires taking measurements of substrate at increments along main channel and side channels transects within bankfull constraints."

      "Stream Discharge v1.0",
      "Because velocity and depth typically vary greatly across a stream, accuracy in field measurements is achieved by measuring the mean velocity and flow cross-sectional area of many increments across a channel (Figure 22). Each increment gives a subtotal of the stream discharge, and the whole is calculated as the sum of these parts. Discharge measurements are made at only one carefully chosen channel cross-section. It is important to choose a channel cross-section that is as much like a canal as possible. A glide area with a U-shaped channel cross-section that is free of obstructions provides the best conditions for measuring discharge. You may remove rocks and other obstructions to improve the cross-section before any measurements are made."

The interval distance is customizable. For the 2011 CHaMP data the interval distance was 0.5m. Each profile metric comprises several output values: - Mean for all profile values - Standard deviation across all profile values - Coefficient of variation across all profile values - Filtered mean of selected profile values - Filtered standard deviation across selected profile values - Filtered coefficient of variation across all profile values - All profile values along with their cumulative interval distance downstream from the top of the site. The filtered metrics report the same statistics but for a subset of the profile intervals. Filtering removes any values from the population that are more than a set number of standard deviations from the population mean. For CHaMP 2011, this filtering threshold is set at 4 standard deviations. This is intended to exclude outliers from the metrics.

      "Physical Habitat: Substrate Size and Channel Dimensions",
      "This method is derived from an Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) protocol developed for monitoring western wadable streams. Included in this method are instructions for measuring stream substrate size and embeddedness at cross sectional transects. In addition wetted width, water depth and other physical dimensions are also recorded.Substrate Size and Channel Dimensions:Substrate size is one of the most important determinants of habitat character for fish and macroinvertebrates in streams. Here, we use the term substrate size to describe the size of streambed surface particles Along with bedform (e.g., riffles and pools), substrate influences the hydraulic roughness and consequently the range of water velocities in the channel. It also influences the size range of interstices that provide living space and cover for macroinvertebrates, salamanders, and sculpins. Substrate characteristics are often sensitive indicators of the effects of human activities on streams. Decreases in the mean substrate size and increases in the percentage of fine sediments, for example, may destabilize channels and indicate changes in the rates of upland erosion and sediment supply (Dietrich et al. 1989, Wilcock 1998).In the EMAP protocol, substrate size and embeddedness are evaluated at each of the 11 cross-section transects (refer to Figure 7-1) using a combination of methods adapted from those described by Wolman (1954), Bain et al. (1985), Platts et al. (1983), and Plafkin et al. (1989). Substrate size is also evaluated at 10 additional cross-sections located midway between each of the 11 regular transects (A-K). The basis of the protocol is a systematic selection of 5 substrate particles from each of 21 cross-section transects (Figure 7-6). In the process of measuring substrate particle sizes at each channel cross section, the wetted width of the channel and the water depth at each substrate sample point are measured (at the 10 midway cross-sections, only substrate size and wetted width are recorded). If the wetted channel is split by a mid-channel bar (see Section 7.4.1), the five substrate points are centered between the wetted width boundaries regardless of the mid-channel bar in between. Consequently, substrate particles selected in some cross sections may be high and dry. For cross-sections that are entirely dry, make measurements across the unvegetated portion of the channel. The distance you record to the right bank is the same as the wetted channel width. The substrate sampling points along the cross-section are located at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of the measured wetted width, with the first and last points located at the water's edge just within the left and right banks."

      "Mark-Recapture Estimates from Snorkeling Data v1.0",
      "Snorkeling is the underwater observation and study of fish in flowing waters. Snorkel surveys can be used with other techniques to estimate abundance using markrecapture techniques. The use of snorkel surveys for markrecapture estimates provides a calibration factor for the counting efficiency of snorkel surveys as compared to other methods such as electrofishing and seining. For this technique to be used, the system should be closed off with block nets so that the total population observed is constant. For markrecapture estimates, fish need to be collected, marked, and released back to the sample area. Collection occurs with electrofishing, seining, or trapping; marking is done using tags or dyes with color coding or patterns; and release is into the sample reach. Snorkel surveys can then be conducted in the same sample reach to count the number of marked fish. The ratio of the number of fish resighted (i.e., those with marks that are counted) can be used as a calibration factor for the effectiveness of a snorkel survey compared to other survey methods. Fish can be marked differently based on size-class and species recorded by observers, which can help identify those species and size-classes that may have been undercounted using a snorkel survey approach."

Stream discharge information is also useful in interpreting the representativeness of water chemistry data and some physical habitat information.  The response design for stream discharge involves a single determination at suitable location within the support reach to characterize conditions at the sampling point.  The location selected should be as close as possible to the location where chemical samples are collected, so that these data correspond.  No single method for measuring discharge is applicable to all types of stream channels.  The preferred procedure is based on velocity-area methods, and provides either the measurement data to calculate discharge or the calculated value for stream discharge.

      "Plankton are small plants or animals that float, drift, or weakly swim in the water column of any body of water. Zooplankton are the animal portion of the planktonand represent the secondary production in a lake or reservoir.The zooplankton can display a high degree of spatial variation, even when considering only the open water (limnetic) region of a lake. This patchiness results from a variety of factors -- including water currents and rapid population growth in locations where phytoplankton biomass is high.There are statistical methods to identify the number of samples required to accurately characterize the zooplankton at a particular time in a lake. This requires preliminary sampling at many locations and some simple statistics. One problem is that if spatial distribution varies markedly over time, the value of this approach may be limited. However, an intensive preliminary study still can provide a context, so that the investigator may provide appropriate caveats when interpreting results of sampling at a lower intensity.In reality, main factors that determine the number of samples are: time, money, objectives of the study, and type of lakes to be sampled. For example, if a study aims to generally characterize the zooplankton of a particular geographic region, and requires sampling of many lakes, it only may be feasible to sample one location in each lake or major basin of larger more complex lakes. In elongated reservoirs, samples typically are collected at several sites along the longitudinal axis, because those lakes have zones with distinct water chemistry, phytoplankton, and zooplankton as one moves from the often turbid upstream end to the algal dominated downstream end.The bottom line is that there is no magic number for how many samples to collect to characterize a lake's zooplankton., but the sampling regime should be grounded in a solid understanding of lake conditions and the questions being asked in the research project.This method describes standard procedures for collecting zooplanktonusingvertical tows."

      "Limnological survey- Collecting Phytoplankton v1.0",
      "Phytoplankton are free-floating algae that are the dominant form of plants in larger lakes and reservoirs andaccountfor the majority of primary productionin these systems (Horne and Goldman 1994). Phytoplantkon abundance and species composition can be controlled by a number of factors, including nutrient availability, temperature, light and grazing pressure. The abundance of phytoplankton is important to lake and fisheries managers, as too little can mean alimited food supply for fish and too much can lead to poor water quality. The composition of the phytoplankton community is equally important. Some taxaare highly nutritious and easily consumed by zooplankton, leading to increased secondary production and potentially clearer water as these taxa are grazed down. Other taxa are not edible, and therefore not controlled by grazing zooplankton, which can lead to nuisance blooms. A few of these taxa can produce toxins, making them a hazard to public health.This method provides details for field collection and preservation of water samples for analysis of phytoplanktonabundance and composition by an outside analytical lab using techniques based on Utermohl 1958."

      "Primary Productivity Assessment v1.0",
      "Primary productivity can not be accurately assessed using data describing chlorophyll concentrations or standing phytoplankton density or biovolume. Changes in primary production are not always reflected by changes in standing stock. Primary productivity can be masked or exaggerated by changes in grazing pressure. The best way to assess changes to primary production is to measure carbon uptake rates directly. The following methodology was developed to measure primary production in terms of carbon uptake by the phytoplankton community. Size fractionation makes it possible to differentiate production from the pico, nano, microplankton communities."

Discharge measurements are important for assessing trends in streamwater acidity and other characteristics that are very sensitive to streamflow differences.  Stream discharge information is also useful in interpreting the representativeness of water chemistry data and some physical habitat information.  The response design for stream discharge involves a single determination at suitable location within the support reach to characterize conditions at the sampling point.  The location selected should be as close as possible to the location where chemical samples are collected, so that these data correspond.  No single method for measuring discharge is applicable to all types of stream channels.

      "Background:Data collected from groundwater monitoring are used to detect changes in water table elevation and groundwater temperature patterns. Changes in water table elevation and groundwater temperature are anintended result of certain restoration activities (e.g., floodplain reconnection projects) and monitoring these patterns can help provide evidence that restoration work is achieving project goals.This method describes ananalysis procedure for groundwater temperature data, and assumes that data were collected in at least one reference site (which received no manipulations for the purpose of restoration) and one treated site (where restoration activities have occurred). The goal of the analysis is to compare the amplitude and synchronicity of groundwater and surface water temperature cycles in restored and reference areas. Groundwater temperature patterns are expected to more closely align with surface water patterns in areas where groundwater is closer to the land surface (Stonestrom and Constantz, 2003). If such alignment occurs, these data provide corroborating evidence of water table rise and groundwater-surface water exchange (e.g., groundwater recharge from overbank inundation). This is an important goal for some restoration projects.This procedure models seasonal oscillations in groundwater and surface water temperature in order to examine their amplitude and timing and to evaluate how these parameters have changed since restoration. This methodassumes that groundwater data were collected from wells installed as part of a restoration monitoring design and instrumented with Onset HOBOU20Water Level Loggers (U20probes), and that data were collected at a resolution of one reading per hour or two hours for the duration of the monitoring period. Similarly, hourly monitoring data from surface water temperature loggers (e.g., Onset Tidbit v2 or Stowaway XTI loggers) located near the treated and control sites are also prerequisites for this analysis.Analysis of water table elevation data isdiscussed in a separate method."

      "Chlorophyll is the photosynthetic pigment in found in plants, including phytoplankton. There are three major forms of chlorophyll:a,b, andc. While all three forms are able to capture light, only chlorophylla(chla) is able convert this energy to chemical energy via photosynthesis(Horne and Goldman 1994). Chlaconcentrations are often used by researchers or lake managers as an index of the standing stock of phytoplankton. High levels ofchlacan be considered indicators of reduced water quality due to nuisancealgal blooms. Chlaconcentrations have also been used as an index of lake productivity (Rieman and Myers 1992).This methods describes a field technique for collecting chlasamples to be analyzed by a contracting lab.

Phytoplantkon abundance and species composition can be controlled by a number of factors, including nutrient availability, temperature, light and grazing pressure. The abundance of phytoplankton is important to lake and fisheries managers, as too little can mean alimited food supply for fish and too much can lead to poor water quality. The composition of the phytoplankton community is equally important. Some taxaare highly nutritious and easily consumed by zooplankton, leading to increased secondary production and potentially clearer water as these taxa are grazed down. Other taxa are not edible, and therefore not controlled by grazing zooplankton, which can lead to nuisance blooms. A few of these taxa can produce toxins, making them a hazard to public health.This method provides details for field collection and preservation of water samples for analysis of phytoplanktonabundance and composition by an outside analytical lab using techniques based on Utermohl 1958."

      "Video Methodology - Field Setup and Operation v1.0",
      "Video equipment can be used to create high-quality records of fish passage using relatively inexpensive equipment and adequate lighting (Hatch et al. 1994). These data are collected at less cost than direct observation or weirs. Video also creates a permanent record of the observations, which can be reanalyzed if necessary to allow for specimen identification or development of confidence bounds on escapement estimates (Hatch et al. 1994). Staff fatigue can be reduced by spacing out the time used for interpretation or by using technology to help interpret images (Irvine et al. 1991). Recent users of video technology have been working on computer image processing automation (Hatch et al. 1994, 1998) and on recording triggered by motion detection to reduce the number of blank images on tape. Video offers a permanent record of the number of fish and often the species and size that pass an area, and it can be used to compare differences between years and site conditions as well (Hiebert et al. 2000). A permanent record is especially helpful when time constraints do not allow for immediate data analysis (Irvine et al. 1991). Additionally, video can be used to assess populations without any handling of the fish species, reducing potential stress on fish. Finally, video surveys have little impact on the environment and do not cause fish mortality. Video surveys can be used at existing facilities such as dams and fishways but can also be applied in remote locations (see Figure 1). Systems that are lightweight, transportable, and run under their own power (solar, wind, or hydrogenerated power) have been developed for remote application (Otis and Dickson 2002). Time savings from video surveys vary by application. Hatch et al. (1994) found that 3 d of migration could be reviewed in 6 h, or 2 h per d. Otis and Dickson (2002) determined total fish passage in an average of 38 min per d of video at one sample site and 16 min per d at another. An additional 29 min and 40 min per d of video were required to determine species composition at each site, respectively, using a subsample of the first 15 min of every h (Otis and Dickson 2002). Efficiency rates of 3.6% and 2.1% were calculated for these two sites, reducing the amount of staff time needed for results by 96.4% and 97.9%. Hatch et al. (1994) found an overall time savings of 92% using video surveys versus visual observation. The primary objectives of using videography with salmonids include(1) determining, or estimating, total numbers of moving or migrating fish at a sampling site;(2) determining, or estimating, species composition of moving or migrating fish at a sampling site;(3) determining, or estimating, the numbers of hatchery versus wild fish by close examination of body markers or fin clips; (4) characterizing the body sizes of fish moving or migrating past a sampling site; (5) assessing spawner and redd density, distribution, and habitat characteristics (e.g., deepwater environments); and(6) characterizing behavioral aspects of fish (e.g., mating, habitat selection, hesitation in migration)."

      "The Integrated Status andEffectivnessMonitoring Program (ISEMP) will be developing a gross primary production (GPP) model for stream networks in the Columbia Basin in order to make spatially-explicit predictions regardingsalmonidhabitat needs. PreliminaryGPPmodel development work by Eco Logical Research, Inc. (ELR) has shown promising results using temperature, solar inputs, and conductivity as model inputs. Solar insolation directly affects stream temperature (Sinokrotand Stefan, 1993) and the primary productivity of streams (Fisher and Likens, 1973; Hill et al., 1995). Work to date has explored using areal solar insolation for the solar input parameter. ELRhasdeveloped a preliminary workflow for predicting solar insolation for a stream network, summarizing the average upstream solar insolation values (watt hours per square meter,WH/m2) per ~200 meters stream segments. South Fork Research, Inc. (SFR) is improving this method and automating the solar insolation modeling process through the development of ArcGIS Python tools. Specifically, we developed a methodology for modeling solar insolation thatemulate the effects of shading from riparian vegetation and topography.The Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program (CHaMP) protocol collects of solar insolation data during stream surveys, however, collecting field-based solar insolation measurements comprehensively (continuously along network) for the entire stream network of the Columbia Basin is resource prohibitive. Developing a spatially-explicit model to predict solar insolation for all stream networks and associated riparian buffers within the Columbia Basin will potentially provide a robust, reliable input forGPPmodeling efforts, and may reduce the need for field-based data collection.To date, our solar modeling efforts have relied on raster data derived from the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset (NBCD) basal area-weighted canopy height dataset. TheNBCDwas developed by the Woods Hole Research Center in 2000, and combines high-resolution inSAR data acquired by the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, and remotely-sensed data from the Landsat ETM+ sensor. The tool then combines basal area-weighted canopy height values with bare-earth topographic values from a National Elevation Dataset (NED) high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM), resulting in a relatively close approximation of stream shading, when calculating solar insolation using ESRIsArea Solar Radiationtool. While we have obtained good results using NBCD basal area-weighted canopy height data, any vegetation height raster dataset (with elevation values in meters) will work as an input for the tool.Model Inputs: NHD+ 1:24k flowlines, segmented NED DEM 10m2 USGS Hydrologic Unit polygon (i.e. HUC4, HUC5) Stream area polygon (i.e. bankfull or NHD Area) NBCDbasal-area weighted (BAW) canopy height"

      "Physiological Assessment of Maturation of Male Salmon and Steelhead",
      "Previous studies demonstrated that steelhead residuals are a mixture of fish that failed to migrate because they either did not smolt or were maturing males (Sharp et al. 2007). The goal of assessing reproductive status of age 1 or 2 males prior to release from the hatchery is to estimate the proportion of males that may residualize because they are either mature (running) precocious parr or have initiated maturation for spawning a year after release. In the case of summer run steelhead, adults migrate to natal rivers in summer where they reside over winter and spawn the subsequent spring. This suggests that initiation of maturation and the spawning migration in this species must occur roughly a year before the fish will spawn. Identification of precious parr can be done by external examination of body morphology and coloration, and by expression of milt with gentle abdominal pressure. However, males that are in the earliest stages of initiating maturation (spermatogenesis) show no unique external characteristics that can be used to distinguish them from immature males or females. Therefore, we developed methods to quantify a series of morphological and endocrine parameters to estimate proportions of one and two-year old male steelhead that are initiating maturation for the following year. These are measured on lethal subsamples of fish, just prior to release from the hatchery in the spring.We based our selection of parameters on the following information. The onset of spermatogenesis is regulated by the reproductive endocrine axis, which includes hormones and growth factors produced by the brain, pituitary gland and testis. External (e.g. photoperiod, temperature) and internal (e.g. metabolic) cues play important roles in regulating the production of brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which in turn stimulates the production and secretion of gonadotropins (follicle stimulating hormone; FSH and luteinizing hormone, LH) that regulate testicular production of androgens (11-ketotestosterone; 11-KT) and growth factors (antmullerian hormone; AMH and insulin like growth factor 3; IGF3) (Schulz et al. 2010). The activation of the pituitary-testis axis during puberty onset in fish involves increases in synthesis of alpha and beta subunits of FSH and LH (mRNA and protein), increases in plasma levels of FSH and 11-KT, and increases in testis IGF3 mRNA and decreases in AMH mRNA in the testis (Gomez et al. 1999; Campbell et al., 2003; Maugars and Schmitz 2008; Schulz et al. 2010; Tarranger et al. 2010). At the level of the testis, the first cellular indication of onset of spermatogenesis is the rapid proliferation of spermatogonia, which precedes the meiotic divisions of germ cells and development of haploid spermatozoa. The rapid proliferation of germ cells results in small increases in gonadosomatic index (GSI) and cytological changes in germ cells that are observable in histological sections of the testis. Relative levels of mRNAs for pituitary FSH and LH beta subunits and testicular IGF3 and AMH are measured from total RNA using quantitative real time RT PCR (qPCR). Details of laboratory analyses are attached."

The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

      "Background:Stream channel incision is a common problem in semi-arid regions of the U.S. Pacific Northwest and many climatically-similar regions throughout the world (Hall et al. 2011). Hydrologicand geomorphologicchanges that occur due tochannel incision often result in the loss of riparian vegetation (Hall et al. 2011). Riparian vegetation influences the geomorphology and hydrology of streams by altering processes such as sedimentation and erosion. For example, riparian vegetation can attenuate floodwaters and promote sediment stabilization (Kauffman et al. 1997,Naiman and Decamps 1997). In addition, vegetation can directly provide important habitat for fish and wildlife via shelter or food resources, or indirectly enhance adjacent habitats such as streams via processes such as shading (Kauffman et al. 1997,Naimanand Decamps 1997). Because of the ecologically important functions that riparian vegetation provides, revegetation is a common activity undertaken in river and stream restoration projects across the United States (Bernhardt et al. 2005, Kauffman et al. 1997).Monitoring is an important aspect of river and stream restoration projects, because it allows for the assessment of project actions and outcomes, thereby providing opportunities to improve future practices (Bernhardt et al. 2005). This method describes data collection conducted to monitor woody riparian revegetation in a small, incised stream system in a semi-arid region of the Pacific Northwest. Tree stakes planted in riparian areas were monitored annually in the spring in order to assess the impacts of herbivory, different herbivory protection structures, spatial location, and plant species on growth and survivorship. This method assumes that the locations of riparian tree stakeswere recorded at the time of initial planting, and that trees were labeled with an identifying tag. This method therefore describes follow up monitoring of an initial restoration design. Field data collection utilizes a database on a tablet device (Figure 1), although paper datasheetscould also be used effectively for monitoring a small restoration project."

Visual surveys should also determine which mussel species are present in the river reach, and individual quadrat counts should inlude notes by species. Personnel should be able to identify species (or to genus for Anodonta species) by visible shell characteristics or by inhalent aperture papillae without causing excessive disturbance to the mussel bed."

The length measurement of choice will depend on the species of interest. For example, a larval mayfly might have its total length measured whereas a crayfish might just have its carapace length measured. The number of individuals measured will also depend on the final use of the data and the amount of length variability in the population. For example, a sample size of 100 individuals might be adequate for generating a length-weight regression, but a sample size of 500 individuals might be more appropriate for discerning the age structure of a population for which many length bins are used. This describes a general method for measuring the length of an invertebrate and should be customized based on the species of interest."

When organism densities are too high to count directly, sub-samples will be taken using a Motodo 1.5 L plankton splitter. Zooplankton samples will be split until approximately 300 organisms of the most prevalent species remain in the sub-sample. Body lengths will be measured from the first 30 individuals of each species within the subsample using a Leica MZ-8 dissecting microscope fitted with an optical micrometer. Remaining individuals will be enumerated by species. Branchiopod body lengths will be measured from the anterior most region of the head to the posterior base of the carapace. Copepod body lengths will be measured from the anterior most region of the head to the base of the caudal ramus. Zooplankton body lengths, densities, and biomass will be calculated. Zooplankton biomass will be determined for each species using length to dry weight regressions of Dumont et al. (1975), Bottrell et al. (1976), and Downing and Rigler."

      "Naturally established versus manipulated wetland basin seed biomass survey v1.0",
      "Moist soil management is a valuable tool for the treatment of wetland habitats and the wildlife species associated with wetlands. The ability to manage water levels, create disturbance, and manipulate vegetation to allow for more productive early successionalwetland habitats is crucial to the TD-1 project. Moist soil management provides critical habitat and food sources for wetland obligate and wetland associated species, while also allowing for valuable recreation opportunities. Through this survey effort we will be inspecting four different techniques used in 5 wetland cells. Cell 1 was left to naturally establish, Cell 2 was harrowed and then Wild Millet was broadcast seeded, Cell 3 was tilled, Cell 4 was harrowed and Wild Millet was drill seeded, and Cell 7 which was tilled. During the end of May 2018 Wetland Specialist McPherson started harrowing wetland cells 2 and 4. Cell 2 was broadcast seeded with Wild Millet beginning June 1, seed was broadcasted at rate of 30lbs per acre.Cell 4 seeding started June 6, seed in this basin was drilled at rate of 25lbs per acre. This was the first year the wildlife area had new drill seeder that could be hauled behind ATV, making it easier to work in wetland basins. Specialist McPherson wanted to evaluate what method of planting would yield higher rate of seed biomass.Both cells 3 and 7 were tilled to set back non desirable vegetation and to turn over soil to aid soil health and help future plantings of desirable waterfowl forage. Tillage started July 11, when Specialist McPherson had returned to cells for second round of heavy tillage in Late August, good volunteer stands of Wild Millet had established. Given the opportunity Specialist McPherson wanted to evaluate the seed biomass present in a volunteer stand of Wild Millet and how that compared to broadcast and drill seeding. The Millet that established voluntarily was stored in the seed bank from prior years plantings."
