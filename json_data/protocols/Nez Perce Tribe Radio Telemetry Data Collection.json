  "background": "The Nez Perce Tribe's Department of Fisheries Resources Management utilize radio telemetry to gather information from returning anadromous adult salmonids (e.g. Chinook salmon andsteelhead). Information is used compare the relative performance of hatchery (supplementation and conventional) and natural origin steelhead with the focus on adult distribution (above and below barriers), and evaluation of the fidelity of adults to their natal stream of origin. Data are utilized for determination of abundance, survival and life history characteristics, hatchery effectiveness and status and trends evaluations. Population status and trend monitoring of natural and hatchery origin fish is used for effective population management, assessing effectiveness of conservation actions, viability, and recovery metric monitoring.Please see protocols #2250 for data anlaysis methods describing the calculation of metrics and indicators.",
