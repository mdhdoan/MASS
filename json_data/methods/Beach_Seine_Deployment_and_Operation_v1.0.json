Collected data areutilized for hatchery effectiveness and status and trends evaluations. The juvenile sampling design consists of a combination of comparative performance testing and population status monitoring to address management objectives and answer questions fundamental to salmonid recovery in the Salmon and Snake River basins. Population status and trend monitoring of natural and hatchery origin fish is used for effective population management, assessing effectiveness of conservation actions, viability, and recovery metric monitoring.",
