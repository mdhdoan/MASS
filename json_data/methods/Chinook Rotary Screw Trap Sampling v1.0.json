  "abstractText": "Rotary screw traps are auseful tool for biologists to capture downstream migrating juvenile anadromous salmonids from streams (Figure 1). This provides anopportunity to deploy tags in juveniles to estimate out of subbasin survival. The use of screw traps is an effective way for biologists to sample and monitornaturally produced juvenile salmonids over time. In addition, they can provide a wayto evaluate a variety of hatchery restoration strategies and their impacts on natural populations (Volkhardt et al. 2007). Samplescollected from screw traps can be used for purposes such as genetics sampling, fish disease, research, and predation (gut content) evaluations.This method describes the use of a rotary screw trap to sample natural and hatchery downstream migrant salmonids as part of a comprehensive monitoring strategy.",
