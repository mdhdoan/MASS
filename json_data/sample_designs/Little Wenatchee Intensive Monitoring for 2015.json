  "description": "<p><strong>2014 design:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An intensive draw was done for the&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;extent of the Little Wenatchee (LWIN&nbsp;master sample). &nbsp;This was seeded by the&nbsp;CBW&nbsp;master sample, and 4 sites overlap in naming convention between the two sets of sites. &nbsp;The&nbsp;CBW&nbsp;name of a site was retained in the design and the&nbsp;LWIN&nbsp;site was not used:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LWIN&nbsp;18=CBW-461995</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200bLWIN49=CBW-391019</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LWIN16=CBW-275627</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LWIN36=CBW-117611</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200b2 strata were used based on preliminary assessments of River Styles done by Terraqua. &nbsp;A total of 5 sites of effort will be sampled: 2 CBW sites and 3 sites from the new strata (1 from *CGS and 2 from *GS. These sites were put into an annual panel , but effort will be reassessed in 2015 to adjust panels and sampling design. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Preliminary evaluations were outlined in LWevaluations_20140820.xls until entered in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Design Updates in 2015:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015 a third River Styles was used to stratify the Little Wenatchee design: &nbsp;Confined Valley with Floodplain Pockets. &nbsp;3 sites were moved from the previous &quot;*CGS&quot; ending River Style to the newly delineated Confined Valley with Floodplain Pockets. Use orders and oversample&nbsp;count were reassigned in the Block Size table. &nbsp;One site will be sampled in the new River Style and the Use Order from the previous draw was maintained (e.g. top use order of old draw will be kept for new stratum). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Design Documentation:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GRTS draw: </strong>done via sample designer (no external draw)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Frame:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pre-determined site evaluations: &nbsp;</strong>LWevaluations_20140820.xlsx</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
