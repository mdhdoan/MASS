2. Abstract: This Environmental Assessment Program (EAP) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the method for obtaining freshwater sediment samples using a grab sampler. The purpose of this SOP is to provide clear instructions on collecting sediment for chemistry or bioassay analyses using various grab sampler designs, specifically Petite Ponar, Ponar, Ekman, and Van Veen. It does not cover other types of samplers or the collection of freshwater benthic invertebrates. The SOP aims to ensure standardization and efficiency in freshwater sediment collection for further analysis.
3. Description: This text presents the EAP Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for freshwater sediment sampling using grab samplers, focusing on Petite Ponar, Ponar, Ekman, and Van Veen designs. The SOP does not intend to be a comprehensive review of other sampler types or equipment. Instead, it highlights the necessity of this method for chemistry or bioassay analyses of freshwater sediments. Furthermore, it clarifies that this SOP is not applicable for marine or estuarine water sampling, which follows different protocols such as Puget Sound Protocols (PSEP, 1997a) and Ecology recommendations (Ecology, 2003). The text also mentions an available SOP for Puget Sound Assessment and Monitoring Program (PSAMP) Marine Sediment Component collection activities performed by Ecology's Marine Monitoring Unit (Ecology, 2007).
4. Target: Standardize freshwater sediment sampling with grab samplers for chemistry or bioassay analyses.
5. Constraints: This SOP only applies to freshwater sediment collection activities using grab samplers and does not cover other sampler types, freshwater benthic invertebrate collection, core samplers, or marine/estuarine water sampling.
