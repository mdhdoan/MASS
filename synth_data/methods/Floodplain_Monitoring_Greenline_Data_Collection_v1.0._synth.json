  "abstract": " This method is used to monitor the vegetation and greenline-to-greenline width (GGW) along the banks of arid and semi-arid streams, with a focus on areas where beaver colonies are present. The data collected at the greenline is important as it indicates the health of the riparian area and can help make early management decisions. Greenline vegetation data provides insights into the susceptibility to erosion, establishment of wetland communities, and invasive species presence. Measuring GGW gives a broader perspective on landscape changes and sediment aggradation over time.\n\nThe method involves collecting data in pairs, one on each side of the stream, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats. The data collected, combined with information about each quadrat's location along the reach, can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization (browse), and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence.\n\nThe necessity of this method lies in the fact that changes occur most rapidly at the greenline due to high disturbance, making it an essential indicator of riparian health and stream ecosystem functionality. By focusing on areas with beaver colonies, we can specifically study the effects of beavers and their dams on floodplain vegetation, which is crucial for understanding how these creatures impact their environment.\n\nThis method builds upon existing monitoring procedures like \"Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation\" and \"Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters.\" By modifying these methods, we can effectively assess the greenline data in a more targeted way to better understand the complex relationship between beavers, their dams, and riparian vegetation."

  "description": " This technical description focuses on the procedure for monitoring streamside vegetation and greenline-to-greenline width (GGW) in arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems dominated by willow and shrub-steppe, with a particular emphasis on areas where beaver colonies are present. The objective of this monitoring procedure is to assess the effects of beaver and their dams on floodplain vegetation at the greenline, as changes in streamside vegetation and GGW are significant indicators of incision levels and riparian health (Burton et al. 2011, Winward 2000).\n\nGreenline data measurements are collected in pairs, one on each side of the channel, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1). The data collection and field procedure follow modified methodologies from Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton et al. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008).\n\nAt the greenline, various stream health indicators can be assessed using the collected data metrics. For instance, the presence or absence of deep-rooted perennial vegetation within quadrats indicates the susceptibility of the streambank to erosion (Burton et al. 2011). The types and abundance of hydrophilic species present suggest successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity (Burton et al. 2011). An increased abundance of invasive exotic species at the greenline may indicate susceptibility to invasive species due to high levels of disturbance (Winward 2000).\n\nGGW measurements provide insights into landscape-level changes over time, including sediment aggradation and the creation of wider stream networks. Improvements in habitat complexity within and along narrow, incised channels can be monitored through changing GGW and the rate at which these changes occur (Pollock et al. 2007).\n\nGreenline vegetation data collection follows a standardized procedure: measurements are taken in pairs on each side of the channel within a defined quadrat, allowing for comparisons against varying levels of dam and beaver influence along the reach. The specific location of each quadrat along the reach is also recorded to facilitate further analysis."
