  "abstract": " The Green Egg-to-Eyed Egg Survival method is a way to measure the number of eggs that develop into eyed eggs (an egg stage where embryos have developed eyes) out of the total number of eggs collected. This metric is important for fish farmers as it helps them monitor progress towards meeting production goals and identify any potential issues.\n\nBy calculating the percentage of green egg-to-eyed egg survival, fish farmers can assess the productivity of individual females or groups of eggs. A low percentage might indicate problems with achieving fish production targets based on the number of collected green eggs. On the other hand, a high percentage could mean an excess number of potential fish from the green egg collections.\n\nThe method's discretionary summarization level enables farmers to evaluate the data at different scales (individual female or entire production group). The Green Egg-to-Eyed Egg Survival method is a valuable tool for fish farming operations, ensuring optimal productivity and helping farmers make informed decisions.\n\nHere's an example calculation:\n1. Collect green eggs from females over multiple spawning days.\n2. Determine the number of eyed eggs that develop from the collected green eggs.\n3. Calculate the percentage of green egg-to-eyed egg survival by dividing the number of eyed eggs by the total number of green eggs collected.\n4. Use this percentage to assess individual female productivity, production group performance, and potential fish production goals achievement."

  "description": " In aquaculture, the metric of green egg-to-eyed egg survival is utilized to evaluate progress towards fish production objectives and for monitoring egg survival within a hatchery. This calculation can be applied at varying levels of aggregation, ranging from individual fish to entire production groups, which are often formed by collecting eggs on a single day or over multiple spawning days.\n\nThe green egg-to-eyed egg survival percentage represents the proportion of green eggs that have developed eyes during incubation. A low green egg-to-eyed egg survival rate (below the average facility rate of 90%) could indicate potential issues in meeting fish production targets based on the number of green eggs produced. Conversely, a high green egg-to-eyed egg survival percentage (above 90%) may suggest overproduction from the green egg collections.\n\nThis metric is valuable for assessing the success of individual females in producing viable offspring and for determining whether fish production goals, such as parr or smolts, will be met. The aggregation level at which this metric is reported depends on the discretion of the person analyzing the data. In summary, green egg-to-eyed egg survival is a crucial parameter in aquaculture used to assess and optimize fish production efficiency."

  "constraints": " Based on the provided text, the following constraints applicable to the \"Green egg-to-eyed egg survival\" method are identified:\n\n1. The method is used to monitor progress towards fish production goals and to track egg survival within a hatchery. (Lines 2-3, 6)\n2. The method can be applied at different summarization levels: individual fish or total number of eggs in a production group. (Lines 4-5, 10)\n3. The green egg-to-eyed egg percentages are used to determine the success of an individual female in producing offspring and as a metric for determining if fish production goals will be achieved. (Lines 7-9)\n4. The green egg-to-eyed egg survival rate should ideally be above a certain threshold (implicitly suggested to be around 90%) for successful fish production. (Lines 12-15)\n\nNo code is provided in the text, and thus there is no code generation needed."
