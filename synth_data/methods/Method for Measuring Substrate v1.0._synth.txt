2. Abstract: This method outlines the process of determining an appropriate substrate size and continuously monitoring changes in the percentage of fines and embeddedness at regular intervals along predetermined transects and sub-transects. This approach is crucial to ensuring a stable and sustainable substrate, preventing issues such as erosion or sedimentation.
3. Description: The method begins by establishing the size of the substrate, which forms the foundation for the monitoring process. At 10 equally spaced intervals along each transect and sub-transect, the percentage of fines (small particles) and embeddedness (the degree to which larger particles are anchored within the substrate) are measured and recorded. This process is repeated at each interval to track any significant changes over time, providing valuable data for managing and maintaining the substrate's integrity.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is on monitoring and evaluating substrate stability and health.
5. Constraints: This method requires regular access to the transects and sub-transects for data collection, as well as a reliable means of measuring fines percentage and embeddedness. Changes in environmental conditions or human activity may also impact the substrate and should be taken into account during monitoring.
