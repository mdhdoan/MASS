  "abstract": " The method described in the text aims to address the issue of non-native Brook Trout impacting native Westslope Cutthroat Trout populations in select streams. To reduce Brook Trout abundance, various removal methods have been applied, such as mechanical and chemical techniques. However, established Brook Trout populations can be challenging to control or eradicate.\n\nTo enhance these efforts, a novel approach called the Trojan Y Chromosome method is being used. This involves stocking male MYY (double-Y) Brook Trout into areas inhabited by non-native Brook Trout. These males produce only male offspring when they spawn with females from the target population.\n\nThe goal is to shift the sex ratio of the Brook Trout population towards males, ultimately leading to extirpation of Brook Trout and allowing cutthroat to reoccupy vacated habitat. This strategy is being tested in Mill Creek, which has undergone active Brook Trout suppression since 2018.\n\nAnnual genetic sampling of juveniles will inform the success of this project by determining if MYY Brook Trout have successfully spawned with the extant population and if male Brook Trout abundance is increasing as a result. This information will help evaluate the effectiveness of the approach and guide future strategies."

  "value": " Based on the text provided, here are some potential values that could be gained from investing in the MYY Brook Trout extirpation project:\n\n1. Protection of native Westslope Cutthroat Trout: By reducing the abundance of non-native Brook Trout through various removal methods and shifting the sex ratio towards males using the Trojan Y Chromosome method, the project aims to eventually extirpate Brook Trout from Mill Creek, allowing vacated habitat to be reoccupied by native cutthroat trout.\n2. Preservation of biodiversity: Native fish populations play an essential role in maintaining ecosystem health and function. The preservation of Westslope Cutthroat Trout in Mill Creek contributes to the overall biodiversity of the area.\n3. Restoration of habitat: Vacated habitat that was previously occupied by Brook Trout provides opportunities for cutthroat trout to expand their population and thrive.\n4. Scientific knowledge and advancement: The project involves the use of innovative methods, such as the Trojan Y Chromosome method, which could potentially be applied to other fish species and conservation efforts in the future. Additionally, annual genetic parentage analyses and evaluations provide valuable data on the success of the project and contribute to scientific knowledge on fish population dynamics.\n5. Economic benefits: The success of the project could lead to economic benefits, such as increased opportunities for recreational fishing and ecotourism in areas where native fish populations have been restored.\n\nTo determine if Myy Brook Trout have successfully spawned with the extant population, annual genetic parentage analyses will be conducted using tissue samples from juveniles. The sex ratio and male Brook Trout abundance will also be evaluated annually to determine if they are increasing as a result of successful Myy Brook Trout spawning with the extant population.\n\nHere is a simple Python code example for conducting genetic evaluation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data - assume we have collected tissue samples from 100 fish and determined their sex and genetic makeup\nsample_data = np.array([[0, 'M'], [1, 'F'], ..., [99, 'M']])\n\n# Calculate the number of males and females in the sample\nnum_males = np.sum(sample_data[:, 0] == 0)\nnum_females = len(sample_data) - num_males\n\n# Calculate the sex ratio (proportion of males to total fish)\nsex_ratio = num_males / len(sample_data)\n\nprint('Sex ratio:', sex_ratio)\n```\nHowever, note that this is a simplified example and actual genetic evaluation would involve more complex statistical analyses using software such as COLONY or GENEPOP."

  "problem_statement": " The problem the protocol is trying to solve is the presence and overabundance of non-native Brook Trout (BT) in select streams, which negatively impacts native Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WT) populations. The goal is to shift the sex ratio of the BT population towards males through the use of MYY male BT, with the eventual goal of extirpating the BT population and allowing WT to reoccupy vacated habitat. This is being done in Mill Creek as a pilot project, where approximately 3,000-4,000 MYYBT have been stocked annually since 2018. The success of this method is being evaluated through genetic sampling and analysis of juveniles to determine if MYYBT have successfully spawned with the extant population and if male BT abundance is increasing as a result."
}{
  "desired_outcomes": " The desired outcome stated in the protocol is to shift the sex ratio of a specific Brook Trout population towards male fish through the use of MYY (Male YY) Brook Trout stocks, ultimately leading to extirpation of the target population and allowing Westslope Cutthroat Trout to reoccupy vacated habitat in Mill Creek.\n\nTo monitor the progress and success of this project, annual genetic parentage analyses and evaluations are conducted:\n1. Genetic parentage analyses determine if MYY Brook Trout have successfully spawned with the extant population.\n2. Genetic evaluations estimate the sex ratio and determine if male Brook Trout abundance is increasing as a result of successive MYY Brook Trout spawning with the extant population."

  "description": " The text discusses efforts to reduce the population of non-native Brook Trout (BT) in select streams to benefit native Westslope Cutthroat Trout (cutthroat). Various methods, including mechanical and chemical removal, have been employed to decrease BT abundance. In Mill Creek, backpack electrofishing has been used extensively for BT control, but eradication can be challenging.\n\nTo enhance these traditional techniques, researchers aim to skew the sex ratio of the BT population through the Trojan Y Chromosome method. This approach involves stocking male Brook Trout (MYY) that possess two Y chromosomes instead of the typical XY. When MYY males mate with female Brook Trout from targeted populations, they produce offspring that are all male. Over time, continued stocking should result in a population consisting entirely of male fish and ultimately lead to extirpation.\n\nThe Idaho Fish and Game Department (IDFG) has developed MYYBrook Trout stocks and conducted simulations to assess the effectiveness of various MYYBrook Trout stocking strategies and levels of active suppression of existing populations (Schill et al., 2016, 2017). Following IDFG's initiative, trials of stocked MYYBrook Trout were initiated in several western states. Mill Creek was chosen as a pilot project due to ongoing Brook Trout suppression efforts by the Kalispel Tribe since 2018. Over 3,000-4,000 MYYBrook Trout have been stocked annually in Mill Creek since 2018.\n\nThe objective of this project is to observe if MYY contributes to shifting the population towards males, thereby expediting the extirpation of Brook Trout from Mill Creek and allowing cutthroat to eventually reoccupy over 30 km of vacated habitat. Genetic sampling of juveniles will provide information on the spawning success of stocked MYYBrook Trout and will be analyzed through annual genetic parentage analyses. Determining the sex ratio and evaluating male Brook Trout abundance trends will offer insights into the effectiveness of MYY's impact on the population.\n\nTo conduct annual genetic parentage analyses, researchers will examine tissue samples from juveniles to ascertain if MYYBrook Trout have successfully reproduced with the existing population. Additionally, they will perform annual genetic evaluations to estimate the sex ratio and determine if male Brook Trout abundance is increasing as a result of successful MYYBrook Trout spawning with the extant population.\n\nHere's some sample code for calculating the sex ratio:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data of female (x) and male (y) brook trout counts\nfemale_count = 100\nmale_count = 150\n\n# Total count\ntotal_count = female_count + male_count\n\n# Sex ratio calculation\nsex_ratio = np.abs(male_count - female_count) / total_count * 100\n\nprint(\"Sex Ratio: \", sex_ratio, \"%\")\n```"

  "constraints": " Based on the provided text, I identified the following constraints and their corresponding locations:\n\n1. **Established Brook Trout populations can be difficult to control or eradicate:** (Britton et al. 2010)\n2. **Shift the sex ratio of the Brook Trout population:** This constraint is inferred from the text as it describes using MYY males to spawn with female Brook Trout, aiming for a male-dominated population and eventual extirpation. (Gutierrez and Teem 2006; Teem and Gutierrez 2010; Schill et al. 2016, 2017)\n3. **Approximately 3,000-4,000 MYYBrook Trout have been stocked annually since 2018:** (Schill et al. 2017)\n4. **Genetic tissue sampling of juveniles:** (annual genetic parentage analyses and annual genetic evaluation)\n\nThese constraints relate to the method used to reduce Brook Trout populations in Mill Creek by introducing MYYBrook Trout, which aims to shift the sex ratio towards males and ultimately lead to extirpation. The first constraint highlights that established Brook Trout populations can be challenging to control or eradicate using traditional methods, necessitating alternative approaches like this one. The second constraint is inherent in the method itself, as the goal is to produce an all-male population to eventually replace the current one and push out native Westslope Cutthroat Trout. The third constraint specifies the number of MYYBrook Trout stocked annually since 2018. Lastly, genetic tissue sampling is a crucial part of monitoring the progress of this method, informing the success of MYYBrook Trout spawning and assessing the sex ratio's change over time.\n\nNo code was generated as no specific code was requested."
