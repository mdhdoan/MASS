 1. Abstract: The text outlines a protocol for monitoring and evaluating the survival and migration patterns of sockeye salmon smolts in the Sawtooth Basin lakes. Trapping at lake outlets provides information on smolt sizes, timing of out-migration, and overwinter survival. This data is used to inform management decisions regarding the placement of future captive broodstock progeny and the evaluation of different release strategies. The ability to capture and tag juvenile sockeye during downstream migration allows for monitoring survival to the first hydrosystem dam and the development of adult return forecasts.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: The value in this protocol comes from the ability to monitor and evaluate the success of restoration efforts for sockeye salmon populations in the Sawtooth Basin lakes. The problem being addressed is the need for information on overwinter survival and out-migration patterns of sockeye salmon smolts to inform management decisions and improve restoration efforts. The desired outcome is to make informed decisions regarding release strategies and placement of future captive broodstock progeny, leading to improved sockeye salmon populations in the Sawtooth Basin lakes.
3. Description: The protocol outlined in the text involves trapping at lake outlets to monitor and evaluate the out-migration patterns and survival of sockeye salmon smolts in the Sawtooth Basin lakes. This includes monitoring the timing of out-migration, smolt sizes, overwinter survival, and natural production of sockeye salmon in the lakes. The data collected from trapping is used to inform management decisions regarding release strategies and the placement of future captive broodstock progeny. The ability to capture and tag juvenile sockeye during downstream migration allows for monitoring survival to the first hydrosystem dam and the development of adult return forecasts.
4. Objectives: The objective of this protocol is to evaluate the success of different release strategies and inform management decisions regarding the placement of future captive broodstock progeny in the Sawtooth Basin lakes. This objective covers the entire problem statement, as the need for information on out-migration patterns and survival of sockeye salmon smolts is being addressed. Keywords related to this objective include: monitoring, out-migration, survival, release strategies, management decisions, captive broodstock progeny, and Sawtooth Basin lakes.
5. Target: The primary focus of this protocol is the evaluation of different release strategies and informing management decisions for sockeye salmon restoration efforts in the Sawtooth Basin lakes.
6. Constraints: There are no specific constraints mentioned in the text, but it is important to note that the success of this protocol relies on adequate funding, resources, and cooperation from relevant stakeholders.
