2. Abstract: This method describes a technique to process raw detection data from the Juvenile Salmonid Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS). It uses rulesets to identify and remove multipath detections and false positives, filtering them based on tag ID, expected battery life, tag pulse rate, and tag frequency. This method was initially developed in MatLAB by Arnold Ammann from NOAA SWFSC and has been since adapted by Taylor Spaulding into an R package for broader accessibility and use.
3. Description: The text details a filtering method used to clean raw detection data obtained from JSATS receivers. This is achieved through the application of rulesets, which help in detecting and removing multipath detections as well as false positives. Specific criteria are applied for filtering these detections: tag ID, expected battery life, tag pulse rate, and tag frequency. The method was initially developed by Arnold Ammann from NOAA SWFSC using MatLAB code, which was then converted into an R package by Taylor Spaulding to enhance its reach and utility.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to refine raw detection data from JSATS receivers by filtering out multipath detections and false positives.
5. Constraints: There may be limitations in the applicability of this method based on the quality of initial detection data, accuracy of tag information, and compatibility with specific research contexts or systems.
