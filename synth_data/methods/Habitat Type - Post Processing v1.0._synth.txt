 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the five highly relevant keywords that I have identified from the text body:

1. Habitat types
2. Data collection
3. Polyline and polygon formats
4. Channel size
5. Flow levels

Now, let me provide the remaining sections based on the given information:

2. Abstract:
Habitat type identification is a crucial method for evaluating stream health and fish populations. This process involves the collection of physical characteristics in the environment that are relevant to salmonids' perspective of the stream. Due to the high level of heterogeneity in habitat types, initial data collection can be labor-intensive, requiring field practitioners to walk each reach and record habitat types using GPS technology. The format used for recording habitat types depends on the channel size and data collection precision. This method aims to provide an accurate representation of relative habitat abundances for a stream section.
3. Description:
The text describes a method for identifying and measuring habitat types in aquatic systems, specifically for salmonids' perspective. The process begins with data collection, which involves physically walking each reach and using GPS technology to geo-reference each habitat type. Afterwards, the GPS data is post-processed to create a map of the reach. Habitat types can be recorded in one of two formats: polyline or polygon. A polyline format is used for channels less than 20m bankfull width, while a polygon format is used for larger channels. The choice of format depends on the channel size and data collection precision. All months are rated equally, with moderate flow levels assumed. Habitat types are entered as a point estimate of the percentage of the stream reach wetted width for the particular habitat type.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide an accurate representation of relative habitat abundances for a stream section, which can help evaluate stream health and fish populations.
5. Constraints:
This method requires labor-intensive data collection, as field practitioners must physically walk each reach and use GPS technology to geo-reference each habitat type. Additionally, the choice of format (polyline or polygon) depends on channel size and data collection precision. The method assumes moderate flow levels for rating this attribute, although it is recognized that the relative amount of this habitat type can change over a wide range of flow levels.
