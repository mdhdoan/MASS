2. Abstract: This method outlines a process for classifying and measuring various types of pools in a waterway, including scour, dam, and plunge pools. By accurately categorizing and quantifying these features, researchers can better understand the morphology and hydraulics of the waterway, informing management and conservation efforts.
3. Description: The method begins by defining the criteria for each pool type based on their dimensions and features. For scour and dam pools, length is greater than width, while plunge pools have a shorter length than width, with a vertical drop at the head crest. Sampling involves measuring the pool's length, maximum depth, and tail crest depth, as well as identifying its formation type (scour, dam, or plunge). Pool tail crest depth is measured differently depending on whether the flow is going over or around an obstruction. The method focuses on accurately categorizing and quantifying pool habitats, which aids in understanding waterway morphology and hydraulics for management purposes.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to provide a systematic approach for classifying, measuring, and understanding the different types of pools found within waterways.
5. Constraints: Potential constraints include difficulty in accurately identifying pool boundaries or categorizing complex pool formations. Additionally, accessing some pools may require specialized equipment or training due to depth or water conditions.
