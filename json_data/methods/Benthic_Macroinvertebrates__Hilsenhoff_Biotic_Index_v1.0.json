  "abstractText": "The Hilsenhoff Biotic index (Hilsenhoff 1988) is based on pollution tolerance values for benthic macroinvertebrate families and is used to help determine environmental quality at a site. Each taxa is assigned a value between 0 and 10; the higher the proportion of pollution-tolerant organisms present, the more likely it is that the site is impacted by pollution. This index was originally developed using samples from riffle habitats.",
