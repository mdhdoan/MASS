  "abstractText": "Life-history strategies can buffer individual fish and populations of fish from environmental variability. And time spent in freshwater and saltwater is often used when characterizing the life-history diversity of anadromous salmonids. Calcified structures, including otoliths, scales, vertebrae, spines, and opercular bones are examined to age and interpret life-history strategies in fish populations. With scales being one of the oldest and most common calcified structures used for assigning ages to salmonids.",
