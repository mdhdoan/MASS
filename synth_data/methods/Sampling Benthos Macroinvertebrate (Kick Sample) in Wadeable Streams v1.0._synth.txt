2. Abstract: This method explains the process of collecting benthic macroinvertebrate samples to evaluate biological integrity and ecological quality in waded streams. The data collected is used to describe taxonomic loss and requires the measurement of associated physical and chemical environmental variables. This method contributes to watershed health and salmon recovery efforts by providing a standardized protocol for community level assessments.
3. Description: The primary focus of this method is to outline the process of collecting benthic macroinvertebrate samples in waded streams. The purpose of these collections is to describe biological integrity and ecological quality, or taxonomic loss, as an indicator of watershed health and salmon recovery. This method requires the measurement of associated physical and chemical environmental variables described in other methods within the Environmental Assessment Program Washington State Department of Ecology, Status and Trends Monitoring for Watershed Health & Salmon Recovery: Field Data Collection Protocol- Wadeable Streams.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a standardized protocol for collecting benthic macroinvertebrate samples in waded streams as part of community level assessments.
5. Constraints: This method requires the measurement of associated physical and chemical environmental variables, which may require additional resources and expertise. Additionally, this method only applies to waded streams, limiting its applicability to other types of aquatic environments.
