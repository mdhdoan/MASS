  "abstract": " This method is used to measure the weight of live fish accurately. It's applicable to various fish species. The process involves gently removing excess water from the fish before taking the measurement. This step helps minimize errors by ensuring a consistent comparison between the fish's weight and the measuring scale, ultimately providing an accurate wet weight for the fish."

  "description": " The text describes a method used for obtaining the wet weight of live fish species. This technique is versatile and can be applied to various fish types. To minimize measurement errors, an essential step involves gently eliminating excess water from the fish before weighing. This process ensures accurate results by reducing the impact of water volume fluctuations on the weight measurement.\n\nIn more technical terms, the procedure commences with removing live fish specimens from their aquatic environment. Following this, any adhering water is carefully eliminated to acquire a more precise estimation of their actual body mass. The method's success lies in its ability to address the inherent issue of water content variation in fish weight assessments.\n\nThis technique is crucial for accurate research, breeding programs, and commercial fishing industries where weighing live fish is required. By meticulously implementing this method, one can ensure that the measured weight of live fish closely approximates their true body mass, making the data more reliable and valuable."
