  "abstractText": "This method explains how to collect a site-composite sediment sample. Stream sites are sampled within day-long data collection events (DCEs). Eachcomposite sample will be composed of scoops taken from 3 separately-located shallow-waterstations in the site. To detect the presence of select contaminants at the site, the sample will beanalyzed for metals (copper, lead, zinc, arsenic) and a standard list of polynuclear aromatichydrocarbon (PAH) compounds. To help interpret the results, the sample will also be analyzedfor total organic carbonand grain size composition.",
