  "abstractText": "These cruises are part of a long-termBonnevillePower Administration-funded effort by academic and federal scientists to understand coastal ecosystems and biological and physical processes that may influence recruitment variability of salmon in Pacific Northwest waters. Presently, research is focused on examining the effects of biotic andabioticenvironmental conditions on the early marine life history of coho and Chinook salmon. This research focused on the Columbia River Plume and its importance for juvenile salmon and highertrophiclevel predators because this is an area of highsalmonidabundance and it is influenced by anthropogenic factors.",
