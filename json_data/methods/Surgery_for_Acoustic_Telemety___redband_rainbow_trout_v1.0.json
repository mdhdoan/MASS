  "abstractText": "The current goal is to conserve, enhance and restore redband trout populations in Lake Roosevelt, and where appropriate, provide opportunities for subsistence harvest by Native American Tribes and recreational harvest. Reservoir operations, particularly entrainment, have been identified as primary factors limiting recruitment of rainbow trout and kokanee salmon to the fishery in Lake Roosevelt. Acoustic tracking will be used to assess distribution patterns and entrainment of wild redband trout in Lake Roosevelt and the upper Columbia River. We will assess tributary fidelity. We will use V7, V9 and V13 Vemco transmitters, maintaining tags that are < 5% total body weight (Brown et al. 1999). Transmitter lifespan increases with battery size (and thus size) allowing us to assess longer periods of movement for larger trout.",
