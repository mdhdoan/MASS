2. Abstract:
   Natural Origin Spawner Abundance (NOSA) is a Viable Salmonid Population (VSP) indicator used to inform NOAA management decisions regarding the extinction risk of salmonid populations. The Interior Columbia Technical Review Team (ICTRT) utilizes VSP indicators to evaluate the current status of these populations, ensuring their sustainability and preservation.

3. Description:
   NOSA is an essential VSP indicator employed by the ICTRT for assessing the extinction risk of salmonid populations in the Interior Columbia region. The ICTRT uses this information to inform NOAA management decisions regarding these species' conservation and management strategies. By evaluating NOSA, the ICTRT can effectively monitor and manage salmonid populations and ensure their continued existence and well-being.

4. Target:
   The primary focus of the NOSA method is to serve as a VSP indicator for assessing the current status and extinction risk of salmonid populations in the Interior Columbia region, ultimately guiding NOAA management decisions for their conservation and preservation.

5. Constraints:
   The success of the NOSA method as a VSP indicator depends on accurate data collection, analysis, and interpretation by the ICTRT. Potential constraints include limited resources, inadequate data availability, and challenges associated with monitoring and evaluating salmonid populations' status and trends accurately.
