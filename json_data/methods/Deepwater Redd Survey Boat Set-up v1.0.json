  "abstractText": "Since 1991, redds constructed by fall Chinook salmon in the Snake River have counted by helicopter or unmanned aerial systems (UAS, aka drones). However, redds can only be seen from the air to a depth of about 3 m. Because fish also construct redds in deeper water, alternative means are used to count redds in water ranging from 3 to 9 m deep. This is accomplished by counting deepwater redds using an underwater camera deployed from a boat at know deepwater spawning sites.",
