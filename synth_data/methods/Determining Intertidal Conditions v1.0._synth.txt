2. Abstract:
This method focuses on tracking and evaluating the health of intertidal habitats within SRFB acquired lands. By monitoring marine vegetation, specifically marine algae and rooted vascular plants, in terms of species diversity and density, this approach offers insights into changes since the base year. Additionally, beach slope and fines monitoring help assess shifts in physical conditions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of intertidal zone health.

3. Description:
The methodology begins with delineating major vegetation polygons in the intertidal zone to define specific areas for study. Once these zones are established, field evaluation is conducted on intertidal vegetation polygons, allowing researchers to assess their ecological status and changes over time. A crucial element of this process involves establishing transects and plot locations to ensure consistent monitoring and comparative analysis. This comprehensive approach helps protect juvenile salmon habitats by addressing the necessity for ongoing evaluation and conservation efforts in SRFB acquired lands with significant intertidal zones.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is evaluating the health and changes in intertidal habitats, particularly marine vegetation, to ensure their preservation within SRFB acquired lands.

5. Constraints:
Potential constraints for this method include limited accessibility to certain intertidal zones, difficulty in consistently defining and delineating polygons, variability in weather conditions affecting field evaluations, and the need for specialized equipment and expertise in marine botany and ecology.
