2. Abstract: The advancement of technology has enabled the development of multi-parameter water quality meters that can measure various parameters simultaneously, providing a more efficient and accurate way to assess water quality. This method of using a calibrated multi-parameter water quality meter is used for short-term, discrete measurements of depth profiles for temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and conductivity in the field. The data obtained from these measurements are crucial in determining the extent of stratification and the availability of suitable temperature range and level of DO necessary to support aquatic life. This method is essential in ensuring the health of aquatic ecosystems by providing real-time, accurate data on various water quality parameters.

3. Description: The text describes a method for measuring water quality using a multi-parameter water quality meter (or sonde) that can house multiple sensors to take simultaneous readings for temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and conductivity. This instrumentation is used in the field for short-term, discrete measurements of depth profiles. The data collected from these measurements are used to determine the extent of stratification and the availability of appropriate temperature range and level of DO necessary to support aquatic life. A calibrated multi-parameter water quality meter provides real-time, accurate data on various water quality parameters that can be used for decision making in managing aquatic resources.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide an efficient and accurate way of measuring water quality using a multi-parameter water quality meter for short-term, discrete measurements of depth profiles for temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and conductivity.

5. Constraints: This method requires access to the field, proper calibration of the multi-parameter water quality meter, and knowledge in interpreting data obtained from this instrumentation.
