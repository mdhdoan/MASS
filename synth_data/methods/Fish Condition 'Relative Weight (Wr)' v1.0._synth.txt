2. Abstract: This method discusses the importance of monitoring the condition of fish species in fisheries surveys to understand their health and population status. Traditional methods like Fulton condition factors have limitations, as they are only suitable for comparing fish of similar lengths due to allometric growth. The proposed solution is the use of relative weight (Wr) as a more accurate metric. Each species has its own precalculated Ws equation, derived from a wide range of individual populations throughout a geography, making it a robust and widely applicable method for assessing fish condition.
3. Description: Fish condition monitoring is crucial in fisheries surveys to assess the health and population dynamics of various species. Traditionally, Fulton condition factors have been used; however, they only allow comparison between fish of similar lengths due to allometric growth (Wege and Anderson 1978). To address this limitation, the method proposes using relative weight (Wr) instead, which eliminates these issues. The Wr for a specific species is calculated using its unique Ws equation, derived from numerous individual populations throughout a wide geographic range (Murphy et al. 1990; Blackwell et al. 2000; Bister et al. 2000). This approach ensures accurate and consistent comparisons between fish of different sizes and species.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to provide a standardized, accurate, and widely applicable technique for monitoring the condition of various fish species in fisheries surveys.
5. Constraints: While the Ws equation-based approach offers several advantages over traditional methods, it requires access to precalculated Ws equations specific to each target species. Additionally, proper application demands a solid understanding of allometric growth and its impact on fish condition metrics.
