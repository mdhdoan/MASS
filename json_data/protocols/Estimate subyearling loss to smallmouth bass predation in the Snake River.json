  "background": "Predation by nonnative predators is a potential risk to subyearling fall Chinook salmon that rear in, and migrate through, lower Snake River reservoirs.With the implementation of hatchery supplementation and increase in natural production, the abundance of subyearlings is far greater today than it was 15 years ago when the last subyearling predation studies were done in the Snake River. It is currently unknown whether smallmouth bass abundance has increased in response to the increasing population of juvenile salmon and whether predation has increased as a consequence. It is possible that predation may pose a significant risk to subyearlings and may reduce the productivity of the Snake River basin population. It is also unknown to what extent channel catfish prey on subyearlings in Lower Granite Reservoir.",

  "assumptions": "<p>1.&nbsp; The diets of collected smallmouth bass and channel catfish will be representative of the population at large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp; Bias between different predator collection methods will be minimal or can be accounted for in analyses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp; Sufficient numbers of smallmouth bass can be marked and recaptured to accurately estimate their abundance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Smallmouth bass abundance can be accurately expanded to the larger study area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
