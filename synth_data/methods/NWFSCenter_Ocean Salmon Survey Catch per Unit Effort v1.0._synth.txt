2. Abstract:
The Bonneville Power Administration funds a long-term effort by academic and federal scientists to study coastal ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest, focusing on how biotic and abiotic environmental conditions affect coho and Chinook salmon early marine life history. The research highlights the importance of the Columbia River Plume as an area of high salmonid abundance that is influenced by human factors. By understanding these processes, better management strategies can be developed to support salmon recruitment variability.

3. Description:
This study, funded by the Bonneville Power Administration, brings together academic and federal scientists with a focus on investigating coastal ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. The primary objective is to understand the biological and physical processes that may influence recruitment variability of salmon, specifically coho and Chinook species. Research currently focuses on examining the effects of biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) environmental conditions on the early marine life history of these salmon types. The Columbia River Plume has been identified as a crucial area for this research due to its high abundance of salmonids and influence from anthropogenic factors (human activities).

4. Target:
The main goal is to understand how biotic and abiotic environmental conditions in the Pacific Northwest waters affect coho and Chinook salmon early marine life history, with a particular focus on the Columbia River Plume.

5. Constraints:
The success of this research may be influenced by various constraints, such as limitations in data collection, changes in funding, potential gaps in scientific knowledge, and unpredictable environmental or human factors affecting the Columbia River Plume and its salmonid populations.
