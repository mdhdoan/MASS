2. Abstract: This method outlines a process for surveying watersheds using topographic maps to identify potential sample sites. The sites are selected in numerical order, with existing survey sites being repeated and new sites added as needed. This approach ensures consistent data collection across all surveys while allowing for flexibility in adding new sample locations.
3. Description: The method begins by providing a topographic map of each watershed, marked with potential sample sites. For watershed re-surveys, existing survey sites are repeated in numerical order from lowest to highest number. In cases where additional sites need to be added, the process involves selecting new sites in numerical order, starting with number 1. This approach ensures a systematic and organized method for surveying watersheds, while allowing for flexibility in adding new sample locations as needed.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a standardized and flexible approach for surveying watersheds by selecting potential sample sites in numerical order.
5. Constraints: This method requires access to topographic maps of each watershed and the ability to identify potential sample sites on those maps. Additionally, the success of this method depends on the availability of existing survey data and the need for additional sites in each watershed.
