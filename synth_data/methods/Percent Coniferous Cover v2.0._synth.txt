* Coniferous cover
* Transects
* Understory
* Canopy
* Visual estimation

2. Abstract:
This method describes a procedure for estimating the percentage of coniferous cover in a given area. Five transects are placed on both the right and left banks within a 10mx10m plot, beginning at bankfull. The percent of the understory and canopy covered by woody conifers is visually estimated for each plot. The final estimate of conifer coverage is an average of the estimates from all ten plots. This method allows researchers to quickly and easily assess the amount of coniferous cover in a given area using visual estimation.

3. Description:
The text outlines a method for estimating the percentage of coniferous cover in a given area. The method involves placing five transects on both the right and left banks within a 10mx10m plot, beginning at bankfull. For each plot, the percent of the understory and canopy covered by woody conifers is visually estimated. The visual estimation is subjective and depends on the observer's judgement. The final estimate of conifer coverage is calculated as an average of all ten plots. This method allows researchers to assess the amount of coniferous cover in a given area without the need for more complex or time-consuming survey methods.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to provide a quick and easy way to estimate the percentage of coniferous cover in a given area.

5. Constraints:
This method relies on visual estimation, which can be subjective and prone to errors depending on the observer's judgement. Additionally, the method only assesses coniferous cover and does not provide information on other types of vegetation or land cover.
