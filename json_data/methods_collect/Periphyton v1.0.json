  "abstractText": "Periphyton are the algae, fungi, bacteria, and protozoa associated with substrates inaquatic habitats. These organisms exhibit high diversity and are a major component inenergy flow and nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems. Many characteristics of periphytonassemblage structure and function can be used to develop indicators of ecological conditionsin streams (Stevenson and Bahls 1999, Hill et al. 2000). Periphyton are sensitive tomany environmental conditions, which can be detected by changes in species composition,cell density, ash free dry mass (AFDM), chlorophyll a, and enzyme activity (e.g., alkalineand acid phosphatase). Each of these characteristics may be used, singly or in concert, toassess condition with respect to societal values such as biological integrity and trophiccondition.Condition indicators developed from periphyton assemblage data involve the calculation of composite indices for biotic integrity, ecological sustainability, and trophic condition. The composite indices can be calculated from measured or derived first-order and second-order indices. The first-order indices include species composition (richness, diversity), cell density, AFDM, chlorophyll, and enzyme activity (e.g., Sayler et al. 1979), which individually are indicators of ecological condition in streams. Second-order indices can be calculated from periphyton assemblage characteristics, such as the autotrophic index (Weber 1973), assemblage similarity compared to reference sites, and autecological indices (e.g., Lowe 1974, Lange-Bertalot 1979, Charles 1985, Dixit et al. 1992, Potapova et al. 2004). Hill et al. (2000, 2003), Fore (2002), and Wang et al. (2005) describe the development of multimetric indexes based on periphyton assemblages in wadeable streams.",
