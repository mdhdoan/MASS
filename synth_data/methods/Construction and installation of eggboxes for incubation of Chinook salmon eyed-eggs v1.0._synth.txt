2. Abstract: This method describes the use of remote site incubators (RSIs) as a low-cost and effective alternative to traditional hatchery production for salmonid supplementation programs. Specifically, this text focuses on the application of RSIs, in the form of eggboxes, for the reestablishment of Chinook salmon populations. By providing an artificial environment that mimics natural conditions for eggs and emerging fry, RSIs help increase egg-to-fry survival, reduce negative fitness effects from domestic selection, and promote natal homing abilities in released fish.
3. Description: Salmonid supplementation aims to maintain or enhance natural production while minimizing ecological and genetic impacts on non-target populations. This is particularly crucial for at-risk or underpopulated salmonid species, such as Chinook salmon. Traditional hatchery techniques, although effective in increasing population size, can be expensive and may limit natural selection for survival traits. RSIs offer a more cost-effective and ecologically sound alternative by exposing eggs and fry to natural rearing conditions while reducing negative fitness effects associated with domestic selection. Eggboxes, a type of RSI, are specifically designed for Chinook salmon supplementation programs. By constructing, installing, and monitoring eggboxes filled with eyed-eggs, managers can protect eggs, promote hatching, and allow volitional release of swim-up fry into the stream. This method has shown promising results in improving the success of Chinook salmon supplementation efforts.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a detailed overview and guide for implementing remote site incubators, specifically eggboxes, as an effective tool for Chinook salmon supplementation programs.
5. Constraints: Despite their benefits, RSIs like eggboxes may still face certain limitations or constraints, including:
* Site selection: Choosing appropriate locations with suitable hydrological and environmental conditions for RSI placement.
* Maintenance: Regular monitoring and upkeep of RSIs to ensure proper function and minimize potential issues (e.g., predation, debris accumulation).
* Costs: While generally lower than traditional hatchery methods, initial setup costs and ongoing maintenance expenses may still need to be considered.
* Regulatory compliance: Ensuring adherence to local, regional, or national regulations governing the use of artificial propagation techniques in conservation efforts.
