 1. Keywords: White Sturgeon, biological data collection, stock assessment surveys, UCWSRI 2006
2. Abstract: This method is crucial for collecting essential biological data from White Sturgeon during general stock assessment surveys (UCWSRI 2006). The process involves specific steps to ensure accurate data acquisition while minimizing stress and harm to the captured fish. The method's implementation contributes significantly to monitoring and managing White Sturgeon populations, ultimately aiding in their conservation.
3. Description: This method details the procedures for collecting biological data from White Sturgeon captured during stock assessment surveys (UCWSRI 2006). Data collection includes measurements of length, weight, fin clips, and scale samples. These procedures ensure proper handling, minimize stress, and maintain the safety of the captured sturgeons while providing valuable information for population monitoring and management. The method's specificity to White Sturgeon allows for accurate data gathering tailored to this species' unique characteristics and needs.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to establish a standardized procedure for collecting biological data from captured White Sturgeon during stock assessment surveys.
5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method include limitations in resources, such as equipment or personnel availability, and the need for specialized training to handle and collect data from large, potentially dangerous fish species like the White Sturgeon. Additionally, environmental factors, such as water temperature, flow rates, and visibility, may impact the effectiveness and safety of the data collection process.
