2. Abstract:
The survival rate of woody plant species is an essential indicator of the success of planting initiatives. This method proposes surveying the survival of these species one year and three years after planting to assess planting success. By monitoring their progress over time, this approach provides insights into the effectiveness of planting efforts and helps identify potential improvement areas.

3. Description:
The text discusses a method for evaluating the success of woody plant species survival after planting. This involves conducting surveys at two critical time pointsâ€”one year and three years post-planting. These surveys will help assess the health, growth, and overall success of the planting project. The data collected from these surveys can be used to identify challenges and optimize future planting strategies for improved survival rates.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to determine the success of woody plant species survival after planting by conducting surveys at one-year and three-year intervals.

5. Constraints:
Possible constraints for this method may include limited resources, such as funding or personnel, to carry out the surveys. Additionally, environmental factors like weather conditions, natural disasters, or pests could impact the survival rates of woody plant species, making it challenging to accurately measure the success of the planting initiatives.
