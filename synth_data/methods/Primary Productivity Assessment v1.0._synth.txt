 1. Keywords: Primary productivity, carbon uptake, size fractionation, chlorophyll concentrations, grazing pressure.

2. Abstract: This method addresses the challenge of accurately assessing primary productivity by measuring carbon uptake rates directly. Traditional methods using chlorophyll concentrations, standing phytoplankton density, or biovolume have limitations as they may not accurately reflect changes in primary production due to factors like grazing pressure. The innovative size fractionation approach enables differentiation of production from various plankton communities, providing a more precise and detailed understanding of primary productivity.

3. Description: Primary productivity is a critical aspect of aquatic ecosystems, yet traditional methods of assessment have limitations. Chlorophyll concentrations, standing phytoplankton density, or biovolume do not always accurately reflect changes in primary production. This is because changes in grazing pressure can mask or exaggerate primary productivity. The best way to assess primary production is to measure carbon uptake rates directly. This method describes a new approach for measuring primary production in terms of carbon uptake by the phytoplankton community. Size fractionation is used to differentiate production from the pico, nano, and microplankton communities, providing a more detailed and precise understanding of primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to accurately assess primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems by measuring carbon uptake rates directly and using size fractionation to differentiate production from various plankton communities.

5. Constraints: This method requires specialized equipment and expertise to measure carbon uptake rates and perform size fractionation. Additionally, the method may be time-consuming and resource-intensive compared to traditional methods of assessing primary productivity.
