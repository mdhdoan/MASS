2. Abstract: Cumulative-frequency distributions (CFD) are an alternative way to visualize length-frequency histograms and are used in certain statistical tests to compare two or more distributions. This method is necessary because similar mean lengths between two strata can mask significant differences in the underlying distribution of lengths. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, a non-parametric test, is employed to analyze variations in length distributions across different groups, providing a valuable tool for statistical analysis.
3. Description: CFDs are used as an alternative view of length-frequency histograms and are utilized in some statistical tests that compare two or more distributions. The necessity for this method arises from the possibility of mean lengths between two strata being equal while the underlying distribution of lengths can be significantly different. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, a non-parametric test, is used to examine differences in length distributions across various groups. This test is particularly useful as it does not require any assumptions about the data's distribution or parameters, making it applicable to a wide range of situations.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a tool for comparing and analyzing length distributions between different groups, with an emphasis on non-parametric testing.
5. Constraints: The main constraint for this method is its reliance on the availability and accuracy of length data from the different groups being compared. Additionally, it assumes that the lengths are independent observations within each group.
