2. Abstract: Length measurements from specific parts of a fish are crucial when intact specimens are unavailable due to spawning or death. This method removes bias associated with eroded tails in female spawners by using the mid-eye to posterior scale (MEPS) measurement, which is taken from the orbit to the hypural plate, an area of modified vertebrae supporting the caudal fin rays. This technique enhances accuracy when comparing fish lengths across various groups.
3. Description: The text discusses a method for measuring the length of fish when intact specimens are not available, particularly in cases where female spawners have eroded tails due to redd excavation or hatchery-raised females are being compared with carcasses. A bias-free comparison is achieved by using specific length measurements from intact body parts such as the orbit and hypural plate. The hypural plate, a series of modified vertebrae at the posterior end of the vertebral column, provides support for the caudal fin rays. Researchers typically use MEPS (mid-eye to posterior scale) when measuring length, which involves taking the measurement from the orbit to an external feature when the hypural plate is not visible.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to ensure accurate fish length comparisons, removing bias caused by eroded tails or other damage in spawning or dead specimens.
5. Constraints: The main constraint for this method is the necessity of specific body parts remaining intact and undamaged in order to perform these measurements accurately.
