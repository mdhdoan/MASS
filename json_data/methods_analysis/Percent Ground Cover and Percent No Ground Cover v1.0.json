Percent of the areal coverage of groundcover (<0.5 m) is visually estimated for each plot.Percent GroundCover is an average of the estimates from each of these 10 plots. Percent GroundcoverNoCover is100-Percent GroundCover.The CHaMP - Riparian Structure Method provides background on the measurements that are analyzed for this calculation.
