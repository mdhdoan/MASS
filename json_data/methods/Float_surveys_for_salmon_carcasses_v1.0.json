  "abstractText": "Salmon carcasses retrieved from spawning grounds can provide important data for research and monitoring applications. With suitable data collection methods, assessments can be made regarding: spawning escapement; pre-spawn mortality and egg retention; demographic characteristics; genotypic and phenotypic traits; stray rates; and spawning composition (ratio of hatchery- tonatural-origin spawners). Spawning grounds must be surveyed during the spawning season, to allow for the collection of carcasses. This method deals only with the survey/collection of salmon carcasses from spawning grounds. See other methods for data collection relating to further assessments of collected carcasses (e.g., biological sampling, tag/mark interrogations).",
