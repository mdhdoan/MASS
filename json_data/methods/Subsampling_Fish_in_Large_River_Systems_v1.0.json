  "abstractText": "If too many specimens are collected for timely identification and measurement in the field, specimens may either be preserved in a fixative for enumeration later, or a subsample may be selected for measurement followed by enumeration or estimation of the remaining sample. Subsampling is defined as taking a representative manageable sample from a larger (unmanageable) sample (Ratcliff et al. 2014). Subsampling is necessary to keep fish alive and to keep sampling time manageable (Ratcliff et al. 2014).",
