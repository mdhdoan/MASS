  "abstractText": "Shoreline spawning habitat is monitored to assess the influence of lake level management(e.g., winter minimum pool elevations, and winter fluctuations)on quality of lakeshore spawning habitat. Wind and wave action can shift spawning gravel both horizontally and vertically as well as drive fine sediment distribution. The distribution of these two types of substratecan affect egg incubation success for spawning fish. Therefore, we monitor habitat conditions at standardized shoreline sites to better understand the effects of winter dam operations have on shoreline spawning habitat.",
