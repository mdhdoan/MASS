2. Abstract: This paper discusses a novel method for modeling salmon population dynamics using the R programming language. The model employs the Beverton-Holt spawner-recruit framework and incorporates user-defined inputs for various life stages, uncertainty in parameter estimates, and stochasticity to account for natural variability. The model's unique features include the ability to simulate hatchery fish introductions, incorporate spatial correlations among input parameters, and represent time-based trends in watershed management practices. These innovations enable more accurate representation of salmon population dynamics than previous models.
3. Description: A salmon population dynamics model has been developed using the R programming language, implementing the Beverton-Holt spawner-recruit model (Beverton and Holt 1957). The model includes user-defined inputs for life stages, uncertainty in parameter estimates, and stochasticity. User-specified levels of stochasticity are used to estimate both parametric uncertainties and natural temporal, spatial, and pure variability. Natural correlations among input parameters are maintained through structured correlation structures, making the model more reflective of actual processes compared to assuming independence across all parameters. The model allows for time-based trends and step function changes in user-defined parameters, such as watershed management practices or dam operations, leading to gradual increases in forested lands or shifts in seasonal water flows. Multiple sites can be concurrently modeled, accounting for site dependencies, cross-site migration, and enabling summarization of results at various spatial levels. The model is flexible enough to handle different species of salmonids, including steelhead with complex life cycles.
4. Target: Accurate and comprehensive representation of salmon population dynamics, considering various factors affecting their abundance and distribution.
5. Constraints: The effectiveness of this method depends on the quality and accuracy of user-defined inputs, including uncertainty estimates in parameter estimates and spatial correlations among input parameters. Time-based trends and step function changes also rely on accurate representation of external factors influencing salmon populations.
