  "abstract": " In order to understand the impact of northern pikeminnow, smallmouth bass, and walleye on juvenile salmonids above McNary Dam on the Columbia River, we will collect and analyze their diets. This information is crucial as these non-native predator fish are contributing significantly to the mortality of rearing and migrating juvenile salmonids due to overlapping temporal and spatial habitats.\n\nTo gather the necessary data, we will use a combination of methods including boat electrofishing. The reasoning behind this choice is that electrofishing allows for effective capture of these species in their aquatic environments without causing harm to them or disrupting their habitats. Once captured, the fish will be humanely euthanized and their stomachs will be examined to determine their diet composition via lavage and dissection.\n\nIn order to ensure that our data is representative of the entire year, we will collect samples twice during different time periods. The first collection will occur in the first half of May to represent the dietary intake of age-1 chinook, sockeye, Coho, and steelhead smolt. This group consists of yearling salmonids that are particularly vulnerable to predation. The second collection will take place in early to mid-June to capture the dietary habits of age-0 Chinook smolt during their outmigration phase (subyearlings).\n\nTo further understand and quantify the consumption rates of these predator fish on juvenile salmonids, we will employ the Fish Bioenergetics 4.0 mass balance bioenergetics model. This model utilizes key parameters such as predator growth rate, diet composition, prey energy density (joules/g) from literature values, and water temperature of the predators' environment to calculate the consumption of each prey type by each predator species.\n\nBy monitoring diet composition and relative predation rates, we will be able to provide valuable insights for management decisions aimed at minimizing predation on salmonids above McNary Dam on the Columbia River. The main assumption underlying this methodology is that seasonal sampling represents the annual diet composition of these piscivores, providing a comprehensive understanding of their feeding habits throughout the year."

  "value": " Based on the provided text, the proposed study aims to quantify the consumption rates of northern pikeminnow, smallmouth bass, and walleye on juvenile salmonids above McNary Dam on the Columbia River. The data collected will be analyzed using the Fish Bioenergetics 4.0 mass balance bioenergetics model to provide insights for management decisions to reduce predation on salmonids.\n\nHere's why investing in this study is valuable:\n\n1. Understanding predator-prey dynamics: By quantifying the consumption rates of northern pikeminnow, smallmouth bass, and walleye on juvenile salmonids, we can gain a better understanding of the predator-prey dynamics in the Columbia River ecosystem. This information is crucial for effective management strategies to minimize predation and promote salmonid populations' health.\n\n2. Informed decision-making: The results of this study will help guide management decisions regarding predation control measures, such as implementing fisheries regulations or habitat restoration projects. By having accurate data on predator diet composition and relative predation rates, we can make more informed decisions to mitigate the impacts of predators on juvenile salmonids above McNary Dam.\n\n3. Sustainable fishery management: Ensuring sustainable fishery management is essential for maintaining a healthy ecosystem and preserving recreational and commercial fishing opportunities. By understanding the predator-prey dynamics, we can design more effective strategies to minimize predation impacts on juvenile salmonids while also considering the role of these species as a food source for humans and other higher trophic levels in the ecosystem.\n\n4. Long-term population monitoring: Continuous monitoring of predator diets and their impact on juvenile salmonids is essential to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of salmonid populations. This information can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of management strategies over time and adapt them as needed to address changing environmental conditions or predator populations.\n\nIn summary, investing in this study is valuable because it will provide crucial insights into predator-prey dynamics, inform decision-making for effective management strategies, contribute to sustainable fisheries management, and enable long-term population monitoring of juvenile salmonids above McNary Dam on the Columbia River."

  "problem_statement": " The problem the protocol is trying to solve is the high mortality of juvenile anadromous salmonids (chinook, sockeye, Coho, and steelhead) due to temporal and spatial predator-prey overlap with non-native predator fishes in sections of the Columbia River. The goal is to collect data on the diet composition of northern pikeminnow, smallmouth bass, and walleye during two sampling periods to quantify their consumption rates of juvenile salmonids above McNary Dam on the Columbia River. This information will be used to inform management decisions aimed at reducing predation on salmonids and protecting their populations."

  "description": " In this study, the focus is on examining predator-prey overlap and its consequences on juvenile anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River, specifically above McNary Dam. Three piscivore species, northern pikeminnow, smallmouth bass, and walleye, will be targeted to quantify their consumption rates of juvenile salmonids.\n\nTo collect these predator fish, boat electrofishing will be employed. This non-lethal method utilizes an electric current to stun fish, enabling researchers to easily capture them without harm. After collection, the piscivores' diets will undergo lavage and dissection to obtain accurate dietary information.\n\nTemporal stratification is a crucial aspect of this study as it ensures data representativeness of the period with the highest predator-prey overlap. Two sampling times will be carried out: the first during the initial half of May, targeting age-1 chinook, sockeye, Coho, and steelhead smolt; and the second in early to mid-June, focusing on age-0 Chinook smolt outmigration.\n\nTo analyze the dietary data, the Fish Bioenergetics 4.0 mass balance bioenergetics model will be employed (Deslauriers et al. 2017). Predator growth rate, diet composition, prey energy density (joules/g), and water temperature of the predators' environment are essential parameters for this model.\n\nBy monitoring the diet composition and relative predation rates of northern pikeminnow, smallmouth bass, and walleye, valuable insights will be gained to inform management decisions aimed at reducing predation on juvenile salmonids above McNary Dam on the Columbia River. The primary assumption underlying this study is that seasonal sampling accurately represents the annual diet composition of these piscivore species."
