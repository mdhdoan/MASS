  "abstract": " In this study, researchers aim to investigate the effectiveness of nutrient enrichment treatments in improving freshwater productivity in streams within the upper Salmon River subbasin in the Pacific Northwest of the US. The area has historically relied on large amounts of marine-derived carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus from anadromous salmonids. However, declining populations of these fish have led to a paucity of marine-derived nutrients, affecting freshwater productivity and the growth and survival of resident and anadromous fish species.\n\nTo address this issue, researchers plan to assess the impact of nutrient enrichment treatments on selected streams in the upper Salmon River subbasin by comparing the conditions in treatment streams (where nutrients are added) with control streams (without nutrient additions). The objectives of the study include:\n\n1. Identifying nutrient-limited streams within the upper Salmon River subbasin.\n2. Increasing freshwater productivity by adding supplemental nutrients (SCA) to selected streams in the upper Salmon River subbasin.\n3. Documenting chemical, physical, and biological conditions in study streams.\n4. Evaluating the stream food web response to additions of adult spring Chinook salmon, spring Chinook salmon carcasses, and/or salmon carcass analogs in select Salmon River Basin streams.\n5. Disseminating the results of the Salmon River subbasin nutrient enrichment study.\n\nThe researchers plan to employ a randomized-treatment experimental design, similar to previously completed work by Shoshone Bannock Tribes and other Columbia Basin cooperators, to assess the effectiveness of nutrient enrichment treatments. By comparing the conditions in treatment and control streams, they aim to determine if the addition of nutrients results in improved freshwater productivity, growth, and survival of fish populations.\n\nIn summary, this study is necessary as declining populations of anadromous salmonids have led to a paucity of marine-derived nutrients affecting freshwater productivity and the health of resident and anadromous fish species in the upper Salmon River subbasin. By experimentally enriching nutrient-limited streams with carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, researchers hope to improve freshwater productivity and understand the ecological consequences of adding adult spring Chinook salmon, spring Chinook salmon carcasses, and/or salmon carcass analogs in select Salmon River Basin streams. The results from this study will contribute valuable insights into the role of marine-derived nutrients in freshwater ecosystems and inform potential conservation strategies for maintaining fish populations and freshwater productivity."

  "description": " The text body discusses the impact of declining Pacific salmonid populations on freshwater productivity in the upper Salmon River subbasin located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States (California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho). The authors aim to evaluate the effectiveness of nutrient enrichment treatments by conducting experiments on nutrient-limited upper Salmon River subbasin streams.\n\nObjective 1: Identify nutrient-limited streams within the upper Salmon River subbasin (USR) is critical for understanding the extent of nutrient limitation in USR Basin streams. The authors propose to quantify and assess streamwater nutrient concentrations, nutrient limitation, course particulate organic matter retention, periphyton standing stock, macroinvertebrate density, biomass, and community composition, leaf litter decay rates, river metabolism measures, and aquatic food web connections in treatment streams and control streams that do not receive nutrient additions.\n\nObjective 2: Increase freshwater productivity by adding supplemental nutrients (SCA) to selected USR Basin streams is essential for improving the growth and survival of resident and anadromous fish species, including four species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. The authors will employ a randomized-treatment experimental design similar to previously completed work by the Shoshone Bannock Tribes and other Columbia Basin cooperators. Nutrient additions may include adult spring Chinook salmon, spring Chinook salmon carcasses, or salmon carcass analogs.\n\nObjective 3: Document chemical, physical, and biological conditions in study streams is crucial for understanding the baseline conditions of USR Basin streams before nutrient additions. The authors will assess changes in streamwater nutrient concentrations, nutrient limitation, course particulate organic matter retention, periphyton standing stock, macroinvertebrate density, biomass, and community composition, leaf litter decay rates, river metabolism measures, and aquatic food web connections.\n\nObjective 4: Evaluate the stream food web response to additions of adult spring Chinook salmon, spring Chinook salmon carcasses, and/or salmon carcass analogs in select Salmon River Basin streams is necessary for understanding the potential cascading effects of nutrient additions on the USR Basin food web. The authors will compare the bioenergetics, growth, and survival of resident and anadromous fish species between treatment and control streams.\n\nObjective 5: Disseminate Salmon River subbasin nutrient enrichment results is critical for sharing knowledge and insights with stakeholders, policymakers, and the scientific community. The authors will publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals, present their work at conferences, and engage with local communities to ensure that their research contributes to ongoing efforts to restore and protect the Salmon River subbasin ecosystems.\n\nThe proposed study aims to investigate the effectiveness of nutrient enrichment treatments on freshwater productivity in USR Basin streams and assess the food web response to nutrient additions using a randomized-treatment experimental design. The authors will quantify and assess various chemical, physical, and biological parameters before and after nutrient additions to identify any changes in stream conditions. The results of this study could inform future restoration efforts and contribute to ongoing conservation initiatives for Pacific salmonid populations in the Salmon River subbasin."
