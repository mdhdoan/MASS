  "abstractText": "Fork length is the length from the most anterior part of a fish to the tip of the median caudal fin rays. Fork length is commonly used in fish species that have forked caudal fins - where the dorsal and ventral rays are longer than median rays. Longer rays are often damaged or eroded by contact with rocks, debris, or hatchery walls.",
