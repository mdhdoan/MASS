2. Abstract: This document outlines the Department of Ecology's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for collecting representative grab samples from various types of stormwater conveyance systems. The SOP aims to ensure comparability between data collected by different organizations and groups using equipment from different manufacturers, while also providing a standardized method for collecting stormwater quality samples at a single point in a stormwater conveyance system that accurately represents the site's discharge.
3. Description: The SOP provides detailed guidance on equipment selection, sampling techniques, and site selection for manual sampling of stormwater from pipes, outfalls, and open ditch systems. The procedure covers the use of intermediate collection devices but does not describe the operation of unattended automated sampling devices. The SOP has two main objectives: to employ standard methods that ensure comparability between data collected by different organizations and groups using equipment from different manufacturers and to collect stormwater quality samples at a single point in a stormwater conveyance system that will be representative of a site's discharge.
4. Target: The primary focus of the SOP is to provide standardized methods for use by a variety of stormwater conveyance systems, ensuring accurate and comparable data collection.
5. Constraints: While the SOP provides standardized methods for manual sampling of stormwater, there may be some cases where sampling procedures vary based on the type of equipment used to collect samples. This could present a constraint in situations where specific equipment is required or recommended for certain types of conveyance systems.
