  "abstractText": "Noxious weeds are non-native, invasive species regulated by state and/or federal agencies with the potential to displace and compete with native species. In restoration projects, noxious weeds, if left unmanaged, have the potential to negatively impact the success of a restoration project. In addition, there are laws and rules regulating noxious weeds at the federal and state levels.Mapping of noxious weeds and documenting the percent cover of noxious weeds is done in restoration projects to evaluate project objectives toward establishing desired vegetation communities and to identify potential weed management needs within a restoration project.",
