2. Abstract: This method involves the capture and dissection of juvenile salmon during trawl surveys to gather basic data such as length and weight, and collect specific tissues for further lab analyses. The necessity of this method lies in its contribution to understanding salmon ecology by providing crucial information about the physical characteristics and tissue composition of juvenile salmon.
3. Description: In this process, juvenile salmon are caught using trawl surveys and then dissected to collect basic data such as length and weight. Specific tissues are also excised for further lab studies aimed at understanding salmon ecology. The dissection and collection of tissue samples provide valuable information about the physical characteristics and internal composition of juvenile salmon, which can be used to study various aspects of their biology and ecology.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to gather data on the physical characteristics and tissue composition of juvenile salmon, with the goal of contributing to the understanding of salmon ecology.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the availability and accessibility of juvenile salmon populations, the need for appropriate trawl survey equipment, and the requirement of laboratory facilities and expertise for further tissue analysis.
