 1. Keywords: Monumenting sites, GPS coordinates, site identification, reference information, top and bottom of a site.
2. Abstract: The method described aims to provide a permanent means of identifying historical or important sites through the use of monuments with GPS coordinates and relevant reference information. This enables accurate location and rediscovery of sites, including identification of the top and bottom if the site's length exceeds 10 meters.
3. Description: The method involves establishing a monumented site for future visits, where monuments serve as permanent identifiers equipped with GPS coordinates and necessary reference information for easy monument refinds. The GPS coordinates allow accurate pinpointing of the site location. For sites longer than 10 meters, additional details regarding the top and bottom of the site are captured to ensure complete identification.
4. Target: Accurate and permanent site identification through monumentation.
5. Constraints: The effectiveness of this method depends on the availability of accurate GPS coordinates and reference information during monument installation, as well as consistent preservation of the monuments over time. Additionally, for sites longer than 10 meters, clear demarcation of the top and bottom may require specific landmarks or additional guidance to ensure precise identification.
