 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the relevant keywords for the text body you provided:

1. Marker horizons
2. Sampling
3. Surface Elevation Table (SET)
4. Incision
5. Cut plugs

Now, let's fill out the rest of the sections based on the given information:

2. Abstract:
The method described in the text involves sampling marker horizons to quantify deposition on a wetland surface. This is typically done on the same day that a Surface Elevation Table (SET) is measured, and it's important to minimize disturbance to the sample plot. The sampling can be accomplished by making an incision or using cut plugs. This method allows researchers to study wetland deposition patterns and gain insights into environmental changes.

3. Description:
The text explains a method used to quantify deposition on a wetland surface through the sampling of marker horizons. The sampling is typically done on the same day that a Surface Elevation Table (SET) is measured, which provides important data about the wetland's elevation and other characteristics. To sample the marker horizons without disturbing a large area of the plot, researchers make an incision or use cut plugs. This method is useful for studying wetland deposition patterns and environmental changes over time.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to quantify deposition on a wetland surface through the sampling of marker horizons.

5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is the need to minimize disturbance to the sample plot while sampling. This means that the incision or cut plug methods must be carefully executed to avoid damaging the wetland environment. Additionally, the sampling must be done on the same day as the Surface Elevation Table measurement, which may require careful planning and coordination.
