  "background": "An overall goal of the Dworshak Reservoir nutrient restoration project is to improve the efficiency of the foodweb, thereby increasing the size and abundance ofkokaneein the reservoir to benefit the sport fishery and other resident fishes. In order to assess the effects of nutrient restoration on the abundance, size and fecundity of spawningkokanee, we examine a variety of metrics on an annual basis. Each fall, we conduct visual spawner counts for four index streams within three days of the historical peak of spawning activity. We also collect pre-spawn kokanee from these index streams to evaluate size and fecundity.",
