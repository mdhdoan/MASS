2. Abstract: This text discusses the reproductive strategy of white sturgeons, which are characterized as periodic reproductive strategists. These fish have a long lifespan and mature late in life, producing many offspring at infrequent intervals. The necessity for this reproductive strategy is explained by the highly variable environments these fish inhabit, where mortality of young may be unpredictable and successive reproduction depends on specific cues or conditions. To inform management inputs such as sex ratios, age at first maturity, and spawning periodicity, it is important to determine the maturational stage and reproductive structure of white sturgeons. However, this can only be done through histological examination of adult fish.
3. Description: White sturgeons are identified as periodic reproductive strategists, meaning they have a long lifespan and experience low mortality after the juvenile stages. They typically mature late in life and spawn multiple times over their lifetime, producing many offspring. This reproductive strategy is believed to have evolved in response to highly variable environments where mortality of young may be high. In these environments, successful reproduction depends on specific cues or conditions which may be rare events. Modeling white sturgeon population dynamics is complicated as it is highly sensitive to various inputs including sex ratios, age at first maturity, and spawning periodicity. These inputs are crucial for successful management, but it is currently not feasible to assign gender or maturational stage without a histological examination of adult white sturgeons. By examining the gonads from mature white sturgeons, the maturational stage and reproductive structure can be determined, providing valuable information for managing these fish populations.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to determine the maturational stage and reproductive structure of white sturgeons through histological examination of adult fish.
5. Constraints: The main constraint of this method is that it requires the examination of gonads from adult (i.e., sexually mature) white sturgeon, which may not always be available or easily obtainable. Additionally, the process of histological examination can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
