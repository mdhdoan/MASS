2. Abstract: This method details the process of collecting grab-water samples from wadeable streams for analysis of five key parameters: Total Phosphorus, Total Nitrogen, Chloride, Turbidity, and Total Suspended Solids. These tests are crucial in evaluating water quality and the ecological health of the stream. The method should be performed by trained staff at every data collection event, preferably during the start of the sampling event. It is important to note that sunscreen or insect repellent should not be used to avoid contamination of the samples.
3. Description: This method outlines the specific steps for collecting grab-water samples from wadeable streams to test for five parameters: Total Phosphorus (measured using colorimetric analysis), Total Nitrogen (measured using persulfate method), Chloride, Turbidity, and Total Suspended Solids. The procedure requires one or more trained staff members to carry out the task during each data collection event, typically at the start of the sampling event. It is essential that personnel avoid using sunscreen or insect repellent while performing this method to prevent contamination of the samples.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to provide a standardized procedure for collecting water samples from wadeable streams for analysis of key parameters indicative of water quality and ecological health.
5. Constraints: To ensure accurate results, it is crucial that staff performing this method have received appropriate training. Additionally, they must avoid using sunscreen or insect repellent during the sampling process to prevent contamination of the samples.
