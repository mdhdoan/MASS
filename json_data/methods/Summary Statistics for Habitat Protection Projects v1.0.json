  "abstractText": "After field data collection, the data are uploaded into an MS Access database which then computes summary statistics to reflect habitat conditions at the reach scale. These summary statistics were generally developed as part of the EPA EMAP and were selected for this program based on their high signal to noise ratios as compared to other potential summary variables. The following variables are reported for Habitat Protection Projects: GPS Coordinates, Sample Date, Reach Length, Reach Width, Log10 of Volume of LWD, Mean Residual Pool Vertical Profile Area, Mean Residual Pool Area, Percent Fines, Percent Embeddedness, Canopy Cover, Riparian Vegetation Structure, Bank Erosion, Non-native Shrub Cover, Coniferous Basal Area, Coniferous Density, Deciduous Basal Area, Deciduous Density, Fish Species Assemblage Index, and Macroinvertebrate Multimetric Index.",
