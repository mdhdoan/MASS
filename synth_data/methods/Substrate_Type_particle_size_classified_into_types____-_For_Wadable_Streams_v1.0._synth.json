  "abstract": " This method is used to identify and categorize substrate types at eleven equally spaced locations within a given site. It involves setting up transects using method ID 3828, which can only be applied after the Major Transects Method has been executed. The focus of this procedure is limited to measuring features in one primary channel. By implementing this method, researchers or investigators are able to obtain valuable data on substrate distribution and composition within a specific site, contributing to a better understanding of the site's ecological conditions.\n\nHere's a simplified version without code:\n\nThis text describes a procedure for determining substrate types at eleven equal distances in a particular location (site). First, you must implement method ID 3828 to set up transects. This method can only be performed after the Major Transects Method has been carried out. The analysis is restricted to assessing one main channel during this process. By carrying out this method, researchers will gain insights into substrate distribution and composition at the given site, enhancing our knowledge of the site's ecological characteristics."

  "description": " In this technical description, we delve deeper into the procedure outlined in the method text for identifying and classifying substrate types at specific locations, using a prescriptive approach that involves setting up 11 equidistant transects at each site. This process adheres to method ID 3828.\n\nTo begin with, this technique is centered around measuring and categorizing substrates within one primary channel at every location. It's important to note that this analysis can only be carried out following the application of the Major Transects Method.\n\nThe implementation of transect establishment starts by setting up 11 equally spaced transect lines, each line marking a distinct measurement location within the given site. This process ensures consistent and standardized data collection across all sites. The method text recommends utilizing method ID 3828 as a guideline for this step.\n\nLimiting measurements to one primary channel is crucial in maintaining focus on a specific area, making it easier to accurately collect and analyze substrate data. This restriction helps maintain the method's precision and consistency throughout the entire analysis process."

  "constraints": " The text describes a method for classifying substrate types at 11 equidistant transects at each site. Here are the constraints mentioned in the text and where they are stated:\n\n1. Measurements will be restricted to one main channel: This constraint is stated by \"Measurements in this procedure will be restricted to one main channel.\"\n2. Method must be preceded by Major Transects Method: This constraint is stated by \"This method must be preceded by the Major Transects Method.\"\n\nNo additional explanations are necessary as all mentioned constraints have clear statements within the text. Therefore, there's no need for generating any code here."
