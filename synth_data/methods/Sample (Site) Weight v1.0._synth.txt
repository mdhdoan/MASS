2. Abstract:
A GRTS (Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified)-based sampling design is used in fisheries management to estimate total spawner abundance accurately. A sample weight, or expansion factor, represents the number of km a particular site covers when expanded to the whole spawning distribution or strata. This method helps calculate total spawner abundance (method ID: 5409), providing a more accurate and unbiased estimation for fisheries management decisions.

3. Description:
The text introduces the Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) - based sampling design used in conjunction with sample weights, or expansion factors, to estimate Total Spawner Abundance. The sample weight represents the number of km that a particular site represents when expanded to the whole spawning distribution, estimation area, or strata (group). This method (method ID: 5409) is particularly useful for accounting for uneven spatial distribution and improving accuracy in fisheries management.

4. Target:
The primary goal of this method is to accurately calculate Total Spawner Abundance by using a GRTS-based sampling design, taking into account the sample weight as an expansion factor representing the number of km a specific site covers within the spawning distribution or strata.

5. Constraints:
There are no explicit constraints mentioned in the text; however, potential limitations could include ensuring accurate spatial representation and obtaining reliable data to derive the sample weights.
