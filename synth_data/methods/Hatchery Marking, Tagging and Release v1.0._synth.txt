2. Abstract: The Nez Perce Tribe's Department of Fisheries Resources Management collects hatchery evaluation data from fish at 18 different facilities. This data collection is critical for managing and conserving fish populations. The types of hatchery facilities include adult traps, picket weirs, holding ponds, spawning facilities, juvenile rearing locations, and acclimation release sites. Each site is managed in a way that is tailored to the individual hatchery, species, and run-timing of the fish being collected. This approach allows for more effective management of fish populations by taking into account their specific needs and characteristics.

3. Description: The Nez Perce Tribe's Department of Fisheries Resources Management (DFRM) is responsible for collecting hatchery evaluation data from fish at 18 different facilities. These facilities include adult traps, picket weirs, holding ponds, spawning facilities, juvenile rearing locations, and acclimation release sites. The management of each site is completed solely by the Nez Perce Tribe, collaboratively with co-managers or with the Tribe taking an assistance role. The DFRM uses species-specific and run-timing methods for collecting data at these facilities, ensuring that the data collected is relevant and useful for managing and conserving fish populations. This approach allows the DFRM to tailor its management strategies to the specific needs and characteristics of each fish population, resulting in more effective conservation efforts.

4. Target: The primary goal of the Nez Perce Tribe's hatchery evaluation data collection method is to effectively manage and conserve fish populations by taking into account their individual needs and characteristics.

5. Constraints: One constraint of this method is that it requires a significant amount of resources, including staff time and funding, to collect data at 18 different facilities. Additionally, the success of this method depends on the availability and accessibility of fish populations for data collection.
