  "abstract": " Longlines are a fishing method using baited hooks that can be employed in various marine and freshwater habitats for both commercial and research purposes (Everhart and Young, 1981; Hubert, 1996). This technique is particularly effective for capturing large sturgeon while minimizing the catch of other species due to its simple design and deployment (Elliot and Beamesderfer, 1990). Longlines are versatile and can be used in both still (lentic) and flowing (lotoc) water environments within freshwater habitats (Hubert, 1996).\n\nThe importance of longline fishing stems from its ability to efficiently target specific species like sturgeon while reducing bycatch. Traditional fishing methods often result in unintended catches of various species, which can lead to overexploitation and environmental imbalances. Longlines help mitigate this issue by focusing on the desired species, thus promoting sustainable fishing practices.\n\nAdditionally, longline fishing offers several advantages over other methods. Its minimal training and maintenance costs make it an attractive option for both small-scale fisheries and large commercial operations (Elliot and Beamesderfer, 1990). Furthermore, the standardization of longline efforts across multiple geographic areas and sampling platforms enables consistent data collection for research purposes.\n\nOverall, longlines are a valuable fishing method that addresses the need for efficient, targeted capture of desired species while minimizing bycatch and environmental impact. Its simple design, versatility, and cost-effectiveness make it an essential tool in various fishing applications."

  "description": " Passive sampling gear referred to as longlines is used extensively in both marine and freshwater environments for commercial and research fishing applications (Everhart and Young, 1981; Hubert, 1996). Longlines are characterized by the use of baited hooks that are attached to a main line, which can be set at varying depths depending on the target species (Hubert, 1996).\n\nWithin freshwater habitats, longlines are effective in both lentic and lotic environments. In lentic systems, such as lakes or ponds, the longline is anchored in place and allowed to soak, while in lotic systems, such as rivers or streams, the longline can be moved upstream or downstream with the current flow (Hubert, 1996).\n\nDepending on the size of the hooks used, a wide range of sturgeon species can be captured using longlines (Elliot and Beamesderfer, 1990). The use of anchored longlines in freshwater systems has been shown to be highly effective at capturing large numbers of sturgeons while minimizing bycatch of other unwanted species (Elliot and Beamesderfer, 1990).\n\nLonglines are known for their simple design and deployment, which results in low training and maintenance costs. Furthermore, efforts can be standardized across multiple geographic strata and sampling platforms due to the consistent methodology employed (Elliot and Beamesderfer, 1990).\n\nIn summary, longlines are a type of passive sampling gear used extensively in aquatic environments for capturing sturgeon species. They consist of baited hooks attached to a main line that can be deployed in both lentic and lotic habitats in freshwater and marine systems. The use of anchored longlines has been shown to be effective at capturing large numbers of sturgeons while minimizing bycatch of other species, and their simple design results in low training and maintenance costs, making them a valuable tool for both commercial and research applications.\n\nNo code is generated as the question did not request it."
