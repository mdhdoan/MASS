  "abstract": " This text describes a study focusing on measuring the percentage of substrate sizes at the tails of pools and non-turbulent channel units. The method involves quantifying the percentage of substrate that is smaller than 2 mm (<2 mm) and between 2-6 mm separately.\n\nIn previous studies, size categories were not mutually exclusive, meaning that <2 mm was also included in the <6 mm category. To address this issue and obtain more accurate results, the method now distinguishes between these two categories. This change allows for a clearer understanding of the distribution of substrate sizes within each category.\n\nThis separation of size categories is essential to gain precise insights into the composition of different substrate sizes and their distributions in various environments (pools and non-turbulent channel units). By quantifying these percentages, researchers can better understand how substrate size influences ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling and biogeochemical transformations.\n\nThere is no code provided with this text description. However, if needed, the data collected from this study could be analyzed using statistical software or programming languages like R or Python to generate visualizations (graphs, histograms) or perform further analyses on the data."

  "description": " This text describes a study focusing on quantifying the percentage distribution of surface substrate sizes at pool tails and non-turbulent channel units. The two distinct size categories are less than 2 millimeters (mm) and between 2-6 mm. Previously, these categories were not mutually exclusive, with the smaller category being included in the larger one.\n\nIn 2012, changes were made to this methodology, ensuring that the size categories were now mutually exclusive. Therefore, less than 2mm is no longer counted as part of the less than 6mm category. This modification provides a clearer understanding of substrate distribution across various size ranges within these environments."

  "target": " Analyze substrate sizes at pool tails: <2mm, 2-6mm. Mutually exclusive categories since 2012."
}{
  "constraints": " Based on the given text, the following constraints can be identified:\n\n1. The percentage of surface substrate less than 2 mm and between 2-6 mm needs to be quantified for pools and non-turbulent channel units.\n2. The size categories are now mutually exclusive, meaning that <2 mm is no longer counted in the <6 category.\n\nThe method or location of these constraints in the text can be seen in the following sentences:\n- \"Quantify the percentage of surface substrate <2 mm and between 2-6 mm at the tails of pools and non-turbulent channel units.\"\n- \"Changed size categories to be mutually exclusive. <2 is no longer counted in the <6 category.\""
