2. Abstract: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recommends documenting various biological parameters to demonstrate Evolutionarily Significant Unit/Distinct Population Segment (ESU/DPS) viability for listed species. This is crucial for effective conservation and management efforts. Fin tissue samples from juvenile steelhead and Chinook salmon are collected for Genetic Stock Identification, which allows for a more accurate understanding of population structure and connectivity, thereby enhancing management strategies.
3. Description: NOAA recommends annual documentation of biological parameters to determine ESU/DPS viability for listed species. Crawford and Rumsey (2011) outline the importance of monitoring juvenile abundance, age distribution, sex ratio, length, and run timing at population, major population grouping, and ESU/DPS levels. Fin tissue samples are collected from juvenile steelhead and Chinook salmon to facilitate Genetic Stock Identification (GSI), a method that can reveal the genetic makeup of individual fish and identify their stocks of origin. Detailed instructions for GSI include information on sample collection, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and data analysis.
4. Target: The primary focus is to ensure ESU/DPS viability by documenting biological parameters and employing Genetic Stock Identification to enhance conservation and management efforts for listed species.
5. Constraints: The method requires technical expertise in genetic analyses, specialized laboratory equipment, and funding for sample collection and analysis. There may be legal restrictions on tissue sampling, particularly for endangered or threatened species, which need to be considered and adhered to.
