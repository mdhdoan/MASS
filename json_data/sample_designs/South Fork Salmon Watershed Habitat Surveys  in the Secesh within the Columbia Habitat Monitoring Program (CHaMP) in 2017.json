  "description": "<p>CHaMP&nbsp;is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010).&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;salmonids&nbsp;and/or their habitat. The implementation of&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;56.3,&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;57, and&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;3.&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel (see section 1.6), at least 9 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The South Fork Salmon domain was divided into two major strata (Secesh&nbsp;and Greater South Fork Salmon) for which separate stratification and designs were developed. The standard&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;panel structure of an annual and three, three year rotating panels was utilized.&nbsp; The targeted&nbsp;TRT&nbsp;populations were the Steelhead (Snake River Basin&nbsp;DPS) -&nbsp;Secesh&nbsp;River, Steelhead (Snake River Basin&nbsp;DPS) - South Fork Salmon River, Chinook Salmon (Snake River Spring/Summer-run&nbsp;ESU) - East Fork South Fork Salmon River, Chinook Salmon (Snake River Spring/Summer-run&nbsp;ESU) -&nbsp;Secesh&nbsp;River, and Chinook Salmon (Snake River Spring/Summer-run&nbsp;ESU) - South Fork Salmon River&nbsp;Mainstem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2017 Design updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, All 12&nbsp;annual sites were assigned to rotating panels due to the programmatic decision to remove annual sites from the designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annual reassignments included:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-0428434&nbsp; to RP1, use order 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-235154 to RP1, use order 2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-345375&nbsp;to RP1, use order 3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-241618 to RP1, use order 4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-382610&nbsp;to RP2, use order 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-045010 to RP2, use order 2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-374418 to RP2, use order 3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-339922 to RP2, use order 4</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-086815 to RP3, use order 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-404767 to RP3, use order 2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-0258887 to RP3, use order 3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-488223&nbsp;to RP3, use order 4</p>\r\n\r\n<p>block counts were changed to 15 for each RP. &nbsp;Rejected sites and oversample sites remained in the annual panel but block counts were changed to 0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2016 Design updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were no changes to the design in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2015 Design updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All core&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;designs were updated to accommodate effort that will go towards the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://isemp.egnyte.com/dl/EcV8YyGyV5\" style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 16.7999992370605px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">10% repeat design for&nbsp;CHaMP</a>. &nbsp; The design update will result in 3 annual sites from the active design (e.g. 2014) and move one to each rotating panel. &nbsp;This will result in a net freeing of 2 visits each year that can be used to revisit 2 sites. &nbsp;This change preserves the annual sites within the design and adjusts the frequency of sampling. &nbsp;2 sites slated for sampling in the current year (e.g. 2015) will be randomly selected for repeat sampling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Secesh,&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-231826, Secesh, moved to RP2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200bCBW05583-317074, Secesh, moved to RP1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-087698, Secesh, moved to RP3</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2014 Design update notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were no updates to the study objectives, target frame, or site selection in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2013 Design update notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were no changes to the South Fork Salmon design in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2012 Design update notes:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, there were no changes to the&nbsp;GRTS&nbsp;draw, however the sampling priority shifted to the&nbsp;Secesh&nbsp;and no sites were sampled in the Greater South Fork Salmon strata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\u200b2011 Original Design Notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Secesh&nbsp;site selection design notes:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the&nbsp;Secesh, there were 5 legacy sites drawn from the&nbsp;CBW&nbsp;master sample that were previously sampled in 2009-2010 during fish surveys for the Integrated Status and Effectiveness Monitoring Program (ISEMP).&nbsp; These sites were included as &#39;legacy&#39; sites included in the pool of sites for the&nbsp;GRTS&nbsp;draw, but were not selectively chosen to be at the top of the Use Order for the draw.&nbsp; No stratification was imposed for the design, i.e., no allocation of sites by valley class, nor by ownership.&nbsp; Site allocation to panels followed the standard&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;allocation of 15 annual and 10 sites to each rotating panel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Site allocation:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>R code for Salmon Design:</strong>&nbsp;Secesh.SFSal.6.13.r</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strat.panel function version:</strong>&nbsp;Stevens.strat.panel.4.r</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Secesh GRTS input file</strong>: Secesh_MS_20110530.txt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Secesh Final Design File:</strong>&nbsp;Secesh.6.1.2011.csv</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>South Fork Salmon Design Files:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://isemp.egnyte.com/h-s/20140123/57704d0e7e1449a8\">SFS_DesignFiles.zip</a>&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
