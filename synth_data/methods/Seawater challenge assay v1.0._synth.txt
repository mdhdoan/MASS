2. Abstract:
During the smoltification process, juvenile salmonids prepare for migration to the ocean and osmoregulation in seawater. A simple and effective method to assess smoltification is to subject the fish to a seawater challenge during the time of year they are undergoing this transformation (e.g., April to May for steelhead). Fish that survive in seawater are classified as smolts, while those that do not are classified as non-smolts. This method helps researchers and fishery managers understand the progression of smoltification and the physiological readiness of juvenile salmonids for ocean migration.

3. Description:
The process of smoltification involves physical and physiological changes that enable juvenile salmonids to migrate to the ocean and thrive in seawater. A seawater challenge is a practical and straightforward method to evaluate the success of smoltification. During this challenge, juvenile salmonids are exposed to seawater, and their ability to survive and maintain osmotic balance is assessed. Smolts, or those that successfully adapt to seawater, demonstrate a higher likelihood of surviving and thriving in the ocean environment. In contrast, non-smolts struggle to regulate their osmotic balance and may not be prepared for migration. This method provides valuable insights into the progression of smoltification, allowing researchers and fishery managers to make informed decisions regarding the timing and success of ocean migrations.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to assess the success of smoltification in juvenile salmonids by subjecting them to a seawater challenge.

5. Constraints:
This method requires access to seawater and appropriate facilities for safely containing and observing the juvenile salmonids during the challenge. Additionally, the timing of the challenge is critical, as it must occur during the natural smoltification period of the specific salmonid species.
