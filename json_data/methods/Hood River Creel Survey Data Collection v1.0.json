  "abstractText": "Creel surveys are conducted annually on the Hood River to estimate the non-tribal harvest of summer and winter steelhead, spring and fall Chinook salmon, and coho salmon. Harvest estimates are reported according to run year, and in the case of steelhead that period spans two calendar years. Prior to the removal of Powerdale Dam in 2010, angling was restricted to the lower 4.5 river miles (river mouth to dam). Additional sections of the Hood River were made available to anglers with the removal of the dam including the area from the dam upstream to the confluence with the West Fork Hood River (approximately 8 additional river miles) and in the West Fork Hood River from the mouth to Punchbowl Falls (approximately 0.5 additional river miles). Angler creel surveys were consequently redesigned from years prior to dam removal to reflect the change in available angling areas. The survey area is divided into geographic sections including sections 3 and 4 which were added after angler area was expanded (see attached figure).",
