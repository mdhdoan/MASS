  "abstractText": "We conduct snorkeling surveys each summer through the months of July and August. The months ofJuly and August are the most advantageousdue to minimized flow and temperature conditions. We snorkel and document observed abundance of rearing subyearling Chinook by habitat classification. Reach habitat sites are broken down prior to snorkel sampling. This is all done in one day before the snorkel surveys begin. A crew will float the section or sections to besurveyed, marking thetop and bottom via GPSof each habitat type (Riffle, Deep Riffle, Rapid, Pool, Glide and Run). Each habitat type is then numbered and classified to habitat type in descending order. Site selection for snorkel surveys are random and based on previously classified habitat types. The protocol for this method is 100 meters of snorkeling from the bottom of the surveysite. Many sites will not measure 100 meters in length due to the length of the habitat type.",
