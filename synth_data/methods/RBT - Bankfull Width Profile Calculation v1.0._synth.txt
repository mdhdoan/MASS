 Sure, I'd be happy to help label the topics and provide an analysis of the text you provided. Here are five keywords that I believe are highly relevant to the method described:

1. GIS tools
2. River channel measurement
3. Digital elevation models (DEMs)
4. Profile metrics
5. Data filtering

Now, let's move on to the analysis of the text:

2. Abstract:
The text describes a method for measuring river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and GIS tools. This method, called RBT, is part of the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software suite. The RBT allows users to calculate various profile metrics at repeated intervals along the length of a river site. These metrics include mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, filtered mean, and filtered standard deviation. The method can use DEMs derived from airborne remote sensing or ground-based topographic surveys. The RBT is particularly useful for identifying and excluding outliers in the data, which can improve the accuracy of the metrics reported.
3. Description:
The RBT is a set of GIS tools that work within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software. It allows users to describe and measure river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground-based topographic surveys. Profile metrics are calculated at repeated intervals down the length of the site, with a customizable interval distance. Each profile metric comprises several output values, including mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, filtered mean, and filtered standard deviation. The filtered metrics report the same statistics but for a subset of the profile intervals. Filtering removes any values from the population that are more than a set number of standard deviations from the population mean, which can help to exclude outliers from the metrics reported.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide a reliable and accurate way to measure river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and GIS tools. The method aims to improve the accuracy of the metrics reported by identifying and excluding outliers in the data.
5. Constraints:
The main constraint of this method is the need for high-quality digital elevation models (DEMs) that accurately represent the river channel being measured. Additionally, the method requires a customizable interval distance for calculating profile metrics, which may not be available or feasible in all cases. Finally, the filtering threshold used to exclude outliers from the data may impact the accuracy of the metrics reported, and should be set carefully based on the specific needs of the project.
