2. Abstract:
This method, version 2.0 by Carol Volk, focuses on estimating the percentage of riparian understory covered with vegetation using the CHaMP-Riparian Structure Method based on Peck et al. (2001). The estimation is carried out at 5 transects along both banks within a 10mx10m plot, averaging the areal coverage of the understory (0.5-5m) visually. This information can help monitor and assess riparian health and vegetation growth in various ecosystems.

3. Description:
The method involves estimating the percentage of riparian understory covered with vegetation based on version 2.0 by Carol Volk, last revised on 12-19-2018 for CTUIR. The process follows the CHaMP-Riparian Structure Method derived from Peck et al. (2001) methods used in EMAP. Five transects are established along both banks within a 10mx10m plot, measured from bankfull. At each transect, the percentage of understory coverage is visually estimated and averaged to provide an overall average percentage cover for the entire plot.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to estimate the riparian understory's vegetation cover percentage using a systematic approach of transects and plots.

5. Constraints:
There are no explicit constraints mentioned in the provided text body, but some potential challenges may include subjectivity in visual estimation, ensuring consistent measurement techniques across different users, and environmental factors affecting visibility or accessibility to the transects and plots.
