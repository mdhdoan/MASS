2. Abstract:
The use of mainstem habitats by juvenile salmonids is crucial for their survival, especially under warmer water conditions. This method focuses on characterizing sites where field crews collect physical habitat data to determine their suitability as fish habitat. The information gained will help Action Agencies and the Services make adaptive management decisions and inform long-term management planning. Furthermore, it will aid in evaluating the effectiveness of temperature and habitat restoration mitigation measures.

3. Description:
This method concentrates on the use of mainstem habitats by juvenile salmonids to better understand their behavior and requirements in various water conditions. The data collected from these sites will allow for adaptive management decisions on a year-to-year basis, ensuring that appropriate actions are taken to maintain and improve the fish habitat. Additionally, the method provides valuable occupancy and habitat use information during warmer water conditions, which can be used to inform long-term management planning. By documenting water clarity at field sites, this method helps in evaluating temperature and habitat restoration mitigation measures' effectiveness. Overall, this approach aims to ensure the preservation and enhancement of juvenile salmonids' habitats by providing essential information for decision-makers.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to characterize fish habitats and assess their suitability for juvenile salmonids, while also evaluating temperature and habitat restoration mitigation measures.

5. Constraints:
Possible constraints for this method include limited access to some field sites, resource availability for data collection, and potential limitations in the accuracy of water clarity measurements. Additionally, the success of the method heavily relies on the ability to make adaptive management decisions based on the collected data.
