2. Abstract: The Washington State Department of Ecology's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) presents a comprehensive method for calculating pollutant loads from stormwater discharges. This SOP focuses on determining seasonal and annual pollutant loads, expressed as pounds per year and pounds per acre per year, by utilizing continuous flow recordings, rainfall records, water quality data, and automated flow-weighted composite samplers. The method emphasizes the use of contaminant concentrations in time trend analysis, rather than estimated event-based or annual loads, due to random variability in stormwater quality.
3. Description: This SOP, developed by the Washington State Department of Ecology, offers a detailed procedure for calculating pollutant loads from stormwater discharges. The SOP starts by defining the necessary data inputs, which include continuous flow recordings, rainfall records, water quality and base flow quality data, and sampling results collected using automated flow-weighted composite samplers. The method then explains how to calculate event mean concentrations (EMCs) using reported laboratory concentrations from these composite samples.

The SOP further details the steps for calculating average annual and seasonal mass loads using flow-weighted averages, without assuming any underlying correlation between flow and concentration. This decision is based on the lack of observed correlations in urban stormwater data, as opposed to rivers and streams where such methods might be applicable.

Furthermore, the SOP highlights the importance of focusing on contaminant concentrations in time trend analysis due to the large component of random variability in contaminant loads that can confound long-term changes in stormwater quality interpretation. The SOP concludes by specifying its applicability to calculating pollutant loads from outfall discharge pipes, and acknowledging other available loading methods while providing a rationale for the chosen method based on work accomplished by City of Tacoma and Anchor Environmental.
4. Target: Primary focus is to establish a reliable and accurate SOP for calculating pollutant loads in stormwater discharges, emphasizing time trend analysis using contaminant concentrations.
5. Constraints: The primary constraint for this method is the reliance on continuous data collection for flow rate, rainfall, and water quality, which might not always be available or feasible due to resource limitations or logistical challenges. Another constraint is the assumption that no correlation exists between flow and concentration, which may not hold true in all cases, potentially limiting the applicability of this method under certain conditions.
