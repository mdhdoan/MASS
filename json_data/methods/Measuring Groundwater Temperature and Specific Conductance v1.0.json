  "abstractText": "Groundwater temperature and conductivity can be important parameters to collect when developing an groundwater network.  Tracking temperature and conductivity levels can help determine areas of groundwater-surface water interaction.  Conductivity can also give some indication as to the age and origin of groundwater.  This method specifically describes taking temperature and conductivity measurements of groundwater from wells.",
