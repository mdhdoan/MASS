2. Abstract:
Since 1991, researchers have identified and described a total of 227 spawning sites for fall Chinook salmon in Hells Canyon on the Snake River. To monitor the success of the salmon population, it is necessary to count the number of redds (nests) constructed by the salmon each year. However, manually counting redds is time-consuming and can be disruptive to the salmon. Therefore, a subset of spawning sites is selected each year to be surveyed using unmanned aerial systems (UAS), which provide an efficient and non-invasive way to count redds. These counts are then used to determine the total number of redds constructed in the canyon in a given year, providing important data for managing the salmon population.
3. Description:
The text describes a method for counting redds (nests) constructed by fall Chinook salmon in Hells Canyon on the Snake River. Since 1991, a total of 227 spawning sites have been identified and described. Each year, a subset of these sites is selected to be surveyed using unmanned aerial systems (UAS), which provide high-resolution imagery that can be used to count redds. These counts are then used to estimate the total number of redds constructed in the canyon during a given year. The use of UAS technology allows for efficient and accurate counting while minimizing disruption to the salmon.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to accurately count the number of redds constructed by fall Chinook salmon in Hells Canyon on the Snake River, with the aim of managing the salmon population and protecting their habitat.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is that it relies on selecting a subset of spawning sites to survey each year, rather than surveying all 227 identified sites. This means that the total number of redds constructed in the canyon may be underestimated if the selected sites are not representative of the overall population. Additionally, weather conditions and other environmental factors may limit the use of UAS technology for counting redds. Finally, the accuracy of redd counts may be affected by the skill and expertise of the personnel interpreting the UAS imagery.
