  "abstractText": "Floodplain woody vegetation species composition and percent cover is collected in established plot locations within the floodplain and used to evaluate the progression of restoration cover types toward the desired condition. This information is used to inform potential maintenance needs such as weed management.Timing and Schedule: This metric is intended to document woody vegetation cover as riparian vegetation communities establish in restoration project areas. Woody vegetation establishment is expected to occur through both active revegetation by planting containerized trees and shrubs as well as natural recruitment of native woody species. Measureable canopy cover from establishing young woody species is expected to develop within approximately 5 years after implementation. These data may be collected in coordination with cover type mapping (refer to method #1182).",
