  "abstractText": "Reacting nitrogen under basic conditions with potassium persulfate causes digestion of organic N in compounds such as proteins into inorganic nitrogen in the form of Nitrate. Reacting phosphorus under acidic conditions with potassium persulfate causes digestion of organic P in compounds such as ATP into inorganic phosphorus in the form of phosphates.The following procedure (based on the experiments of Valderama, 1981) explains the process of accomplishing successful completion of both of these reactions at the same time in the same sample vial using a boric acid  sodium hydroxide system (with digestion efficiencies above 80%). To be run on the Astoria autoanalyser.",
