Because the Kootenai River burbot stock is so limited (Paragamian and Laude 2008), the introduction of a genetically similar donor stock was found to be a useful approach to enhance the population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past few years, intensive culture techniques developed by the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, BC Ministry of Environment, the UIARI, and Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) have become an important restoration measure for burbot on the Kootenai River. The management goal of this study is to restore the burbot population in the Idaho reach of the Kootenai River in order to provide an annual sustainable harvest of burbot.</p>\r\n",

  "objectives": [
    "Determine condition suitable for stocking burbot in tributaries of the Kootenai River.",
    "Determine if burbot stocked into specific tributaries will return to their stocking location to spawn.",
    "Determine differences in growth and survival between ponds.",
    "Determine if pond raised burbot grow and survive better than those reared in a hatchery and stocked into the main Kootenai River.",
    "Describe fish assemblage and population-level relationships with habitat.",
    "Evaluate efficacy of sampling techniques for fish assemblages and the influence of habitat characteristics on detectability."
