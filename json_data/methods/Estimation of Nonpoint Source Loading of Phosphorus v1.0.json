  "abstractText": "Phosphorus is often a limiting nutrient in freshwater systems. Diffuse sources such as agricultural and residential fertilizer, sewage, dish soap, and livestock combined with soil erosion contributephosphorus in runoff. Cultural eutrophication, caused by these anthropogenic nutrient contributionsin the watershed, can lead to harmful algal blooms, hypoxia and changes in the ecology of receiving waters. The general methods for estimating nonpoint source loading of phosphorus were first developed by Vollenweider(1968), but the derived formula listed below appeared in Gilliom(1983).",
