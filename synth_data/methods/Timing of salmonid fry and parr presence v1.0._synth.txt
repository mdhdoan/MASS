2. Abstract: This text presents the importance of monitoring the timing of fry and parr presence in native salmonid populations, particularly focusing on Snake River fall Chinook salmon. Changes in population size over time and density-dependent competition for food and space can significantly affect these phenotypic traits. A decision on whether to remove this species from the federal list of threatened species requires understanding the status of the population, which includes considering the timing of fry and parr presence. The text also outlines methods used to calculate these timings, offering valuable insights for researchers and decision-makers.
3. Description: The methodology discussed here emphasizes the significance of tracking the timing of fry and parr presence in native salmonid populations across watersheds in northern latitudes. A key factor influencing these traits is the steady increase in population size over time, which can lead to long-term changes. Construction of redds (nests) by later spawners on top of earlier-built redds may cause loss of earlier fertilized eggs and alter the timing of fry presence. Additionally, increased competition for food and space due to growing rearing populations can result in earlier emergence of parr. Connor et al. (2002) established size-related criteria for distinguishing between natural Snake River fall Chinook salmon and parr, while Connor et al. (2013) provided evidence for density-dependent changes in the timing of parr presence. These findings are crucial when assessing the status of Snake River basin fall Chinook salmon populations for potential delisting from the federal list of threatened species.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to accurately determine and analyze the timing of fry and parr presence in native salmonid populations, specifically Snake River fall Chinook salmon.
5. Constraints: A major constraint for this method is the availability of accurate data on population size, spawning times, and environmental factors such as food supply and water conditions. The accuracy and reliability of these data directly impact the effectiveness of the method in predicting changes in fry and parr presence timings.
