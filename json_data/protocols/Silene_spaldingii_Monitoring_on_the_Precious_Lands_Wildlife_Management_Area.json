  "background": "Spaldings catchfly (Silene spaldingii) is a rare plant endemic to the bunchgrass, sagebrush-steppe, and open pine communities of the inland Pacific Northwest. Large portions of these habitats have been eliminated by cultivation or degraded by livestock grazing. Spaldings catchfly was listed as Threatened by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2001.During a noxious weed survey conducted in 2003, a Wallowa Resources employee located what he thought was a small population of Silene spaldingii above Joseph Creek on the Precious Lands Wildlife Area in Northeast Oregon. Tribal botanistsreturned to the site on July 14, 2004 and confirmed thathe had indeed located the first population of Spauldings catchfly on the Tribal lands in Oregon.",
