  "background": "High summer water temperature limits steelhead production in many reaches of the Columbia River tributaries. We monitor water temperature using dataloggers to identify the lower bounds of steelhead rearing habitat. Stream flow is also a primary limiting factor for steelhead production.  Stream discharge measurements are collected for managing instream flows, stream gaging, and planning and implementing restoration projects. Temperature information is often requested by restoration contractors for design of stream restoration projects, for drafting reach assessments, and it is requested by other agencies and programs.",
