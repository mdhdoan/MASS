  "abstractText": "PIT detection systems are widely used through the Columbia River basin for stock assessment purposes of all life histories of fish. Many of these systems are either fixed in place in streams, or dam fishways as permanent structures, or are temporary installations in tributary streams or other. Advances in PIT technologies along with a need for deployment of PIT systems in areas not previously covered, have both lead to the creation of floating barges outfitted with autonomous PITdetection capabilities. In collaboration with Biomark - a floating PIT barge outfitted with four (4) IS1001 powered PIT antennas for deployment in large deep rivers and lakes.",
