  "abstract": " The ISEMP monitoring protocol focuses on estimating juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead abundance and survival in the South Fork Salmon and Lemhi rivers using rotary screw traps. Standardizing trapping and fish handling methods among these traps is crucial to ensure accurate and reliable data collection. This method is essential as it provides valuable information for status, trend, and effectiveness monitoring programs.\n\nDownstream migrant trapping of juvenile salmonids using rotary screw traps can estimate total freshwater production, survival between life stages, and migration behavior. Simple mark-recapture methods are employed to achieve these objectives.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of efficiency estimates, several assumptions must be met: traps function properly on intended days, marked and unmarked individuals have equal mortality rates, marked tags remain undamaged upon recapture, marked individuals are captured at the same rate as unmarked ones, and marked individuals mix randomly with unmarked individuals. Moreover, it is assumed that trap efficiency estimates reflect the true proportion of the captured emigrating population.\n\nBy following this standardized protocol, ISEMP aims to estimate juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead survival (egg-to-smolt), estimate their emigration abundance at ISEMP rotary screw traps, and determine trap efficiency for these species at ISEMP rotary screw traps. This information is crucial in understanding the population dynamics of anadromous salmonids and their habitat within the Interior Columbia River Basin."

  "value": " Investing in the monitoring protocol described in the text body can bring several valuable benefits related to the management of anadromous salmonids (Chinook salmon and steelhead) and their habitat in the South Fork Salmon and Lemhi rivers of the Interior Columbia River Basin:\n\n1. Standardization of trapping and fish handling protocols: By implementing a standardized protocol for operating rotary screw traps, we ensure consistent methods among different ISEMP teams. This standardization is essential for accurate data collection and comparison across sub-basins.\n\n2. Indirect estimation of juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead survival (egg-to-smolt): Downstream migrant trapping can be used to estimate total freshwater production, enabling the calculation of survival rates between life stages.

Estimation of juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead emigration abundance: Rotary screw traps provide an effective tool for estimating emigration abundance within a target sub-basin. Accurate emigration estimates are essential for assessing population status and trend, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of management actions.\n\n4. Estimation of trap efficiency for juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead at ISEMP rotary screw traps: Efficiency estimates are necessary to assess the performance of the rotary screw traps and ensure they accurately reflect the true proportion of the captured emigrating population. By regularly evaluating trap efficiency, we can make informed decisions on equipment maintenance or improvements to enhance data collection.\n\nBy investing in this monitoring protocol, we will obtain reliable and accurate data on juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead populations, their survival rates, and emigration abundance within the target sub-basins of the South Fork Salmon and Lemhi rivers.

  "description": " The Interior Columbia River Basin's ISEMP (Interagency Salmonid Monitoring Program) aims to design, test, implement, and evaluate Status and Trends Monitoring for Chinook salmon and steelhead populations and their habitat, as well as conduct Effectiveness Monitoring for management actions impacting these species (1). ISEMP employs a pilot-project approach in several major subbasins of the Interior Columbia River Basin, specifically the South Fork Salmon and Lemhi rivers (1).\n\nTo accomplish these goals, population-specific and aggregate estimates of juvenile abundance and survival are required. These metrics will be derived from recapture data obtained using Instream PIT Tag Detection Systems (IPTDS) or rotary screw traps (1). ISEMP has deployed rotary screw traps in the South Fork Salmon and Lemhi rivers to estimate juvenile abundance and survival within these sub-basins.\n\nStandardization of protocols and sampling designs is crucial for achieving statistically valid and powerful results (2). The following trapping and fish handling protocol standards are implemented among ISEMP's rotary screw traps:\n\n1. Proper function: Rotary screw traps must effectively capture targeted juveniles on intended trapping days when unattended (3, 4).\n2. Equal mortality: Mortality rates for marked and unmarked individuals should be equivalent (5).\n3. Retention of marks: Marked individuals must retain their PIT tags throughout the entire monitoring period and all tags are detected upon recapture (6, 7).\n4. Equal capture rates: Marked and unmarked juveniles should have equal capture rates in rotary screw traps to prevent trap avoidance or happiness effects (8).\n5. Random mixing: Marked individuals must mix randomly with unmarked individuals within the target population for accurate abundance and survival estimates (9, 10).\n6. Representativeness: Marked individuals should be representative of the entire target Chinook salmon and steelhead population for which abundance and survival will be estimated (11).\n\nUnder the assumption that trap efficiency estimates accurately reflect the true proportion of captured emigrating populations (3), the following objectives can be met using ISEMP's rotary screw traps:\n\n1. Indirectly estimate Chinook salmon and steelhead survival (egg-to-smolt): Downstream migrant trapping data from IPTDS and rotary screw traps can be used with simple mark-recapture methods to estimate total freshwater production and enable the estimation of survival (and mortality) between life stages.\n2. Estimate juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead emigration abundance: Rotary screw trap data can provide estimates of Chinook salmon and steelhead juvenile abundance within the target sub-basins.\n3. Estimate trap efficiency for juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead: Trap efficiency estimates help evaluate the overall performance and success of ISEMP's rotary screw traps in capturing Chinook salmon and steelhead juveniles, ensuring accurate abundance and survival estimates."

  "constraints": " The text provides several constraints related to estimating juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead abundance and survival using rotary screw traps in the South Fork Salmon and Lemhi rivers within the ISEMP project:\n\n1. Standardization of trapping and fish handling protocols among rotary screw traps operated by ISEMP: This constraint is essential to ensure consistent data collection methods across different trap locations, which improves the accuracy and comparability of the results. It's stated in the text as follows: \"This protocol aims to provide standardization of trapping and fish handling methods among rotary screw traps operated by ISEMP.\"\n\n2. Estimating juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead survival (egg-to-smolt): The text mentions that downstream migrant trapping can be used to estimate survival between life stages, but it doesn't provide explicit constraints for this particular estimation. However, the assumptions listed under \"efficiency estimates\" imply that accurate survival estimation requires equal mortality rates for marked and unmarked individuals, no trap avoidance or happiness, and representative samples of the target population.\n\n3. Estimating juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead emigration abundance at ISEMP rotary screw traps: The text mentions that simple mark-recapture methods can be used to estimate total freshwater production and enable the estimation of survival, implying that abundance estimation can be derived from these data.
