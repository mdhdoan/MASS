2. Abstract: This protocol details the process of detecting the presence of Renibacterium salmoninarum DNA in anterior kidney tissue through Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The use of a nested PCR approach, where the PCR product of the first reaction is used as template for the second reaction, increases specificity and sensitivity. This method is crucial for early detection and control of bacterial kidney disease (BKD) in salmonids, caused by Renibacterium salmoninarum, thereby improving overall fish health and preventing economic losses in aquaculture.

3. Description: The given text describes a protocol for detecting Renibacterium salmoninarum DNA in anterior kidney tissue using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This method consists of two steps: the initial PCR reaction, followed by a nested or secondary PCR reaction that uses the product from the first reaction as its template. The primers used for this protocol are specified in Pascho et al. (1998). To prevent contamination, all steps must be performed wearing gloves. Sample preparation and DNA extraction procedures are explained separately. This nested PCR method enhances sensitivity and specificity compared to standard PCR methods, making it suitable for detecting Renibacterium salmoninarum infections at an early stage and facilitating appropriate measures to mitigate the spread of bacterial kidney disease (BKD).

4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is the specific detection of Renibacterium salmoninarum DNA in anterior kidney tissue, which contributes to controlling BKD outbreaks and improving fish health in aquaculture.

5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method include potential issues with DNA extraction from samples, maintaining sterile conditions throughout the PCR process, availability of appropriate reagents, and ensuring compatibility with laboratory equipment.
