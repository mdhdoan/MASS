2. Abstract: The method described aims to provide accurate analysis of water streams for total nitrogen and total phosphorous, which are critical parameters in assessing water quality. By collecting a single grab sample and adding concentrated sulfuric acid as a preservative, the sample's composition remains stable during transportation to the lab. Additionally, duplicate and blank samples are collected to ensure data accuracy and reliability, with freezing of all samples upon return to the office further enhancing sample integrity.

3. Description: This method focuses on the collection and handling of water samples from streams for total nitrogen and phosphorous analysis. A grab sample is taken directly from the stream, ensuring a representative snapshot of the water's composition. Concentrated sulfuric acid serves as a preservative to maintain sample integrity during transportation to the lab by preventing changes in nutrient concentrations. For 10% of reaches where samples are collected, duplicate and blank samples are gathered to ensure data accuracy and reliability. Duplicate samples verify that analytical procedures produce consistent results, while blank samples account for potential contamination or background noise within the analysis process. Upon return to the office, all samples are frozen to preserve their composition and prevent degradation.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to ensure accurate and reliable water quality assessment through proper sample collection, preservation, and handling techniques for total nitrogen and phosphorous analysis.

5. Constraints: This method has constraints related to logistics and resources, including ensuring adequate sampling equipment, timely transportation of samples to the lab, and appropriate storage facilities at the office. Additionally, compliance with safety regulations when handling concentrated sulfuric acid is essential, requiring proper protective gear and training for personnel involved in the process.
