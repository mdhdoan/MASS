  "description": "<p>The purpose of this study plan is to provide a framework for consistent repeated sampling to determine examine trends in the abundance&nbsp;and survival of juvenile summer steelhead out-migrating from Birch Creek.&nbsp; Out-migrating juvenile steelhead are captured using a rotary screw trap or inclined plan screen trap.&nbsp; Birch Creek is a major steelhead producing tributary in the Umatilla River and managed as a wild fish sanctuary.&nbsp; Juvenile steelhead typically exit Birch Creek between December and June, with the majority leaving in early May.&nbsp; The small stream size and large population size result in ample capture of juveniles resulting in abundance estimates that typically meet recommend data precision standards.</p>\r\n",
