  "abstractText": "A Distell Fish Fatmeter (model 692) is used to estimate the energetic potential of fish. This device was developed as a non-invasive alternative to fish quality grading in the commercial sector. The fatmeter passes low energy microwaves through fish tissues to determine the percentage of water in fish tissues, which provides a measure of tissue lipid content due to the inverse relationship between water content and lipid content in fish tissues.",
