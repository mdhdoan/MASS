Now, let's fill out the rest of the sections based on the given text body:

2. Abstract: This method, referred to as Method 7026, provides a way to calculate bank stability as a percentage based on field measurements. The necessity for this method arises from the importance of assessing and ensuring the stability of banks in various contexts. By using a standardized data collection method, Method 7026 helps users accurately measure bank stability and make informed decisions.
3. Description: The objective of Method 7026 is to calculate bank stability as a percentage based on field measurements. To do this, the recommended data collection method is Method 7026 itself. This method involves gathering relevant data through field measurements, and then using a specific calculation to determine the bank stability as a percentage. By following this method, users can ensure that they are collecting data in a consistent and standardized way, which can help improve the accuracy and reliability of their bank stability calculations.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of Method 7026 is to provide a standardized method for calculating bank stability as a percentage based on field measurements.
5. Constraints: One constraint of Method 7026 is that it requires access to the appropriate field measurement equipment and techniques in order to gather accurate data. Additionally, users must be familiar with the specific calculation used in Method 7026 in order to properly determine bank stability as a percentage.
