 1. Keywords: Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags, avian predation, juvenile salmonids, Columbia River estuary, nesting colonies, hydroelectric dams.
2. Abstract: This method involves the use of PIT tags to document mortality of juvenile salmonids caused by birds nesting in the Columbia River estuary. The tags allow for the calculation of avian predation rates and testing of hypotheses on the effects of smolt morphology, condition, abundance, and origin on smolt vulnerability. This method provides a valuable tool for understanding and mitigating the impact of avian predation on juvenile salmonid populations.
3. Description: The method described in the text involves the use of PIT tags to track juvenile salmonids and determine their mortality caused by avian predation in the Columbia River estuary. The tags, which are deposited on bird colonies after consumption, allow for the calculation of avian predation rates based on the percentage of released or detected fish at hydroelectric dams. This method also enables the testing of hypotheses on the effects of smolt morphology, condition, abundance, and origin on smolt vulnerability to avian predation. The use of PIT tags provides a detailed and accurate way to monitor and understand the impact of avian predation on juvenile salmonid populations.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to document mortality and test hypotheses related to avian predation on juvenile salmonids in the Columbia River estuary.
5. Constraints: The success of this method relies on the availability and proper functioning of PIT tags, as well as the presence of bird colonies in the area. Additionally, the calculation of avian predation rates may be affected by factors such as tag loss or damage, and variations in smolt migration patterns.
