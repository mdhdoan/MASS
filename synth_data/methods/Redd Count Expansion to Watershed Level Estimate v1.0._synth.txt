2. Abstract: The GRTS (Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified) design is used to estimate the total number of redds (spawning nests) constructed in a watershed during a spawning season. To do this, survey counts collected using Method ID:131 are first expanded within each stratum and then to the entire basin. This method ensures a more accurate estimation compared to traditional methods by accounting for the uneven distribution of redds in different areas of the watershed.
3. Description: The text describes a method for estimating the total number of redds constructed in a watershed during a spawning season using the GRTS design. This design involves stratifying the watershed into different sampling units and then allocating survey efforts proportionally across these strata based on their expected productivity. The survey counts collected using Method ID:131 are expanded first within each stratum and then to the entire basin, providing a more accurate estimation of the total number of redds constructed in the watershed. This method is useful for fisheries management and conservation efforts as it allows for a better understanding of spawning activities in different areas of the watershed.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to estimate the total number of redds constructed in a watershed during a spawning season using the GRTS design.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need for accurate survey counts collected using Method ID:131, as well as a thorough understanding of the GRTS design and its application to the specific context of redd surveys in watersheds. Additionally, the method requires access to detailed information about the watershed's stratification and productivity, which may not always be available or accurate.
