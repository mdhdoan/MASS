2. Abstract:
The gamete preservation project described in this text aims to use cryogenic technology to preserve male germplasm from low-abundance and high-risk spring and summer Chinook salmon and summer steelhead conservation units. This method seeks to maintain genetic diversity for artificial propagation programs and preserve genetic diversity from selected wild populations as an insurance policy against population collapse and extirpation. The project plans to sample spring and summer Chinook salmon from July 1st through October 15th, summer steelhead from February 15th through June 30th, and potentially add fall Chinook salmon collections in the future.

3. Description:
The text outlines a method for preserving male germplasm from spring and summer Chinook salmon and summer steelhead conservation units using cryogenic technology. The project targets conservation units that are at low levels of abundance and high risk of extirpation, with the goal of maintaining and preserving genetic diversity for ongoing artificial propagation programs. The project plans to sample spring and summer Chinook salmon from July 1st through October 15th and summer steelhead from February 15th through June 30th. Additionally, the text mentions that fall Chinook salmon collections may be added in the future, which would occur from October 1st through December 15th. The method aims to serve as an insurance policy against population collapse and extirpation by preserving genetic diversity from selected wild populations.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to preserve and maintain genetic diversity for artificial propagation programs, both conventional and captive broodstock, and to preserve genetic diversity from selected wild populations as an insurance policy against population collapse and extirpation.

5. Constraints:
There are no explicit constraints mentioned in the text body; however, the success of this method may depend on various factors such as the availability of funding, the ability to collect high-quality germplasm samples, and the effectiveness of cryogenic technology in preserving genetic diversity over time.
