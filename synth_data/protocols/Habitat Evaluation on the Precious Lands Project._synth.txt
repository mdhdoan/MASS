2. Abstract: The text outlines a protocol for evaluating and monitoring the impact of the Bonneville Power Administration's activities on wildlife habitats under the Northwest Power Planning Act. A Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP) is used to measure the amount and quality of habitat lost and gained, providing a quantitative evaluation in terms of Habitat Units (HUs). Long-term monitoring will focus on plant community health, weed encroachment, limiting factors for wildlife, and areas of habitat degradation.
3. Values, Statements and Outcomes: The values underpinning this protocol include compliance with the Northwest Power Planning Act, responsible environmental stewardship, and effective habitat conservation. The problem being addressed is the need to mitigate for wildlife habitat losses due to BPA activities. The desired outcomes are to develop trend data on plant community health and weed encroachment, determine limiting factors for wildlife, and identify and monitor areas of habitat degradation.
4. Description: The HEP modeling strategy is a technical approach that uses models based on key habitat parameters to measure the quality of a specific habitat for target wildlife species. The HU accounting system provides a standardized metric for evaluating the habitat quality, with one acre of optimum habitat equating to one HU. Long-term monitoring will be conducted based on HEP data collection procedures, focusing on specific variables such as percent microbiotic crust cover in grasslands and number of woody debris >4 diameter in riparian and conifer cover types.
5. Objectives: The main objective is to develop trend data for plant community health and weed encroachment from long-term monitoring of HEP transects, determine limiting factors for wildlife, and identify and monitor areas of habitat degradation. This objective covers the entire problem statement outlined in the text. Keywords related to this objective include: long-term monitoring, plant community health, weed encroachment, limiting factors for wildlife, and habitat degradation.
6. Target: The primary focus of this protocol is to establish a comprehensive approach for evaluating and monitoring the impact of BPA activities on wildlife habitats under the Northwest Power Planning Act.
7. Constraints: The main constraints for this protocol include the need for proper personnel training in HEP monitoring and local flora identification, as well as ensuring that transects are revisited at the same time of year and phenological stage of indicator plants as the baseline transects.
