 I understand that you would like me to create a list of five highly relevant keywords, provide an abstract, description, target, and constraints based on the text body "No valid data." However, there is no further information provided in the text body. Therefore, I will provide default values for each category based on the given text body:

1. Keywords: 
   - Data validation
   - Data integrity
   - Error handling
   - Input verification
   - Quality control

2. Abstract:
No valid data indicates an issue with input or processing methods, leading to a lack of usable information. Proper data validation and error handling are essential to ensure data integrity and provide meaningful results. These measures help prevent further complications in downstream processes and maintain the quality of information utilized in various applications.

3. Description:
The text body "No valid data" suggests that there is no usable data due to possible input errors or issues during processing. To avoid such situations, implementing data validation methods and error handling procedures are crucial. Data validation ensures that incoming data meets specific criteria before being processed further, while error handling identifies and manages exceptions during processing. By combining these techniques, the risk of encountering "No valid data" scenarios is significantly reduced, improving overall system reliability and data quality.

4. Target:
The primary goal is to maintain data integrity by preventing the propagation of invalid or erroneous data throughout a system.

5. Constraints:
Potential constraints include limited resources for data validation, complex data formats that are difficult to validate, and the need to balance performance with thoroughness in error detection.
