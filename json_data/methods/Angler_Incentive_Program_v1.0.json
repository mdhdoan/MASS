  "abstractText": "During the mid-2000s, increased predation created by a rapid expansion of the lake trout population became a limiting factor for kokanee. In response to predation concerns, actions were taken to evaluate predator reduction strategies and eventually an aggressive predator removal program was implemented in 2006 aimed at collapsing the lake trout population and temporarily reducing the rainbow trout population. A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used.Netting cannot be used to effectively capture rainbow trout, so the AIP is essentially the sole method to reduce rainbow trout predation on kokanee. Additionally, population modeling suggested angling was a critical component needed to effectively collapse the lake trout population (Hansen et al. 2010).",
