  "abstractText": "Scale samples are collected from a sample of natural origin adult salmon and steelhead trout to estimate age composition. NOAA recommends that to demonstrate ESU/DPS viability, annual documentation of a variety of biological parameters (including adult abundance, age distribution, sex ratio, length, and run timing) is needed at the population, major population grouping, and ESU/DPS level for each listed species (Crawford and Rumsey 2011). Detailed instructions for this method are provided below.",
