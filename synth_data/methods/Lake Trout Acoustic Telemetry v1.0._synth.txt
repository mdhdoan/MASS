2. Abstract: To address the issue of increased predation on kokanee by a rapidly expanding lake trout population, an aggressive predator removal program was implemented in 2006. This program utilizes both an angler incentive program and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) to reduce the lake trout population and temporarily decrease the rainbow trout population. Mobile and stationary telemetry is used to monitor lake trout movements and distribution patterns, particularly during the spawning period.
3. Description: During the mid-2000s, there was a significant increase in predation on kokanee due to a rapid expansion of the lake trout population. To address this concern, an aggressive predator removal program was implemented in 2006 with the aim of collapsing the lake trout population and temporarily reducing the rainbow trout population. This two-pronged approach involves the use of both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting. The AIP encourages anglers to catch and remove lake trout, while contract netting utilizes gill nets and trap nets to target mature lake trout during the spawning period. Additionally, mobile and stationary telemetry is used to document lake trout movements and distribution patterns, particularly during the spawning period. This information can be used to inform and improve predator reduction strategies.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to reduce the lake trout population and temporarily decrease the rainbow trout population in order to address increased predation on kokanee.
5. Constraints: The success of this method depends on angler participation in the AIP, the availability of resources for contract netting (gill nets and trap nets), and the accuracy and reliability of telemetry data. Additionally, there may be regulatory constraints related to the use of gill nets and trap nets.
