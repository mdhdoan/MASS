  "abstractText": "Collection estimates are the total number of juvenile salmonids calculated to have entered the juvenile bypass system at a particular dam. The collection estimate is derived from timed sub-samples taken at intervals throughout a daily twenty-four hour period. The timed sub-sample is determined by the sample rate(s) that are used at each site, on a daily basis. Therefore, the collection estimate is calculated by dividing the daily catch by the sample rate that was used that day",
