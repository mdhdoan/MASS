 1. Keyword list: Surface gradient, bed load movement, stream reach processes, rise over run, transects.
2. Abstract: The surface gradient method is used to model physical processes in a stream or river reach, such as bed load movement. By determining the elevation change between two transects and dividing it by the distance between them (rise over run), this method provides valuable insights into the stream's geomorphic characteristics and behaviors.
3. Description: The surface gradient method is employed to understand and analyze physical processes in a stream or river reach, specifically focusing on bed load movement. To apply the method, first, the rise in elevation between two transects is determined by subtracting their respective elevations. Then, this difference (rise) is divided by the specified length between the two transects, resulting in a value known as "rise over run." This value represents the change in elevation per unit of distance and is used to model stream reach processes, providing crucial information for understanding the geomorphic characteristics and behaviors of the waterway.
4. Target: The primary focus of the surface gradient method is modeling physical processes and bed load movement within a stream or river reach, offering insights into the waterway's geomorphic properties and behaviors.
5. Constraints: Applying the surface gradient method requires accurate elevation data for each transect, as well as a precisely defined distance between them. The accuracy of the resulting "rise over run" value depends on these inputs, making it essential to ensure proper measurement techniques are used when gathering the necessary information.
