  "background": "This document was developed to provide consistency with how habitat variable data is collected throughout the Columbia Basin Region in support of the Columbia River Wildlife Mitigation Program funded by Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). This publication is a stand alone reference for Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) and Combined Habitat Assessment Protocols (CHAP) transect techniques used by the Regional HEP Team (RHT).  This document is intended to be a user friendly habitat variable measurement technique manual for both novice and experienced field technicians alike. As a result, theory and mathematical/statistical discussions are held to a minimum. It is assumed that field technicians will possess the specific measuring devices discussed in this manual. Thus, device descriptions are limited in most cases.  English measurements e. g., inches, feet, etc., are used to accommodate measurements found in many HEP models and because English measurements are better understood by the general public. English measurements can easily be converted to metric equivalents if needed.",
