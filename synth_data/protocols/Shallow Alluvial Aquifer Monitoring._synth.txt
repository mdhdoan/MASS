 1. Abstract:
Groundwater monitoring is crucial to understanding and managing alluvial aquifer systems, which often interact with surface water. By correlating groundwater levels with high seepage loss areas in rivers, we can identify potential restoration projects that will help restore historic groundwater levels and increase stream flows. This protocol outlines the importance of collecting and analyzing groundwater data for various studies and decision-making processes.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes:
	* Values: Protecting and managing water resources effectively.
	* Problem Statement: Understanding and addressing the challenges in alluvial aquifer systems, such as declining groundwater levels and reduced stream flows.
	* Desired Outcomes: Improved decision-making for water resource management through better understanding of groundwater dynamics and interactions with surface water.
3. Description:
This protocol focuses on collecting and analyzing groundwater data in alluvial aquifer systems that interact with surface water. It emphasizes the importance of continuous data loggers and quarterly manual water level measurements at wells. The collected data will support model development, watershed planning, and studies on groundwater/surface water interactions.
4. Objectives:
	* Objective: Prepare and analyze comprehensive groundwater data for various applications in water resource management.
	* Summary of Solution Coverage: This objective covers the entire problem statement by providing accurate and up-to-date groundwater data, which can help address challenges in alluvial aquifer systems.
	* Keywords: Groundwater data, alluvial aquifer systems, water resource management, model development, watershed planning.
5. Target: Comprehensive groundwater data collection and analysis for effective water resource management.
6. Constraints:
	* Availability of resources (financial, human, and technological) to implement monitoring programs.
	* Ensuring access to well-placed wells for continuous data logging and manual measurements.
	* Maintaining the quality and consistency of collected data over time.
