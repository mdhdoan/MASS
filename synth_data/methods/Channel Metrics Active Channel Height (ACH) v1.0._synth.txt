2. Abstract: The Active Channel Height (ACH) is a vital concept in geomorphology, representing the vertical distance from the average level of the streambed to the top of the active channel. This measurement provides crucial information on the topography and morphology of a water body, helping to understand its behavior and evolution over time. ACH determination is essential for flood risk assessment, river management, and environmental studies.
3. Description: Active Channel Height (ACH) is defined as the vertical distance from the average level of the streambed to the top of the active channel. This measurement is crucial in understanding a water body's morphology and behavior, particularly in terms of flood risk assessment and river management. ACH can be affected by various factors such as sediment deposition, erosion, and human activities, making it essential to monitor changes over time. In this context, the ACH serves as an indicator for assessing the dynamic nature of a channel and its impact on surrounding areas.
4. Target: The primary focus of Active Channel Height is to provide a quantitative measure for understanding water body topography and morphology in the context of flood risk assessment, river management, and environmental studies.
5. Constraints: There are several constraints associated with ACH determination, such as data availability and accuracy, difficulties in identifying the average streambed level, and challenges in monitoring changes over time due to resource limitations or accessibility issues. Additionally, human activities like construction or dredging can also impact the ACH and introduce further complications for accurate measurement.
