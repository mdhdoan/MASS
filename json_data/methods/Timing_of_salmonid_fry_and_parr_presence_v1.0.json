  "abstractText": "Timing of fry and parr presence are important phenotypic traits that vary widely among native salmonids across watersheds of northern latitudes. A steady increase in population size over time is one factor that can affect long-term changes in those two traits. Construction of redds by later spawners on top of redds constructed by earlier spawners could change the timing of fry presence by loss of the earlier fertilized eggs that may have become earlier emerging fry. Similarly, timing of parr presence could become earlier as the rearing population increases in size due to density dependent competition for food and space (e.g., Figure 4; inset). Connor et al. (2002) developed size-related criteria for distinguishing between natural Snake River fall Chinook salmonOncorhynchus tshawytschafry and parr, and Connor et al. (2013) provided evidence for density-dependent changes in the timing of parr presence. That information will be important to consider when considering the status of the population at the time a decision is made about removing Snake River basin fall Chinook salmon from the federal list of threatened species. Methods for calculating the timing of fry and parr presence are described here.",
