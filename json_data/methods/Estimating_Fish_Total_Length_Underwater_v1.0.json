  "abstractText": "In order to determine fish lengths (for adults and juveniles)during underwater activities when it is not feasible to use a measuring board, such as snorkeling,researchers will need to accurately estimate total length. In addition, because objectsviewed underwater are magnified about 1.3 times, accurately estimatingthe size of fish underwater requires practice.Snorkelers can practice estimating fish sizes byviewing objects and fish of known sizes underwater.Calibrated wooden dowels or floating cutouts of fishof various sizes can be attached to weights and distributedthroughout a stream channel. Snorkelers approach each object andestimate its size. Live fishof known size can also be used. One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size. Another method is to capture fish of severalsize classes and place them in temporary live cages(Rich 1993). Snorkelers independently view each fishand report their results to an instructor.",
