2. Abstract: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) provides a comprehensive collection of daily climate data through the Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily (GHCN-Daily) dataset. This dataset integrates daily observations from approximately 30 different data sources, resulting in station-based measurements from over 90,000 land-based stations worldwide. The method describes the process of downloading this valuable data resource from the NOAA NCEI website, which is essential for many ecological studies and can be done at no cost.
3. Description: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) collects and archives both U.S. national and global climate data from various sources such as automated sensing systems, surface stations, cooperative observer networks, and the World Meteorological Organization. The GHCN-Daily dataset contains daily climate observations from approximately 30 different data sources, including over 90,000 land-based stations worldwide. Observations from over 25,000 stations are updated on a monthly basis. This dataset includes various climatic variables such as temperature, dew point, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and atmospheric pressure. The method focuses on downloading the GHCN-Daily dataset from the NOAA NCEI website for further analysis in ecological studies. Users can access this data at no cost, providing a valuable resource for researchers and organizations interested in climate data.
4. Target: The primary focus of the method is to provide guidance on downloading the GHCN-Daily dataset from the NOAA NCEI website for further analysis in ecological studies.
5. Constraints: There are no significant constraints mentioned in the provided text body. However, users should be aware that climate data can be large and complex, requiring sufficient storage capacity and processing power to handle it effectively. Additionally, users may need specialized knowledge or skills to analyze and interpret the data correctly.
