2. Abstract: Length measurements of specific parts of a fish are crucial when intact fish are unavailable. This method is essential in removing bias caused by eroded tails in female spawners or damaged jaws in spawning or dead salmon. By using the orbit and hypural plate as reference points, researchers can accurately compare lengths between male and female spawners, hatchery-spawned females, and carcasses.
3. Description: The necessity of length measurement in fish stems from situations where intact fish are not obtainable. Female spawners often have eroded tails due to redd excavation or enlarged or damaged jaws, which can introduce bias when comparing lengths between male and female spawners or hatchery-spawned females and carcasses. By focusing on specific parts of the fish that remain intact, researchers can ensure accurate comparisons. The hypural plate, a structure composed of modified vertebrae supporting the caudal fin rays, originates from the posterior end of the vertebral column. This region serves as an alternative reference point for length measurements, offering a more precise method than traditional techniques prone to bias from eroded tails or damaged jaws.
4. Target: Accurate and unbiased length measurement in fish when intact specimens are unavailable
5. Constraints: The success of this method depends on the preservation of specific body parts, such as the orbit and hypural plate. If these regions are also eroded or damaged, alternative reference points may need to be identified.
