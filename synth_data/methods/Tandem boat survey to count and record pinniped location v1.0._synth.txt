2. Abstract: Tandem boat surveys are used to collect data on sea lions for the purpose of generating mark/recapture sea lion abundance estimates. This method is necessary to monitor and assess the population size and distribution of sea lions in a given area. The use of tandem boats allows for efficient data collection while minimizing disturbance to the sea lions.
3. Description: Tandem boat surveys involve the use of two boats, where one boat is used to spot sea lions and the other boat is used to approach and mark or recapture the sea lions for data collection. The data collected from these surveys will be analyzed using method ID: 1256 to estimate sea lion abundance. This method allows for accurate and reliable population estimates, which can inform conservation and management efforts.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to generate mark/recapture sea lion abundance estimates through the use of tandem boat surveys.
5. Constraints: The success of this method relies on proper implementation, including adequate training for survey teams, appropriate handling and care for marked or recaptured sea lions, and accurate data collection and recording. Additionally, weather and sea conditions can impact the ability to conduct surveys and may limit the number of surveys that can be performed in a given time period.
