 1. Keywords: Average percentage, fine sediment, substrate composition, visual estimation, habitat unit.

2. Abstract: This method focuses on measuring the average percentage of pool tail substrates made up of fine sediment with particle sizes less than 2mm and 6mm. The data is collected through visual estimation of fines (<6mm) and sand (<2mm) as a percentage of the total substrate for each habitat unit within the site. This information is crucial in understanding the composition of pool tail substrates, which can aid in evaluating water quality and aquatic ecosystem health. The method description at [monitoringmethods.org/Method/Details/5329](https://monitoringmethods.org/Method/Details/5329) provides more details on the data collection process.

3. Description: The method involves determining the average percentage of pool tail substrates that consist of fine sediment, specifically particles sized less than 2mm and 6mm. To collect this data, researchers visually estimate the proportion of fines (<6mm) and sand (<2mm) as a percentage of the total substrate for each habitat unit within the site. The procedure is carried out systematically, following the guidelines provided in the reference method description at [monitoringmethods.org/Method/Details/5329](https://monitoringmethods.org/Method/Details/5329). This method provides valuable insights into the composition of pool tail substrates and can be used to assess water quality and aquatic ecosystem health, making it essential for environmental monitoring and management purposes.

4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to determine the average percentage of fine sediment in pool tail substrates.

5. Constraints: Possible constraints for this method include the subjectivity involved in visual estimation, variations in substrate composition due to factors such as weather conditions, water flow rates, and human activities, as well as the need for trained personnel to accurately perform the measurements.
