  "abstract": " This method involves using radio telemetry tags and receivers to track animals, particularly salmon, over large geographic areas without requiring permanent infrastructure. The equipment is installed and removed seasonally, making it a flexible solution for biologists. The detection range of the tag codes extends several hundred yards from the shoreline of rivers or bodies of water. Receivers can be set up at multiple fixed locations, such as near spawning reaches, or used on vehicles, boats, or planes to cover larger areas in less time.\n\nThe necessity of this method lies in its ability to provide valuable data for tracking animals over vast territories, which is crucial for monitoring population sizes and migration patterns. Compared to other methods requiring permanent infrastructure, radio telemetry offers a more cost-effective, portable, and adaptable solution. The use of Lotek tags and receivers, produced by a Canadian company specializing in this technology, has been extensively used and trusted throughout the Snake River basin by several agencies for tracking salmon populations."

  "description": " This text describes the use of radio telemetry tags and receivers for tracking animals over vast geographic areas. The equipment used in this method is manufactured by Lotek, a Canadian company specialized in radio telemetry products.\n\nThe radio telemetry system consists of two main components: tags attached to animals and receivers used to detect tag signals. Installation of the equipment doesn't necessitate permanent infrastructure and can be carried out seasonally. The detection range for individual tag codes extends over several hundred yards from the shoreline of large rivers, making it suitable for tracking animals near bodies of water.\n\nWhen employing radio telemetry for returning adult salmon, receivers can be set up at predefined locations with multiple antennas. These antennas are placed in various directions such as upstream, downstream, and towards tributaries that define the spawning reaches within a basin, like the Snake River Fall Chinook salmon (as depicted on the attached map). Receivers can also be utilized from vehicles, boats, or planes to cover larger areas more efficiently in a shorter time frame.\n\nThe radio telemetry tags transmit signals via radio waves, enabling biologists to remotely monitor and track tagged animals' movements and locations. The receivers, in turn, detect these transmitted signals and process the data, providing essential information for ongoing research and conservation efforts. In the context of the Snake River basin, Lotek's equipment has been extensively used by various agencies, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability within this ecosystem."
