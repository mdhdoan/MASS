Percent of the areal coverage ofthe understory (0.5-5m) is visually estimated for each plot.Average Percent Understory Cover is an average of the estimates from each of these 10 plots.The CHaMP - Riparian Structure Method provides background on the measurements that are analyzed for this calculation.
