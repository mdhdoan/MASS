2. Abstract:
Benthic macroinvertebrate sampling method (ID 244) and analysis method (ID 164) aim to assess biological integrity and stream health by characterizing the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage. This information can be used with multi-metric or predictive models for data comparison among users. The document does not cover other environmental data collection methods but encourages their use for a comprehensive analysis.

3. Description:
The text describes a method (ID 244) for sampling benthic macroinvertebrates, organisms living at the bottom of streams and rivers. This method generates data to characterize the macroinvertebrate assemblage, evaluating human-caused disturbances' impacts on stream health. The analysis method (ID 164) uses these procedures for biotic data analysis with multi-metric or predictive models. Site selection and design are not part of this protocol; instead, it focuses on actual sampling/collecting methods once the site has been chosen. These protocols can be applied to both targeted and probabilistic sampling designs. Stream reaches or sites should be sampled at a minimum of once during the index period (July 1st - October 15th) with an annual variation correction through resampling 10% of the sites or reaches. The number and location of sampling reaches or sites depend on monitoring objectives and sampling design.

4. Target:
The primary focus is to characterize benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in wadeable streams as an indicator of biological integrity and stream health.

5. Constraints:
These protocols are limited to actual sampling/collecting methods once the site has been selected, not covering physical habitat data or water quality data collection methods. They apply to most types of sampling designs that incorporate benthic macroinvertebrate sampling for wadeable streams but depend on objectives and sampling design choice (targeted or probabilistic).
