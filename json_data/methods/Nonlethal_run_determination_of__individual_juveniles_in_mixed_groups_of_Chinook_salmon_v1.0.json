  "abstractText": "Studying a specific run of Chinook salmonOncorhynchus tshawytschais complicated by the fact that fall, spring, and summer run juveniles coexist within river systems. Thus, the development of a nonlethal diagnostic method that discriminates the run of individual juveniles was needed in field studies. In the early 2000s, DNA markers began to complement allozymes especialy since the DNA markers had less stringent storage requirements and potentially higher resolution. The goal of Rasmussen et al. (2003) was to develop DNA markers that could be used nonlethaly to discriminate run of individual Chinook salmon juveniles. Rasmussen et al. (2003) described the use of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) products to identify a genetic marker (OT-38) that discriminates between the major Chinook salmon runs in the Columbia and Snake River basins. Use of that marker is described here.",
