2. Abstract: This method focuses on determining the impact of predation on the kokanee population in Lake Pend Oreille by calculating biomass, production, and mortality rates. By using population estimates, age-specific survival rates, and weight data from other methods, this approach provides a comprehensive understanding of how predation affects the kokanee population dynamics. This information is crucial for managing and preserving the kokanee population in the lake.

3. Description: The text details a method used to assess the effects of predation on the kokanee population in Lake Pend Oreille. By calculating annual biomass, production, and mortality rates based on population estimates and age-specific survival data, researchers can evaluate the health and sustainability of the kokanee population. This methodology offers a scientific framework for understanding the impact of predation and informing conservation efforts to protect this valuable species in their natural habitat.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to determine the effects of predation on the kokanee population within Lake Pend Oreille by calculating essential metrics like biomass, production, and mortality rates.

5. Constraints: The main constraint for this method is the availability and accuracy of data sources, such as population estimates, age-specific survival rates, and weight data from other methods. Additionally, environmental factors affecting kokanee populations (such as water temperature, oxygen levels, and food supply) should be considered when interpreting results to ensure that conclusions accurately represent predation's impact on the kokanee population.
