 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the five highly relevant keywords that I've identified from the text body:

1. RBT (River Bathymetry Toolkit)
2. GIS tools
3. High resolution DEMs (Digital Elevation Models)
4. Channel geometry metrics
5. CHaMP surveys

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract:
The River Bathymetry Toolkit (RBT) is a suite of GIS tools designed to work within ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software. The RBT allows users to analyze river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs), which can be obtained from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or ground-based topographic surveys. This method provides a comprehensive approach to describing and measuring river channels, computing stream gradient, sinuosity, and identifying fish habitats. It also helps in investigating the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. The RBT is an essential tool for CHaMP surveys as it provides a systematic approach to collecting and analyzing river channel data.
3. Description:
The RBT is a suite of GIS tools that work within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software, allowing users to describe and measure river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground-based topographic surveys. With the RBT, users can detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope, cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM, define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, compute stream gradient and sinuosity, and cut long profiles down the length of a channel, mapping longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. Additionally, users can vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension, which means that users must have ArcGIS installed before using any of the tools in the toolkit.
The CHaMP - Topographic Point Collection Methods provide background on collecting the measurement data analyzed for this calculation. For CHaMP surveys, the wetted centerline in 2011-2013 was a single line representing the mainstem. However, for sites processed with the 2014 topo toolbar, it is the total length of features flagged as the mainstem, excluding any features with the attribute side channel.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the RBT method is to provide a systematic approach to describing and measuring river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) within ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software.
5. Constraints:
The constraints for the RBT method include the requirement of having ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software installed as it is an ArcGIS extension. Additionally, the quality and accuracy of the DEMs used may impact the results obtained from this method.
