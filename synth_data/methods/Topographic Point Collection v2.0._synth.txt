2. Abstract: This method outlines the process of conducting a topographic survey to create a high-quality and useful Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of stream channels and floodplains. With time constraints in mind, this approach emphasizes efficient collection of topographic points and lines, adjusting data density based on site complexity. It also provides detailed guidelines for identifying and coding features using description codes.
3. Description: The method begins by explaining the purpose of capturing X, Y, and Z coordinates as points and lines to represent a topographic surface. Given time limitations in topographic surveys, it is crucial to collect data efficiently and strategically. Data density depends on site complexity, with more complex areas requiring approximately 1,000-1,200 points compared to simpler planar topography needing around 500-600 points.

Survey points should be placed at locations representing changes in slope or inflection points. Streambed topography should focus on capturing bedforms and avoid roughness elements. Survey points must extend far enough into the floodplain, covering all relevant and non-relevant side channels where lateral migration may occur.

Data is attributed with description codes, such as water surface (ws), mid-channel island (mw), inflow point (in), outflow point (out), and discharge (q). The text also offers a table (Table 7) for identifying and coding survey points and lines throughout the site.

Points are used to capture non-linear features, while lines connect two or more points to efficiently capture identifiable linear features with similar elevations. Examples include water edges, bank tops, and toes. Changes implemented in 2012 added new description codes (ws, mw, in, out, q) to improve the method's capabilities.

4. Target: Efficient and strategic topographic surveying for high-quality DEM creation of stream channels and floodplains.
5. Constraints: Time constraints for data collection, varying site complexities, and reliance on appropriate description codes for accurate feature identification and coding.
