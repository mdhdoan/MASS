  "abstractText": "The stretchof the Snake River between Pittsburg Landing (rkm 345) and Hells Canyon Dam (rkm 398) is proposed as a natural emphasis area to promote a natural-origin population of Snake River fall Chinook salmon for recovery purposes. Currently, the proportions of hatchery and natural-origin fish that spawn in this reach is unknown but the target is>85% natural fish. One approach to determining these proportions is to collect fall Chinook spawner carcasses conduct genetic analyses of their tissue. Since 2015, all hatchery fall Chinook salmon in the Snake River basin are analyzed for PBT (parentage based tagging). The results of tissue analysis can be compared to the database of hatchery fish to determine which fish are hatchery and natural.",
