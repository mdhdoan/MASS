  "abstract": " The CHaMP (Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program) is a comprehensive river basin-wide initiative aimed at assessing the habitat status and trends of salmonids in the Columbia River Basin. Designed around a single protocol with a programmatic approach, CHaMP collects systematic information on habitat conditions using well-established surveying techniques, topographic surveys, and auxiliary data. This data is then integrated with biological response indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of various habitat management strategies.\n\nThe necessity of such a program lies in the importance of understanding how habitat attributes impact specific life history requirements of salmonids managed under the 2008 Biological Opinion (BiOp). Recognizing that interactions at smaller channel unit scales significantly influence fish performance, CHaMP employs hierarchical classification schemes to summarize information across multiple scales.\n\nBy adopting spatially continuous sampling strategies and well-established surveying techniques, CHaMP produces precise topographic surveys from which digital elevation models (DEMs) can be generated. These data are further enriched with auxiliary information like channel classification, fish cover, substrate composition, solar input, water temperature, stream discharge, water chemistry, riparian structure, and human influence to characterize aspects of channel units that influence site-scale fish production potential.\n\nCHaMP brings together methods from various existing protocols while incorporating novel approaches for collecting and analyzing channel geomorphological data. The resulting data fits within a geomorphological hierarchy spanning spatial scales from within-unit topographical features to channel units, geomorphic features, watersheds, and subbasins.\n\nThe obtained stream habitat data is then combined with salmonid growth, survival, abundance, and productivity data to estimate fish-habitat relationships across the Upper Columbia River Basin area. This information helps generate standardized status and trend monitoring data for important Major Population Groups and spatially diverse watersheds of the Columbia River Basin. CHaMP assesses the quantity and quality of stream habitat for salmonids in wadeable, perennial streams below natural impassible barriers within Technical Recovery Team population boundaries across the UCRB.\n\nIn summary, the CHaMP method is crucial in providing a comprehensive understanding of the link between habitat attributes and their direct impact on salmonid fishes managed under the 2008 BiOp. By employing spatially continuous sampling strategies and adopting novel approaches to collecting and analyzing channel geomorphological data, CHaMP helps address the need for accurate, standardized monitoring data required for assessing watershed restoration and management actions in various salmonid populations."

Basin-wide habitat assessment: CHaMP will result in systematic collection and analysis of habitat status and trends information across the Columbia River Basin. This data will be used to evaluate habitat conditions and management strategies for various salmonid populations and their habitats.\n2. Integration with ongoing programs: CHaMP will be integrated with other recovery planning efforts, such as the Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP), allowing for a collaborative approach to fish management across agencies and tribes.\n3.

  "description": " The CHaMP (Columbia River Habitat Monitoring Program) is a basin-wide initiative designed to systematically collect and analyze habitat status and trends information for salmonid fishes managed under the 2008 Biological Opinion (BiOp) in the Columbia River Basin. The program, which was updated in 2014 (version 4), employs a programmatic approach to data collection and management. The CHaMP protocol is structured around a hierarchical understanding of habitat attributes and their relationship to specific life history requirements of salmonids.\n\nThe CHaMP program aims to deliver trends in habitat indicators, which will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts. It will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and management actions for at least one population within each Major Population Group (MPG) identified in RPA 50.6. This implementation will help meet the requirements of RPA 56.3, RPA 57, and RPA 3.\n\nThe CHaMP protocol follows a hierarchical classification scheme adopted from Hawkins et al. (1993), enabling the preservation of site-scale fish habitat production potential characterization while also considering smaller channel-unit and topographical feature scales. This approach recognizes the importance of channel unit interactions on fish performance.\n\nThe protocol employs spatially continuous sampling strategies using well-established surveying techniques, such as conducting precise topographic surveys from which digital elevation models (DEMs) can be produced. These topographic surveys are complemented with auxiliary data, including channel classification, fish cover, substrate composition, distribution and embeddedness, large woody debris (LWD), solar input and water temperature, stream discharge, water chemistry, riparian structure, and site-level human influence.\n\nThe CHaMP protocol combines methods from various existing protocols while incorporating novel approaches to collecting and analyzing channel geomorphological data. The collected data is designed to fit within a geomorphological hierarchy spanning spatial scales ranging from within-unit topographical features to channel units, geomorphic features, watersheds, and subbasins.\n\nUpon obtaining the stream habitat data, it will be applied in conjunction with salmonid growth, survival, abundance, and productivity data to estimate fish-habitat relationships across the Upper Columbia River Basin area. This approach aims to generate standardized status and trend and effectiveness monitoring data for important Major Population Groups and spatially diverse watersheds within the Columbia River Basin to assess the quantity and quality of stream habitat for salmonids in wadeable, perennial streams below natural impassible barriers within Technical Recovery Team population boundaries across the UCRB."
