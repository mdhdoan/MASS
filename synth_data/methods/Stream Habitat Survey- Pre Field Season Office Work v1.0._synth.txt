2. Abstract: The text outlines a method used for gathering and classifying basin information in the context of a survey. This process involves collecting various types of data both before and during the survey, with some work done in the office (such as map work and regional classification) and some performed by field crews (who make relevant comments in their Field Books and on Data Sheets). The purpose of this method is to organize and categorize streams, providing general information for final stream reports.
3. Description: In the context of a survey, basin information is collected beforehand and during the actual survey. Some tasks like map work and regional classification are conducted in the office, meaning they're not directly handled by field crews. However, field crews play an important role as they provide relevant comments about their observations in their Field Books and on Data Sheets. These summaries serve two main purposes: first, they aid in grouping and classifying streams; second, they contribute to the general information included in final stream reports.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to systematically collect and categorize basin information, with a special emphasis on stream classification.
5. Constraints: The main constraint of this method is the division of labor between office workers and field crews; while office staff handle certain aspects like map work and regional classification, field crews are responsible for observing and documenting their findings in Field Books and Data Sheets. This separation may lead to potential coordination issues or miscommunication, which could negatively impact the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the collected data.
