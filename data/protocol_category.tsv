1	"<p>The Northwest Forest Plan, hereafter referred to as &ldquo;the Plan&rdquo;, was approved in 1994. The Plan includes an Aquatic Conservation Strategy that requires the protection, rehabilitation, and monitoring of aquatic ecosystems under the Plan&rsquo;s jurisdiction (U.S. Forest Service, &amp; U.S. Bureau of Land Management, 1994). The Aquatic and Riparian Effectiveness Monitoring Program (AREMP or the monitoring plan) was developed to fulfill these monitoring requirements. The primary purpose of AREMP is to determine the current condition of 6th-field watersheds and track changes in watershed condition over time. A total of 250 watersheds will be monitored under AREMP. One of the most important aspects of the program is the collection of consistent data throughout the Northwest Forest Plan area to provide comparative data used to assess watershed condition.</p>

<p>The field data collected is combined with upslope and riparian information to determine watershed condition. Condition is determined using a decision support model that evaluates individual indicators and then aggregates the evaluation scores. The stream data collected in the field represent about 2/3 of the data included in the decision support model. As natural variance both within and between the watersheds is quite high, it is imperative that errors due to sampling and observer bias are minimized. The data collected will be used as the basis for management decisions throughout the Pacific Northwest. These data comprise one of the largest data sets that exist in the Pacific Northwest, both spatially and temporally. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to make the effort to produce the highest quality data possible. This document is addressed in section 11.1 Standard Operating Procedures of the Quality System Management Plan (Palmer, in prep).</p>

<p>The goal is to efficiently and safely collect the best data possible within a watershed.</p>

Monitoring began prior to the reintroduction in an attempt to assess the pre-management action spatial distribution of spring-Chinook, allowing CJHP to assess the status and progress of the reintroduction efforts. Analysis of eDNA data revealed that while spring-Chinook were listed as extirpated within the Okanogan ESU, the basin likely does have a limited distribution of spring-Chinook. Additionally, PIT tag detections confirm the presence of occasional strays from out of basin.</p>

<p>As a proof of concept, sampling was initiated in 2012 with 5 mainstem Okanogan River sites and 11 Okanogan tributary sites as well as 32 sites throughout the Methow basin (See Laramie et al 2015a and CJHP 2013&nbsp;Annual Report). Sampling was conducted in June and August 2012 at all sites. In 2013, sampling was conducted only in the Okanogan basin, at 8 additional tributary sites not visited during the proof of concept study. These sites were sampled in June and were located in tributary streams with potential for spring-Chinook recolonization. In 2014, all previously sampled sites in the Okanogan basin were re-visited and sampled (US sites on 12-13 July, 2014, and Canada sites on 2 October 2014). See CJHP 2014 Annual Report (appendix C) for results from 2012 thru 2014 eDNA analyses. Several tributaries have produced consistent annual detection of Chinook eDNA, including Shingle Creek, Vaseux Creek, Salmon Creek and Omak Creek. Monitoring eDNA will serve as a resource prioritization tool, indicating which streams may warrant additional, more intensive survey efforts (e.g. electrofishing mark/recapture, snorkle surveys) to obtain density/abundance information, and which stream are not likely utilized by spring-Chinook. Results may also inform habitat rehabilitation/restoration efforts (e.g. removal of barriers to anadromy, habitat improvements).&nbsp;</p>

5	"<p>The Pacific Lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) is an anadromous lamprey species of the Pacific Northwest with populations from Alaska to California. However, the species has suffered severe declines in abundance across its range, including the Columbia Basin. Concern on the part of the Columbia River Treaty Tribes (Close et al 2002) prompted development of the &ldquo;Tribal Pacific Lamprey Restoration Plan for the Columbia Basin&rdquo;. An understanding of the need for improved monitoring as well as the implementation of regional and rangewide restoration efforts was described shortly afterwards in the &ldquo;Conservation Agreement for Pacific Lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) in the States of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California&rdquo; (USFWS 2012). In both documents it was recognized that the population substructure of Pacific Lamprey is poorly understood and represents a critical uncertainty&nbsp;relative to designing restoration efforts.</p>

<p>The situation is complicated by the fact that traditional tagging methods (e.g. fin-clipping, PIT, acoustic, and radio tags, etc.), that have been used to study other fish species, are largely unavailable for use with lamprey, due to the small size of the fish through their extended larval and juvenile life stages. An alternative approach is to analyze the fish genetically &ndash; an animal&rsquo;s genotype providing a natural &ldquo;tag&rdquo; that can be exploited for species identification, to assess population structure, individual-specific identification, and parentage analysis (Matala et al. 2011; Hess et al. 2013; Hess et al. 2014).<br />
<br />
The apparent lack of, or minimal at least, genetic differentiation has offered the possibility of using adult translocation as a means to supplement depressed populations while minimizing the threat of disrupting genetic substructure, such as is strongly observed among salmon populations. The Umatilla, Yakama, and Nez Perce Tribes have each initiated translocation programs in attempts to restore local populations within their ceded territories (Umatilla Tribe, BPA 1994-026-00; Yakama Nation, BPA 2008-470-00; Nez Perce Tribe, Pacific Lamprey Restoration Project). Additionally, projects to monitor existent populations are being conducted by the Warms Springs Tribe (BPA 2008-308-00 and 2011-014-00) and CRITFC is providing support to these programs, plus additional work through BPA project 2008-524-00.<br />
<br />
In order to better adaptively manage regional lamprey projects, each has associated activities for the collection and counting of lampreys at all life history stages. In order to exploit incorporation of genetic analyses and to provide additional information from fish as they are intercepted during these monitoring activities, the CRITFC project (2008-524-00) included a work element to develop a standardize a suite of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA markers (https://www.monitoringresources.org/Document/Protocol/Details/713) that would provide consistent analyses within and among regional and rangewide lamprey projects. This effort resulted in the establishment of a panel of SNPs for use in fluidigm 96-SNP microarrays (Hess et al. 2015) capable of species identification, understanding physiology and life history of returning adults, calculating effective number of tributary spawners, and evaluating size, age and transformation status of outmigrating juveniles from the tributary environment, among other things.</p>

6	"<p>Many streams in the Pacific Northwest have depleted wood volume due to past human activities such as logging in riparian areas, salvage logging of wood in streams, splash-dams, and misguided attempts to remove perceived obstructions to salmon migration.&nbsp; In addition, streams have been modified and simplified due to agriculture and urban development.&nbsp; This process has reduced channel complexity, isolated main stem habitats from side-channels and floodplains, reduced cover for aquatic species, and altered channel morphology.&nbsp; Instream structures can be used to create pools, increase habitat complexity, reduce sediment transport, trap gravel needed for spawning, stabilize stream channels, provide food for aquatic invertebrates, and provide stream nutrients, increasing overall stream productivity (Roni and Quinn 2001). As a result, installation of instream structures, particularly placement of large woody debris (LWD), has become one of the longest used and most common techniques for improving fish habitat and mitigating human-caused degradation (Roni and Quinn 2001; Roni et. al. 2005).&nbsp; Use of instream structures began as early as the 1930&rsquo;s in the Midwest and has been adapted to the higher gradient systems in the Pacific Northwest (Roni et al. 2005).</p>

<p>The effectiveness of instream structures in enhancing habitat has been debated due to the lack of evaluation, as well as confounding results due to improper structure placement and lack of documentation of effects on factors directly limiting habitat quality (Roni et al. 2005). Calls to better evaluate habitat improvement projects began in the early 1980s (Reeves and Roelofs 1982), and continued throughout the 1990s (Reeves et al. 1991; Chapman 1996; Kauffman et al. 1997). Others have suggested the approach to restoration should shift to protecting high-quality habitats and restoring connectivity and watershed processes before implementing instream habitat improvement projects (Roni et al. 2008; Frissell and Nawa 1992), or focusing on restoring riparian forests with trees large enough to replenish LWD naturally in the system over time (Collins and Montgomery 2002). The need for additional effectiveness monitoring and evaluation is widely apparent in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

7	"<p>Net&nbsp;primary production&nbsp;is a fundamental ecological process that reflects the amount of carbon synthesized within an ecosystem which is ultimately available to consumers (Davies,&nbsp;Bunn, and Hamilton 2008). By selecting the appropriate environmental variables in a watershed system, gross primary production (GPP) may be calculated in stream ecosystems, predicting food consumption by a variety of aquatic species. Used as an input in a bioenergetics model, it can aid in making spatially-explicit predictions regarding habitat needs and capacity. Preliminary&nbsp;GPP&nbsp;model development work by Eco Logical Research, Inc. (ELR) has shown promising results using temperature, solar insolation, and electrical conductivity as model inputs for GPP predictions for steelhead populations. This protocol describes the methods for operating the ArcGIS toolsets to calculate solar insolation and electrical conductivity within a watershed&rsquo;s stream network.</p>

<p>Solar insolation directly affects stream temperature (Sinokrot&nbsp;and Stefan, 1993) and the primary productivity of streams (Fisher and Likens, 1973; Hill et al., 1995).&nbsp;Work to date has explored using area solar insolation for the solar input parameter.&nbsp;ELR&nbsp;has&nbsp;developed a preliminary workflow for predicting solar insolation for a stream network, summarizing the average upstream solar insolation values (watt hours per square meter,&nbsp;WH/m&sup2;) per 200-meter stream segments. &nbsp;South Fork Research, Inc. (SFR) is improving this method and automating the solar insolation modeling process through the development of&nbsp;ArcGIS&nbsp;Python tools. Accuracy of solar results were validated using field data collected using&nbsp;SunEye, described in the Solar Input v2.0 Methods associated with this protocol (Bouwes&nbsp;et al. 2011).</p>

<p>Electrical conductivity has been shown to be a potential indicator of aquatic&nbsp;macroinvertebrate&nbsp;species richness (Spieles&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mitsch&nbsp;2000, Brown, Hannah et al. 2007) and also can influence faunal life stages (Tar&iacute;n&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cano&nbsp;2000). By incorporating a previously developed electrical conductivity predictive model (Olson and Hawkins 2012), we built an automated workflow for predicting conductivity for a stream network, summarizing predicted upstream conductivity values (&mu;S&nbsp;cm<sup>-1</sup>) per 1000-meter stream segments.</p>
