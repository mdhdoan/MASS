2. Abstract: Weirs are long-standing structures used to capture and count migrating fish in streams and small rivers. They provide accurate absolute counts of escapement, crucial for stock assessment and fishery management. Although limited by construction expense, navigation barriers, and clogging with debris, weirs remain the most reliable method for quantifying fish migration. Weirs also offer opportunities for observation, sampling, recapture, and broodstock collection. The use of weirs involves year-round preparation, permits, and land-use agreements.

3. Description: Weirs are porous barriers constructed across streams to capture migrating fish. Historically used by indigenous peoples like the Netsilik in Canada and Native Americans along the West Coast, modern applications include terminal fisheries and fish culture. The primary use of weirs is to gather data on age structure, condition, sex ratio, spawning escapement, abundance, and migratory patterns of fish in streams, with a particular focus on adult fish returning to spawn.

Weirs are generally regarded as the most accurate technique for quantifying escapement because they provide absolute counts, unlike modeled estimates that can deviate up to 50-60%. However, their use is limited due to high construction costs, formation of navigation barriers, and the tendency to clog with debris.

Weirs offer additional benefits such as capturing fish for observation, sampling biological characteristics and tissues, serving as recapture sites for basin-wide mark-recapture population estimates, monitoring wild populations, and capturing broodstock for artificial propagation. Field projects require year-round preparation, analysis, reporting, maintenance, permits, land-use agreements, and hiring field crews.

4. Target: The primary focus of using weirs is to provide accurate absolute counts of fish migration in streams and small rivers for fisheries management, stock assessment, and data collection on various aspects of fish populations.

5. Constraints: Weir projects face several constraints, including construction expense, formation of navigation barriers, tendency to clog with debris (potentially causing flooding and structure collapse), permit requirements, land-use agreements, and the necessity for year-round preparation, analysis, reporting, and maintenance.
