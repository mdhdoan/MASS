  "abstract": " The text provided outlines a suggested template for documenting electrofishing methods. Electrofishing is a technique used to survey aquatic species by applying an electric current to the water, which disorients fish and allows them to be easily collected for identification and population analysis.\n\nThe template includes several sections to help users customize their electrofishing method documentation:\n\n1. Objective/Purpose: Users are asked to identify the goal of their program (such as management survey or species presence-absence) and why they have chosen to use electrofishing to achieve that objective.\n2. Method Description: This section includes questions related to the title, affiliation, and contact information for the study.\n3. Specifications: Users are asked to provide details about the electrofishing equipment, such as the type of boat or vessel being used, the voltage and current settings, and any additional accessories.\n4. Safety: The template includes important safety considerations, such as precautions for operating the electrofishing equipment around other people and potential hazards in the water.\n5. Quality Control: Users are encouraged to ensure accurate data collection by using standardized methods and procedures, and to document any issues that may arise during the survey.\n\nBy following this template, users can ensure that their electrofishing method is well-documented and standardized, which is important for ensuring consistent and reliable results. The use of electrofishing helps address challenges associated with surveying aquatic species in large bodies of water, such as difficult access or low visibility, while minimizing potential harm to the fish population."

  "description": " This text provides guidance for users looking to create a custom electrofishing method documentation using a suggested template. The template includes various questions designed to help standardize the reporting of electrofishing methods, with some multiple-choice components. The intent is not to force standardized responses but rather to establish consistent formatting.\n\nFirst, users need to identify their objective or purpose (Objective/Purpose) for conducting the electrofishing survey. Multiple options are available, such as Species Presence-Absence, Specimen Collection, Relative Abundance (CPUE), Absolute Abundance (mark-recapture), Population Dynamics (recruitment, growth, mortality), and other specific objectives that can be filled in the blank provided.\n\nThe reason for choosing electrofishing to achieve this objective (Why are you using electrofishing?) is also essential to document. This information helps contextualize the importance of using electrofishing in your research or monitoring program.\n\nUsers should provide Title/Affiliation/Program names, along with contact details like email addresses and phone numbers for future communication or references. These details ensure accountability and traceability of data and results."

  "constraints": " Based on the provided text body, here are the identified constraints and their locations:\n\n1. Standardization of electrofishing method documentation: This constraint is stated in the background section, where it's mentioned that the intent is to standardize how an electrofishing method is documented, not to standardize responses to the questions.\n2. Obtaining correct answers: This constraint is stated in the instructions for multiple choice questions, where users are advised not to guess if they don't know the answer and instead obtain the correct answer from helpful sources.\n\nThere are no identified constraints with code in this text body."
