 1. Abstract:
This text describes a plan to monitor and gather data on steelhead trout populations in the Asotin and Tucannon rivers in Washington State. The goal is to determine adult abundance, proportion of hatchery-origin fish, population age structure, and distribution of steelhead in the river tributaries. This information will be used for recovery efforts under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes:
Values: Conservation of steelhead trout populations, meeting ESA recovery goals.
Problem Statement: Uncertainty regarding adult steelhead abundance, distribution, and hatchery origin in unsampled tributaries, and the impact on ESA recovery efforts.
Desired outcomes: To collect data on adult steelhead abundance, hatchery-origin fish, population age structure, and distribution to meet ESA recovery goals.
3. Description:
The text outlines a plan for monitoring steelhead trout populations in the Asotin and Tucannon rivers using adult traps to gather data. The proposed project will provide information on adult abundance, proportion of hatchery-origin fish, population age structure, distribution, and contribute to genetic characterization of Snake River Basin steelhead. The monitoring plan includes specific objectives, target populations, and constraints for the study.
4. Objectives:
The objective is to gather data on adult steelhead abundance, proportion of hatchery-origin fish, population age structure, and distribution in the Asotin and Tucannon river tributaries.
Summary of Solution Coverage: The objective covers all aspects of the problem statement, including uncertainty regarding adult steelhead abundance, distribution, and hatchery origin in unsampled tributaries.
Keywords: Steelhead trout, adult abundance, hatchery-origin fish, population age structure, river tributaries, ESA recovery.
5. Target: Monitoring and gathering data on steelhead trout populations in the Asotin and Tucannon rivers.
6. Constraints: The proposed project is subject to certain constraints, including adequate funding for DNA and SNPs analyses, and the availability of adult steelhead for tissue sampling at trap sites/streams. Additionally, the success of the project depends on the ability to install, maintain, and operate adult traps, accurately enumerate migrating adult steelhead, and properly collect tissue samples for genetic analysis.
