 1. Keywords: Estimate, fish cover, channel unit, refuge, salmonids, undercut bank, stand alone method.
2. Abstract: The text describes a method for estimating the type and total area of cover available to fish within channel units. Fish cover is defined as the proportion of the channel unit area that provides refuge to salmonids. In 2012, the method was updated by removing undercut bank estimates and instead treating undercut as a stand-alone method. This improvement in the method ensures more accurate and precise estimation of fish cover.
3. Description: The text presents a method for estimating fish cover within channel units, which is critical for understanding and managing fish populations. Fish cover refers to the proportion of the channel unit area that offers refuge to salmonids. In 2012, changes were made to this method by removing undercut bank estimates and treating undercut as a separate method. This modification allows for more accurate and focused estimation of undercut as a form of fish cover.
4. Target: The primary focus of the method is to estimate the type and total area of cover available to fish within channel units, specifically for refuge areas used by salmonids.
5. Constraints: The constraints of the current method include the need for accurate data on undercut banks and their relation to fish populations, as well as the need for a clear understanding of what constitutes a refuge area for salmonids. Additionally, the success of this method relies on regular updates and improvements based on new research findings and technological advancements.
