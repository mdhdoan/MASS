2. Abstract: Stomach lavage is a method used to analyze the diet of live fish by dislodging and extracting stomach contents through regurgitation. This technique is crucial for understanding fish diet composition, which can be further examined to determine prey selectivity, consumed prey amounts, and energy content. The methods described are applicable to fish six inches or larger, with success dependent on species and the use of anesthesia.
3. Description: Stomach lavage, a method involving the displacement and extraction of stomach contents from live fish using a steady stream of water, assists in studying diet composition. Analyzing diet composition can further reveal information about prey selectivity, quantities of different prey consumed, and energy content of consumed prey. This technique is applicable for fish six inches or larger, with success influenced by the species being studied and whether anesthesia is used. Research conducted by Nelle (1999) and Naughton et al. (2004) showed that anesthesia was not required when performing stomach lavage on smallmouth bass.
4. Target: The primary goal of stomach lavage in fish is to analyze diet composition for insights into prey selectivity, consumed prey amounts, and energy content.
5. Constraints: The effectiveness of stomach lavage depends on the species of fish being studied and may require the use of anesthesia. This method is applicable only to fish six inches or larger.
