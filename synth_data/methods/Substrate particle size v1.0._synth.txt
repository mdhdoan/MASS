2. Abstract: This method focuses on calculating metrics for streambed substrate particle size, which are essential in characterizing channel roughness for hydraulic modeling and as general descriptors of stream channel quality and diversity. Understanding these metrics can help assess the ecological health and physical properties of waterways, supporting effective management and conservation strategies.

3. Description: The text body discusses the importance of quantifying streambed substrate particle size to determine channel roughness in hydraulic modeling. Channel roughness significantly impacts fluid flow and sediment transport, which are critical factors in understanding river morphodynamics and ecological health. By analyzing streambed particle sizes, researchers can also evaluate stream channel quality and diversity, providing valuable insights for managing aquatic ecosystems.

4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to establish a reliable approach for measuring streambed substrate particle size as a key factor in hydraulic modeling and stream channel assessment.

5. Constraints: Several constraints may affect the accuracy and applicability of this method, such as varying environmental conditions, limited access to sampling sites, and the need for specialized equipment or expertise to analyze particle sizes accurately. Additionally, the method's effectiveness might be influenced by local geological factors, human activities, or temporal changes in streambed composition.
