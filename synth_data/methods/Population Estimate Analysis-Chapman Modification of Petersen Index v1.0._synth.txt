2. Abstract: The mark-recapture method is a common technique for estimating populations, with the Peterson index being one of its simplest forms. However, this approach can be biased if only a few individuals are sampled. To address this issue, the Chapman modification is employed when sampling is conducted without replacement. This article describes how to use the Chapman estimator to analyze data from mark-recapture population estimates in Lake Pend Oreille and calculate population and exploitation estimates.
3. Description: The text discusses the mark-recapture method, specifically focusing on the Peterson index, which is a simple yet potentially biased approach for estimating populations. When sampling is carried out without replacement, the Chapman modification is utilized to correct this bias. This technique is based on the idea of analyzing data from mark-recapture efforts while taking into account that individual fish are removed after examination. The article details how the Chapman estimator can be applied in Lake Pend Oreille's context to compute both population and exploitation estimates.
4. Target: The primary focus is to demonstrate the use of the Chapman modification to the Peterson index for accurate mark-recapture population estimation.
5. Constraints: A key constraint for this method is that it requires careful sampling without replacement, meaning fish must be removed after examination to avoid double-counting. This can be challenging in practice and may introduce additional variability or errors if not executed properly.
