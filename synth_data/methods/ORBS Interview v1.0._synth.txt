2. Abstract: This method utilizes a handheld computer with a specially designed program to conduct dockside interviews with fishers. The program ensures all necessary data is collected and errors are minimized through prompts for unexpected data. At the end of each day, a data summary program is run and results are transferred to a two-sided summary form, providing essential information in case of handheld computer failure and enabling mid-week updates on fisheries. The final step involves expanding interview data to the fishing population within each strata.
3. Description: The method employs a handheld computer with an ORBS-developed program for dockside interviews, which assists in gathering pertinent data and minimizing errors through prompts for unexpected data values. Interview data includes information on species, catch weight, fishing gear used, and more (as detailed in Table 1). Additional specialized data elements are collected occasionally but not part of the standard ORBS interview. At the end of each workday, a data summary program is run to create a two-sided summary form containing essential information from the interviews for potential handheld computer failure and providing updates on quota fisheries for mid-week assessments. The final step includes making separate estimates and expansions for charter boats and private/guide boats due to different effort estimation methods.
4. Target: Efficient, accurate collection and summary of dockside interview data for monitoring and managing fishery quotas.
5. Constraints: The primary constraint lies in the potential failure of handheld computers and the need to recreate data using the minimal information provided on the two-sided summary form. Additionally, the method requires consistent implementation of the data collection program and compliance with end-of-day summary requirements.
