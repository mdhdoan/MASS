 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the five highly relevant keywords relevant to the method described in the text body:

1. Juvenile salmonid density
2. Standardized measure
3. Snorkel survey
4. River Bathymetry Toolkit (RBT)
5. Wetted polygon area

Now, let's move on to the next sections:

2. Abstract:
Juvenile salmonid density is an essential metric for monitoring and managing fish populations in aquatic ecosystems. A standardized measure of juvenile salmonid abundance is necessary to compare datasets from sampling reaches of different areas. This method describes how to calculate the number of juvenile Chinook, coho, and steelhead salmonids per square meter within each reach. The method involves querying snorkel survey results for fish of each species that are less than 250 mm in length. Water surface area can be reported from the River Bathymetry Toolkit (RBT) as the area of the wetted polygon if a topographic survey is conducted at the same time as the snorkel survey, or calculated by field measurements of the length of stream sampled and several wetted width measurements.
3. Description:
The method for calculating juvenile salmonid density involves a standardized measure of juvenile salmonid abundance. The number of observed salmonids is divided by the area sampled, allowing for the comparison of datasets from sampling reaches of differing areas. The response variables for juvenile fish are calculated in the same way for Chinook, coho, and steelhead par. The metric used is number of fish per square meter within each reach. The number of fish is found by querying the snorkel survey results for fish of each species that are less than 250 mm in length. Water surface area can be reported from the River Bathymetry Toolkit (RBT) as the area of the wetted polygon if a topographic survey is conducted at the same time as the snorkel survey, or calculated by field measurements of the length of stream sampled and several wetted width measurements as described in Method ID: 293.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide a standardized measure of juvenile salmonid abundance that can be used to compare datasets from sampling reaches of different areas.
5. Constraints:
One constraint for this method is the availability and accuracy of snorkel survey results, which are used to determine the number of juvenile fish present in each reach. Additionally, the calculation of water surface area may require a topographic survey or field measurements, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
