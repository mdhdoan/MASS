{
  "backgroundRationale": "<p>The ISEMP has designed a robust and flexible implementation and monitoring strategy that will implement the full suite of restoration actions in the lower 26 miles of the Entiat River in a 10-year time period, maximize the resolution of effects from different action types and reveal multi-scale mechanisms (e.g., effects of action types, geomorphic reaches, landuse), and detect a response at a lower resolution (i.e., watershed scale) if a higher resolution is not possible due to, for example, implementation of restoration actions outside the experimental design. This dsign is described in the Entiat IMW Implementation Stategy, Appendix B to the Upper Columbia Implementation Strategy (Hillman. 2006). The Entiat IMW will answer the following questions: 1) Did habitat restoration improve freshwater productivity at the watershed scale? 2) What was the impact of the varying restoration types? (Supports the Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Board&rsquo;s Adaptive Management Framework). 3) What were the mechanisms by which physical habitat changes improved freshwater productivity? The goals of the Entiat IMW are to: 1) Determine if the implementation of proposed instream and side-channel habitat restoration actions between river miles 0 and 26 significantly improve the abundance and productivity of spring Chinook and steelhead, two of four Viable Salmonid Population metrics (VSP, McElhany et al. 2000) used to measure &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; as identified in the Recovery Plan (UCSRB 2007). 2) Determine if the implementation of proposed instream and side-channel habitat restoration actions between river miles 0 and 26 significantly improve metrics specified in the 2008 FCRPS BiOp.</p>\r\n",
