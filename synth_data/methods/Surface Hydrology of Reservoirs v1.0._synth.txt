2. Abstract: This method involves deriving minimum elevation and Water Residence Time (WRT) to describe the extent of annual drawdown in a body of water, such as Lake Roosevelt. By comparing these values between years, it is possible to understand the impact of deeper drawdowns on the surface area and near-shore habitats. This knowledge can help manage the hydrologic system and its lake-river dynamics, which are affected by elevated Total Dissolved Gas (TDG) levels, increased nutrient flux, shorter WRT, reduced water clarity, and decreased primary and secondary production.
3. Description: The text discusses a method for analyzing the annual drawdown in a body of water, specifically Lake Roosevelt. Two key metrics are used to describe this process: minimum elevation and Water Residence Time (WRT). By comparing these values between years, researchers can determine the impact of deeper drawdowns on surface area and near-shore habitats. The text also highlights how these changes affect the hydrologic system, leading to altered lake-river dynamics with increased TDG levels, enhanced nutrient flux, shorter WRT, reduced water clarity, and decreased primary and secondary production.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to analyze and compare annual drawdowns in a body of water across different years, assessing their impact on the hydrologic system and associated habitats.
5. Constraints: Some constraints for this method could include limited data availability, potential errors or inconsistencies in data collection, and challenges related to accurately modeling complex lake-river dynamics.
