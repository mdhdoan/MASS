  "abstractText": "In 1998 two programs were developed to address aquatic and riparian monitoring needs throughout the upper Columbia River Basin. These programs include; (Pacific Anadromous Fish Strategy (PACFISH) and Inland Fish Strategy (INFISH) This method was derived from a PACFISH/INFISH riparian sampling protocol and includes instructions for measuring greenline vegetation. The concept of the greenline as a location to sample and monitor streamside vegetation was presented by Winward (2000) who described it as the first perennial vegetation ... on or near the water's edge. The greenline is a useful location to measure vegetation along streams because it is the dynamic interface of the stream and terrestrial ecosystems. The objective of greenline data is to describe vegetation and ground cover adjacent or nearest the stream.",
