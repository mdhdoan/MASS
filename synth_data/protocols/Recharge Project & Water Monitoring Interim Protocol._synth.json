  "abstract": " In order to effectively manage and protect the water resources in an alluvial aquifer system that is frequently connected to surface water, groundwater monitoring is essential. This process helps us understand how the hydrologic system operates by correlating groundwater levels with areas of high seepage loss in rivers. By doing so, we can identify where and what type of projects can be implemented to help restore historic groundwater levels and boost stream flows.\n\nThe data collected from this monitoring effort is vital for various studies such as model development, watershed planning, analyzing groundwater-surface water interactions, and more. Groundwater data is obtained through continuous data loggers and manual quarterly measurements at wells. Additionally, surface water temperatures are monitored during the summer, fall, and early winter, while stream flow is quantified using data loggers for analyzing trends and status. The acquired stream flow information is then shared with partners to support their decision-making processes.\n\nGroundwater monitoring plays a crucial role in ensuring sustainable water management by providing critical insights into the interconnectedness of groundwater and surface water resources within an alluvial aquifer system. This information is essential for effective watershed planning, informed decision making, and successful implementation of projects aimed at restoring historic groundwater levels and increasing stream flows."
