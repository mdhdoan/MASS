2. Abstract:
The method described in this text is concerned with measuring the discharge of water flow when traditional methods such as velocity meters or tracer-dilution equipment are not feasible. The method covers high flow, low flow, and unstable flow conditions, providing different techniques for each scenario. For high flow conditions, timed observation of floats is used, while volumetric measurement with a calibrated portable weir plate or Parshall flume is recommended for low flow conditions. In the case of unstable flow conditions such as roll waves or slug flow, photographic techniques are suggested. The text also emphasizes the importance of maintaining and calibrating gaging-station controls in the field to ensure accurate discharge measurements.
3. Description:
The method described in this text is focused on measuring the discharge of water flow when traditional methods are not feasible. The text begins by discussing high flow conditions, where timed observation of floats is used to measure discharge. This involves placing floats in the water and measuring the time it takes for them to travel a known distance. The method then moves on to low flow conditions, where volumetric measurement with a calibrated portable weir plate or Parshall flume is recommended. These devices allow for the precise measurement of water flow by creating a restriction in the flow path that causes the water to rise to a specific height. Finally, the text discusses unstable flow conditions such as roll waves or slug flow, where photographic techniques are suggested.

The text also emphasizes the importance of maintaining and calibrating gaging-station controls in the field to ensure accurate discharge measurements. The transfer of a laboratory discharge rating to a structure in the field requires the existence and maintenance of similitude between laboratory model and prototype, not only with regard to the structure but also with regard to the approach channel. The text notes that the structure and the approach channel must be kept free from accumulations of debris, sediment, and vegetal growth.

The text concludes by mentioning that experience in the U.S.A. has indicated that departure from laboratory conditions is the norm rather than the exception. Therefore, gaging station controls are always calibrated in place by the U.S. Geological Survey. The reader is also referred to publications by the World Meteorological Organization (1971) and the International Standards Organization (1969) for more information on the measurement of discharge using precalibrated controls.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide accurate and precise measurements of water flow in various conditions where traditional methods are not feasible.
5. Constraints:
The main constraints of this method include the need for regular maintenance and calibration of gaging-station controls, the impact of approach channel conditions on discharge measurement, and the need for specialized equipment such as portable weir plates or Parshall flumes. Additionally, the method may not be applicable in certain conditions such as very low flow or highly unstable flow conditions where traditional methods are not feasible.
