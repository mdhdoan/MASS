  "abstractText": "Mass-marking of salmon and steelhead has been an important tool in fisheries management for several decades. Fin marks have been used to identify fish of hatchery origin for harvest in mark-selective fisheries, to identify fish implanted with coded wire tags (CWTs), and in various comparative studies using marks to indicate treatment and control groups. Fin marks can also be used to assess populations, manage broodstock, and identify strays. The most common mark (clip) is complete removal of the adipose fin; ventral (pelvic fin, left or right) fin clips are also common and removal of the maxillary process (left or right) is sometimes used. Fish may also be marked with a variety of fin clip combinations making it important to check the whole fish over when looking for marks.",
