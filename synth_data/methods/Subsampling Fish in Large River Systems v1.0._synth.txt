2. Abstract:
In many fields of study, researchers collect specimens for identification and measurement. However, if too many specimens are collected, it can become difficult to process them all in a timely manner. To address this challenge, researchers can use one of two methods: preservation or subsampling. Preservation involves storing specimens in a fixative until they can be enumerated later, while subsampling involves selecting a representative sample from the larger group for measurement and enumeration. Subsampling is necessary to keep fish alive and to keep sampling time manageable. By using these methods, researchers can ensure that they are able to accurately and efficiently analyze their specimens.
3. Description:
The text describes two methods for managing large numbers of specimens during fieldwork: preservation and subsampling. Preservation involves storing specimens in a fixative until they can be enumerated later, while subsampling involves selecting a representative sample from the larger group for measurement and enumeration. Subsampling is necessary because it allows researchers to keep fish alive and to keep sampling time manageable. The text cites Ratcliff et al. (2014) as defining subsampling as "taking a representative manageable sample from a larger (unmanageable) sample." By using these methods, researchers can ensure that they are able to accurately and efficiently analyze their specimens.
4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to enable researchers to manage large numbers of specimens during fieldwork by using preservation or subsampling.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is the need for access to a fixative for preservation, which may not always be readily available in the field. Additionally, both methods require careful selection and management of samples to ensure accuracy and representativeness.
