  "abstractText": "Floy tags are typically only used for short-term mark and recapture studies, and are most commonly only used on a specific fish species like steelhead or rainbow trout (Persons et al. 2013).The aim of an external tag with internal attachment like thefloytag is to be easily applied and durable, have high retention rates, easily visible, and have little effect on survival, growth, or behavior (McFarlane et al. 1990, Mourning et al. 1994).Floy tags are often accompanied by fin clippingto help identify the individuals that were been tagged but somehow lost their tag(Persons et al. 2013).",
