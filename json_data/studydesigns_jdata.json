The focus of ISEMP implementation in the SFSR is the development and testing of metrics and protocols to support habitat and population status and trend monitoring. Given the passive nature of habitat restoration actions implemented in the SFSR (see SSO1) and current hatchery supplementation effecting two of the three spring/summer Chinook salmon populations (see SSO1), a model-based approach was adopted as a means to partition variance contributed to freshwater productivity from hatchery releases in order to improve our ability to relate freshwater productivity to passive changes in habitat quality and quantity. The SFSR also provides an opportunity to test the impacts of spring/summer Chinook salmon supplementation on freshwater productivity of two listed and un-supplemented steelhead populations. Data collection in the SFSR includes four major components: 1. Probabilistically distributed remote juvenile capture/recapture and tagging efforts. 2. Probabilistically distributed habitat surveys. 3. Operation of rotary screw traps for the purposes of abundance estimation and as a re-sight opportunity for fish tagged in capture/recapture and tagging efforts. 4. Instream PIT tag arrays.</p>\r\n",

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>The ISEMP has designed a robust and flexible implementation and monitoring strategy that will implement the full suite of restoration actions in the lower 26 miles of the Entiat River in a 10-year time period, maximize the resolution of effects from different action types and reveal multi-scale mechanisms (e.g., effects of action types, geomorphic reaches, landuse), and detect a response at a lower resolution (i.e., watershed scale) if a higher resolution is not possible due to, for example, implementation of restoration actions outside the experimental design. This dsign is described in the Entiat IMW Implementation Stategy, Appendix B to the Upper Columbia Implementation Strategy (Hillman. 2006). The Entiat IMW will answer the following questions: 1) Did habitat restoration improve freshwater productivity at the watershed scale? 2) What was the impact of the varying restoration types? (Supports the Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Board&rsquo;s Adaptive Management Framework). 3) What were the mechanisms by which physical habitat changes improved freshwater productivity? The goals of the Entiat IMW are to: 1) Determine if the implementation of proposed instream and side-channel habitat restoration actions between river miles 0 and 26 significantly improve the abundance and productivity of spring Chinook and steelhead, two of four Viable Salmonid Population metrics (VSP, McElhany et al. 2000) used to measure &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; as identified in the Recovery Plan (UCSRB 2007). 2) Determine if the implementation of proposed instream and side-channel habitat restoration actions between river miles 0 and 26 significantly improve metrics specified in the 2008 FCRPS BiOp.</p>\r\n",

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>Because pre-treatment data for much of the fish and habitat responses to fencing do not exist, only post-treatment evaluations can be made. In order to discern patterns from noisy data, we need to provide stark contrasts to illuminate the effects of fencing on streams. The approach ISEMP has used is to find an on-fenced (control) reach on the same stream in very close proximity to the reach that has been fenced (treatment). We believe this is the most appropriate approach to control for factors that affect fish and habitat responses, where differences between treatment and control are driven mainly by changes due to the exclusion of livestock. For example, stream width can be influenced by grazers through trampling of banks and the removal of riparian vegetation. Stream width, however,is also a function of drainage area, geology type, precipitation type and amount, among other factors. Similarly, the abundance of juvenile steelhead is dependent on the number of spawners returning to a stream, which is in part due to out-of- watershed effects such as ocean condition, climatic condition and mainstem experiences. In both examples, these factors are more likely to be similar between treatment and control reaches in close proximity, than if comparison were made between reaches in different streams.</p>\r\n",

    "keyAssumptions": "An extensive review of grazing literature aligned the study&rsquo;s site selection to be based on the following criteria:\r\n- Streams with salmonids. \r\n- The stream must be wadable. \r\n- Knowledge of the history of the exclosure (grazing records). \r\n- Sites are contiguous ungrazed exclosures and unfenced grazed reaches adjacent to each other. \r\n- Sites are not inclusive of or directly adjacent to mining operations or water diversion reservoirs. \r\n- Sites should have limited human implemented restoration (i.e. check dams, logs steps, in-channel structures, rip rap or mass vegetative bank stabilization.) \r\n- No significant tributaries should intervene between the treatment and control reaches. \r\n- Channel reaches shall be as geomorphically similar as possible and shall not have major bedrock constraints. Geomorphic attributes shall include streams with similar valley confinement, valley slope, and elevation. \r\n- For the purposes of our study, landowner permission will play a critical role in site selection. Exclosures in the John Day Basin are installed on both private and public lands. \r\n\r\nWhen exclosures are installed on private lands, the property is leased and maintained by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, but activities outside the realm of routine fence maintenance must be approved by the landowner. After the lease of the enclosure expires, the exclosure reverts back to the sole ownership of the landowner, unless a lease renewal is agreed upon. If the landowner decides to not renew his lease, he may deny any further access to his property.",

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>The Integrated Status and Effectiveness Monitoring Program (ISEMP) is an ongoing collaborative effort to design, test, implement and evaluate Status and Trends Monitoring for salmon and steelhead populations and their habitat and watershed-scale Effectiveness Monitoring for management actions impacting salmon and steelhead populations and habitat in the Interior Columbia River Basin. ISEMP takes a pilot-project approach to the research and development of monitoring by implementing experimental programs in several major subbasins of the Interior Columbia. Population-specific and aggregate estimates of juvenile abundance and survival will be estimated using information obtained from the recapture of juveniles PIT tagged during remote tagging surveys. Recapture data for tagged individuals will be derived from interrogations at extended length PIT tag arrays and from recapture at tributary rotary screw traps. The multi-scale nature of this goal requires the standardization of protocols and sampling designs that are statistically valid and powerful, properties that are currently inconsistent across the multiple monitoring programs in the region. This smolt trapping and trap efficiency monitoring protocol is a component of the overall ISEMP, and while it stands alone as an important contribution to the management of anadromous salmonids and their habitat, it also plays a key role within ISEMP as it is built on a standardized format following Oakley et al. (2003) that all of the ISEMP protocols adhere to. Downstream migrant trapping of juvenile salmonid can be a valuable tool to estimate relative abundance, production, size, survival, migration timing and behavior (Volkhardt et al. 2007). Of significance to status, trend and effectiveness monitoring programs, simple mark-recapture methods can be used with downstream migrant traps to estimate total freshwater production, and enable the estimation of mortality or survival between life stages (e.g., egg-to-smolt).</p>\r\n",

The motivation for the RME Pilot Project has two major components &ndash; consolidation of regional RME planning efforts, and pilot-scale implementation of RME design concepts. At its core, the ISEMP Project is an experimental approach to the development of status, trends and effectiveness monitoring for salmonid populations, habitat characteristics and tributary environment management actions. Thus, the primary motivation is not the implementation of long-term monitoring programs, rather, the development and testing of programs that are supportable in the long-term by the natural resource co-manager community. Thus the major accomplishments of the project will be monitoring approaches that address key management questions and data collection and reduction processes to meet critical regional decision making needs. The primary goal of the Lemhi Effectiveness Project is to identify and quantify the effects of habitat modifications on the productivity and survival of focal anadromous and resident salmonids within the Lemhi watershed. For anadromous species, tributary or reach specific juvenile abundance will be estimated by partitioning recaptures at existing mainstem screw traps. Total abundance will be estimated by the screw traps, and the total estimate will be partitioned to tributaries or reaches. Juvenile survival will be estimated by evaluating overall systemwide recapture efficiency, generated by common PIT tag detections at upper and lower screw traps, and by determining the fraction of fish that passed PIT tag arrays.</p>\r\n",

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>Downstream migrant trapping of juvenile salmonid can be a valuable tool to estimate relative abundance, production, size, survival, migration timing and behavior (Volkhardt et al. 2007). Of significance to status, trend and effectiveness monitoring programs, simple mark-recapture methods can be used with downstream migrant traps to estimate total freshwater production, and enable the estimation of mortality or survival between life stages (e.g., egg-to-smolt) (Volkhardt et al. 2007). The objectives for juvenile trapping activities are to estimate abundance (production), size and condition for populations or subgroups of anadromous salmonid stocks. Additionally, the operation of rotary screw traps provides an opportunity to deploy tags in captured juveniles to estimate out-of-subbasin survival. These goals are consistent with the Upper Columbia Monitoring Strategy (UCMS, Hillman 2006).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The objectives for juvenile trapping activities are to estimate abundance (production), size and condition for populations or subgroups of anadromous salmonid stocks.

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>Stream channel incision is one cause of riparian zone degradation in the arid western United States. Channel incision may be initiated by factors such as major floods, changes in sediment regimes, urban development, and channelization (Rosgen, 1997). As the stream bed becomes progressively deeper, the channel can contain large peak flows and the stream can no longer dissipate energy, water, and materials across its former floodplains (Simon and Rinaldi, 2006). This reduces the area for surface water and groundwater exchange, and aquifer infiltration and water table elevation decline (Brunke and Gonser, 1997). Therefore, streambed degradation is associated with reduced groundwater recharge, reduced reliability and consistency of baseflow, and damaged hyporheic zone connections (Brunke and Gonser, 1997; Cluer and Thorne, 2014). Riparian vegetation that relies on high water tables may also be undercut or stressed (Scott et al., 1999; Shafroth et al., 2000). Ultimately, this impairs stream channel habitat by isolating it from the floodplain, limiting nutrient cycling, and increasing water temperatures (due to lack of shade and poor hyporheic exchange), with negative effects on both in-stream and riparian biota (reviewed in Brunke and Gonser, 1997; Cluer and Thorne, 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Channel incision may be mitigated if beaver return and build dams on streams (Pollock et al., 2007). Pollock et al. (2014) describe how beaver dams can greatly accelerate the channel recovery process by promoting trench widening and aggradation. Beaver dams are an integral part of the restoration strategy currently underway in Bridge Creek, a tributary to the John Day River in eastern Oregon, USA, where channel incision limits habitat quantity and quality for a population of threatened, wild Mid Columbia River steelhead (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) (Pollock et al.<em>, </em>2012 Pollock et al. 2015). In 2009, beaver dam analog (BDA) structures were installed to increase the number and lifespan of beaver dams on Bridge Creek. &nbsp;One hypothesis of the Bridge Creek restoration approach is that water table elevation will increase as surface water elevations rise due to beaver dam impoundments and ongoing sedimentation and bed aggradation (Figure 1); these changes are also expected to enhance groundwater recharge by increasing the duration and extent of floodplain inundation (Pollock et al., 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wells drilled into floodplain surfaces allow&nbsp;access to groundwater, and data loggers can be deployed to monitor&nbsp;hourly changes in temperature and pressure. &nbsp;Pressure changes can be transformed into water table elevation data using computer software.&nbsp;This protocol and methods were used to monitoring changes in groundwater elevation and temperature in two well fields in the Bridge Creek Intensively Monitoring Watershed. One well field is adjacent to a restored reach treated with BDA structures (treatment), while the second well field is adjacent to an unrestored, reference reach (control). The purpose of groundwater monitoring was to determine whether trends in water table elevation and groundwater temperature support the hypothesis that restoration actions enhance groundwater recharge and improve hydrologic connections between the stream and its floodplain, mitigating the effects of channel incision.</p>\r\n",

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>The&nbsp;ISEMP&nbsp;is a collaborative effort to 1) design, test, implement and evaluate Status and Trends Monitoring for salmon and steelhead populations and their habitat and 2) conduct watershed-scale Effectiveness Monitoring for management actions impacting salmon and steelhead populations and habitat in the Interior Columbia River Basin.&nbsp;ISEMP&nbsp;takes a pilot-project approach to the research and development of monitoring by implementing experimental programs in several major&nbsp;sub-basins&nbsp;of the Interior Columbia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annual estimates of abundance and productivity at a variety of scales (e.g., tributary, sub-population, population, Major Population Group [MPG], ESU/DPS) are critical to monitoring the status and trends of listed salmon and steelhead species (McElhaney et al. 2000, Crawford and Rumsey 2011). This protocol describes how the ISEMP uses the observation window located on the Lower Granite Dam (LGR) adult fish ladder and the adult trap at the LGR Adult Fish Facility (LGR) to estimate wild escapement of adult steelhead and sp/sum Chinook salmon migrating past LGR. Moreover, we describe a status, trends, and action effectiveness monitoring program that uses the adult trap at LGR to PIT tag adult steelhead and sp/sum Chinook salmon and uses subsequent upstream interrogations/detections of PIT tagged adults to decompose the escapement past LGR into MPG, population, subpopulation, and tributary estimates of escapement. Tissue and scale samples collected at the time of tagging enable escapement estimates to be further partitioned by sex and age. Estimates of total abundance and abundance by sex and age over time allows estimation of productivity.</p>\r\n",

    "keyAssumptions": "<p>Primarily standard assumptions accompanying mark/recapture models:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. the tagged population is representative of the un-tagged population</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. tagging does not appreciably change behavior or increase mortality&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. tagged individuals have an equal probability of detection</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. tagged individuals do not lose their &#39;mark&#39;</p>\r\n",
    "dataHandlingConsiderations": "<p>Window count data at LGR are provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and are available from the Columbia Basin Research Data Access in Real Time (DART) website (www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/adult_daily). Subsequent PIT tag detection/observation data are available at the PIT Tag Information System (PTAGIS, www.ptagis.org).

    "rolesAndResponsibilities": "<p>Window Count Data: Window observers are responsible for enumerating, by species, fish passing the observation window located on the Lower Granite Dam adult fish ladder during fish counting hours. These operation are overseen by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and made available at the Columbia Basin Research Data Access in Real Time (DART) website (www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/adult_daily). Adult Trap Data: A crew lead, provided by the National Marine Fisheries Service, oversees operation of the Lower Granite Dam adult trap operations. Crew members consist of technicians provided by collaborating agencies involved in trap operation. Crew members are in charge of daily trap operation including processing of all adults captured daily in the adult trap. Crew members visually inspect fish for any visible marks/tags, implant unclipped adult steelhead and sp/sum Chinook salmon into individuals not already containing a PIT tag, measure and record length and weight, collect scale and tissue samples for post-hoc age and genetic analysis, and return fish to the adult ladder to resume upstream migration. All crew members accurately record data on paper and electronic data forms. PIT Interrogation/Detection Data: The majority of upstream PIT tag observation and detection data are collected passively at Instream PIT Tag Detection Systems (IPTDS) operated throughout the Snake River basin. Operation of these IPTDS is overseen by multiple collaborating agencies and are generally managed by fisheries biologists with assistance from fisheries technicians. Data may also be collected at weirs operated by various collaborating agencies; weirs are generally operated by trained fisheries technicians with help from fisheries biologists as needed. Data Analysis: The model to estimate total wild escapement past Lower Granite Dam and Hierarchical Patch Occupancy model are typically run by a biometrician or scientist with an M.S. or PhD in Fishery Sciences or related field.</p>\r\n",
    "qualifications": "<p>Adult Trap Data: The crew lead at the Lower Granite Dam adult trap ladder is generally and experienced fish biologist with experience handling and processing large numbers of salmonids. Trap technicians are hired by a variety of collaborating agencies and are generally fisheries technicians attending college or with a B.S. in natural resources, fisheries, or a related field. Fisheries technicians should be organized and have excellent fish handling and data recording skills. Operators and maintainers of IPTDS are generally fisheries biologists with experience in installation and operation of IPTDS. Fisheries technicians may also assist with installation and maintenance of IPTDS. The models to estimate total wild escapement past Lower Granite Dam or the Hierarchical Patch Occupancy Model to estimate escapement to locations throughout the Snake River basin are generally developed by a biometrician or scientist with a background in statistics, mark-recpature models, model fitting, etc and with experience in computer programming.</p>\r\n",
    "trainingRequirements": "<p>Window observers at the Lower Granite Dam adult fish facility should be trained and well experienced at identifying fish by species. The crew lead at the LGR Adult Fish Facility should be well trained and experienced in fish handling, processing, and data collection and have excellent leadership and problem solving skills. The crew lead should provide training to crew members working at the facility. Crew members are generally technicians with training and experience in fish handling and data recording. Fisheries technicians should have excellent data recording skills. Operation of the models to estimate total wild escapement at LGR and escapement to locations throughout the Snake River basin are generally biometricians or scientists with a strong statistical background and an M.S. or PhD in Fishery Sciences or a related field.</p>\r\n",
    "safetyConsiderations": "<p>Operation of the adult trap at LGR may occur during harsh weather (cold, snow, rain, lightning) and caution should be taken during those times. Also, during periods when many fish are being handled at the trap operations may be hectic and precautions should be taken to ensure the safety of technicians and to those around them. Floors and surface may be slick and appropriate footwear should be worn. Precautions should also be taken when anesthetizing, handling, and tagging adult salmonids to minimize potential mortality of captured individuals.</p>\r\n",
    "fieldScheduleNotes": "<p>Fish captured in the LGR adult fish trap MUST be processed daily each day that the trap gate is operated. Ideally, the trap is operated throughout the migration season. The fish ladder is generally dewatered in December and through Jan/Feb. IPTDS are generally operated year-round and maintenance may be needed at any time throughout the season.</p>\r\n",
    "budgetConsiderations": "<p>IPTDS are operated throughout the entire Snake River basin, and thus, travel to and maintenance of IPTDS sites may incur unforeseen costs. Equipment at the LGR adult trapping facility are extensive and operation and maintenance of the facility occurs throughout most of the year.</p>\r\n",

These sites are co-located with the habitat monitoring annual panel sites proposed under the Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program (CHaMP; BPA Project&nbsp;2011-006). All fish monitoring data will be subjected to standard QA/QC processes and uploaded to PTAGIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This monitoring will result in the collection and analysis of systematic anadromous salmonid&nbsp;status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide population trends.&nbsp; When coupled with habitat data, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This protocol describes techniques used to capture, handle and PIT tag fish and includes Electro Fishing, Snorkeling, Angling and Dip-net/Seining as the major capture methods. The use of Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags to support status and trend and effectiveness monitoring for listed juvenile&nbsp;spring Chinook and steelhead in the Upper Columbia has increased significantly over the past 5 years as the technology associated with passive detection of tags in the tributary environment and the coverage afforded by&nbsp;instream&nbsp;PIT tag detection arrays has improved. Data from PIT-tagged juveniles can be used to monitor the response of fish to habitat restoration actions and the status and trend of populations through survival, growth and abundance. &nbsp;PIT tag data also allows us to characterize the movement patterns of tagged fish, supporting estimations of residency time, migration timing, and habitat use if the detection infrastructure is sufficient. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Fundamental to this work is the task of building models that are structurally and/or numerically consistent with the scales of relevant biological processes and management actions (<a href=\"#_ENREF_23\" title=\"Green, 2005 #169\">Green et al., 2005</a>). For species like Pacific salmon and steelhead (<em>Oncorhynchus</em> spp.), this is especially challenging given that they respond to factors operating at widely varying spatial and temporal scales. For example, the foraging success, growth, and survival of individuals can be influenced by conditions within small (10-100 m<sup>2</sup>) patches of stream habitat (<a href=\"#_ENREF_52\" title=\"Rosenfeld, 2009 #244\">e.g., Rosenfeld and Taylor, 2009</a>), yet a river&rsquo;s overall capacity to produce juvenile fish may be set by a habitat limitation for another life stage that is governed by broader-scale geomorphic controls (e.g., spawning, <a href=\"#_ENREF_10\" title=\"Buffington, 2004 #171\">Buffington et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#_ENREF_49\" title=\"Palm, 2007 #170\">Palm et al., 2007</a>). Similarly, global climatic phenomena (e.g., El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation) can affect the survival of salmon during marine life stages (<a href=\"#_ENREF_58\" title=\"Sharma, 2013 #172\">e.g., Sharma et al., 2013</a>) to an extent that makes it difficult to detect the effects of other factors (<a href=\"#_ENREF_55\" title=\"Schaller, 2013 #166\">e.g., Schaller et al., 2013</a>). Accordingly, there is a great need for modelling approaches that can accurately depict complex life histories and simultaneously maximize the realism of species&ndash;environment relationships for life stages targeted by management/restoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite a rich history of life-cycle model (LCM) applications to salmon recovery-related questions (<a href=\"#_ENREF_22\" title=\"Good, 2007 #168\">see Good et al., 2007 for a recent review</a>), previous attempts to link habitat restoration scenarios with future population performance have met with limited success. For example, studies have quantified population responses to hypothetical survival increases assumed to be achievable through habitat restoration, but without explicit consideration of current conditions and/or restoration feasibility (<a href=\"#_ENREF_32\" title=\"Kareiva, 2000 #227\">e.g., Kareiva et al., 2000</a>).

The realism of LCMs has thus improved greatly, yet these tools continue to inform restoration practice at a coarse level of resolution only (e.g., current condition vs. historic potential) and in the absence of mechanistic insight on fish&ndash;habitat associations.

Similarly, global climatic phenomena (e.g., El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation) can affect the survival of salmon during marine life stages (<a href=\"#_ENREF_58\" title=\"Sharma, 2013 #172\">e.g., Sharma et al., 2013</a>) to an extent that makes it difficult to detect the effects of other factors (<a href=\"#_ENREF_55\" title=\"Schaller, 2013 #166\">e.g., Schaller et al., 2013</a>). Accordingly, there is a great need for modelling approaches that can accurately depict complex life histories and simultaneously maximize the realism of species&ndash;environment relationships for life stages targeted by management/restoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite a rich history of life-cycle model (LCM) applications to salmon recovery-related questions (<a href=\"#_ENREF_22\" title=\"Good, 2007 #168\">see Good et al., 2007 for a recent review</a>), previous attempts to link habitat restoration scenarios with future population performance have met with limited success. For example, studies have quantified population responses to hypothetical survival increases assumed to be achievable through habitat restoration, but without explicit consideration of current conditions and/or restoration feasibility (<a href=\"#_ENREF_32\" title=\"Kareiva, 2000 #227\">e.g., Kareiva et al., 2000</a>).

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>In-stream PIT tag Detection Systems (IPTDS) have been installed across the Columbia River Basin for the purpose of estimating juvenile and adult abundance, survival, and distribution. For most applications individual tag detections have limited value without accompanying information about detection probability (i.e., fraction of PIT tags that may have transited an array without detection). This protocol describes how standard diagnostic data can be reported and utilized to support estimates of detection probability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this protocol, we assume that IPTDS are intended to operate in a temporally continuous manner for a given time period (i.e., 365 days/year; during the spawning migration, etc.). We also assume that the analysis of interrogation data requires the ability to estimate detection probabilities. Given these assumptions it is critical that site diagnostic and detection data can be accessed in near-real-time. In other words, periods of in-operation resulting from equipment or power failures are assumed to be detrimental.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although IPTDS are typically installed to address the information needs of a specific project, interrogation data from IPTDS are often leveraged in other forums or designs. In order for IPTDS interrogation data to be useful for meta-analyses, users without specific familiarity with a given IPTDS must be able to assess the statistical reliability of the interrogation data. IPTDS site metadata standards are enforced by IPTDS registration as a &ldquo;small-scale site&rdquo; in the PIT Tag Information System (PTAGIS; www.ptagis.org). PTAGIS displays IPTDS site maps, summarizes IPTDS infrastructure, and allows for &ldquo;event log&rdquo; entries that describe system failures and alert data consumers to potential gaps in information resulting from site failure or routine periods of in-operation. The site maps displayed in PTAGIS can be used to determine whether detection data are sufficient to meet the assumptions of commonly-used statistical analyses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This protocol also requires the use of routine diagnostic and interrogation file downloads from a given IPTDS. We recommend a daily download interval, which typically requires the use of a cellular or satellite modem. Routine download and review of diagnostic and interrogation data provides advanced warning of impending system failure, thus reducing repair costs, and reduces the potential for lost data resulting from system failure. Analyzing and interpreting diagnostic data from IPTDS system components can be challenging. We recommend using a commercially available service that automates data downloads, performs routine data summaries, and provides automated email or text alerts when diagnostic data indicate potential system failures (e.g., the Biomark, Inc. &ldquo;Data Manager&rdquo; service).</p>\r\n",

In order to generate reliable data, it is critical that site diagnostics and interrogation data are downloaded on a continuous and routine basis; preferably daily. It is often most cost-effective to utilize cellular, satellite, or Ethernet modems to download data, particularly for IPTDS in remote locations. Data is uploaded into PTAGIS (http://www.ptagis.org/)</p>\r\n",
    "qualityControlConsiderations": "<p>We strongly recommend the use of commercially available software (e.g., Biomark, Inc. &quot;Data Manager&quot;) to manage IPTDS interrogation and diagnostic data. The process of converting standard site downloads into PTAGIS upload files is reasonably straightforward, but can be time consuming; doing so also introduces the potential for human error. Additionally, site diagnostic data are voluminous and may be difficult to interpret. The commercially available service referenced here automates the reduction and display of these data in a user-friendly format and generates email alerts when diagnostic data indicate potential system failure. Data is recorded and uploaded, if there is a misread the data does not get uploaded (QA/QC done by BioMark)</p>\r\n",
    "reportingConsiderations": "<p>It is crucial that IPTDS operators consistently maintain their site metadata in PTAGIS. Changes in site &quot;architecture&quot; (i.e., location of antennas within the stream channel), infrastructure, and periods of system failure all must be known to analyze interrogation data.

ISEMP&nbsp;takes a pilot-project approach to the research and development of monitoring by implementing experimental programs in several major subbasins of the Interior Columbia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To achieve these goals, population-specific and aggregate estimates of juvenile abundance and survival are necessary. These metrics will be estimated using information from the recapture of juveniles that are PIT tagged during remote tagging surveys or&nbsp;at rotary screw traps. Recapture data for tagged individuals will be obtained interrogations at Instream PIT Tag Detection Systems (IPTDS) and from recapture at rotary screw traps. ISEMP operated rotary screw traps in the South Fork Salmon and Lemhi rivers to estimate juvenile abundance and survival in those sub-basins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The multiple locations and variable scale nature of this goal requires the standardization of protocols and sampling designs that are statistically valid and powerful. This protocol aims to 1)&nbsp;provide standardization of trapping and fish handling methods among rotary&nbsp;screw traps operated by ISEMP,&nbsp;and 2) provide a brief&nbsp;description of trap efficiency and juvenile abundance estimation methods using rotary screw traps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This monitoring protocol is a component of the overall ISEMP, and while it stands alone as an important contribution to the management of anadromous salmonids and their habitat, it also plays a key role within ISEMP&nbsp;as it is built on a standardized format following Oakley et al. (2003) that all of the ISEMP&nbsp;protocols adhere to. Downstream migrant trapping of juvenile salmonids can be a valuable tool to estimate abundance, production, size, survival, migration timing and behavior (Volkhardt&nbsp;et al. 2007). Of significance to status, trend and effectiveness monitoring programs, simple mark-recapture methods can be used with downstream migrant traps to estimate total freshwater production, and enable the estimation of survival (and mortality) between life stages (e.g., egg-to-smolt).</p>\r\n",

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>The Bridge Creek watershed is used by a by a run of Mid-Columbia steelhead that are part of the ecologically distinct and ESA (Endangered Species Act) &ldquo;threatened&rdquo; Lower John Day population. It is also used intermittently by Mid-Columbia Chinook salmon, another &quot;threatened&quot; population. Bridge Creek was listed as one of 11 tributary Major Spawning Areas (MaSAs) critical to the recovery of the Lower John Day steelhead Major Population Group (MPG), and was identified as having high restoration potential. Many areas along Bridge Creek have historically experienced high levels of incision, degradation, and high stream temperatures making them inhospitable to salmon populations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFloodplain connectivity and riparian structure were listed as a high restoration priority for the lower valley on Bridge Creek. Re-establishing both surface and groundwater connections between the stream and floodplain increases the amount and quality of fish habitat. Since 2009, beaver dam analogs (BDAs) have been installed in the area, encouraging beaver migration into the area and beaver dam formation. The damming of Bridge Creek has resulted in soil aggradation and floodplain inundation. Floodplain inundation promotes groundwater recharge and water table rise, which in turn support perennial streamflow, cooler water temperatures (due to groundwater upwelling), and riparian vegetation growth. Riparian vegetation provides shade and organic inputs to the stream ecosystem (e.g., prey, woody debris, leaf litter) which improves fish habitat quality. In addition, riparian vegetation is also critical for supporting and maintaining stable beaver colonies, which are an important part of the Bridge Creek restoration strategy. Finally, connected floodplains can also directly provide important off-channel refuge for fish during high flows, expand rearing areas, and increase foraging opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This protocol presents a&nbsp;framework by which to monitor the effectiveness of the Bridge Creek restoration efforts in transforming incised stream networks into&nbsp;healthy, functioning riparian ecosystems. It outlines which&nbsp;vegetative and landscape factors should be measured to determine riparian health. It will also address the restoration methods specific to&nbsp;Bridge Creek, with variables that take into account the impact of&nbsp;BDAs&nbsp;and beaver introduction on floodplain vegetation and landscape structure. By repeating this survey protocol over multiple years, temporal trends in vegetation and landscape may be observed. The survey methods implemented in this protocol are supported by the methodologies outlined in two other government-agency led reports: the multiple indicator monitoring&nbsp;of stream channels and&nbsp;streamside&nbsp;vegetation (MIM&nbsp;2011), and the&nbsp;PACFISH/INFISH&nbsp;effectiveness monitoring program for sampling vegetation in streams and riparian areas (PIBO-EM&nbsp;2008). These two protocols helped guide us in choosing important riparian indicators to measure and allows us to place this effectiveness monitoring protocol in the context of other monitoring studies.</p>\r\n",

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>CHaMP is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010). CHaMP will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring anadromous salmonids and/or their habitat. The implementation of CHaMP will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in RPA 50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of RPA 56.3, RPA 57, and RPA 3. CHaMP was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel (see section 1.6), at least 9 years.</p>\r\n",

    "keyAssumptions": "<p>The protocol is structured around a general understanding of the link between habitat attributes and how they directly relate to the specific life history requirements of the salmonid fishes managed under the 2008 BiOp. These fish are likely not only responding to watershed and reach conditions but also to the conditions of individual channel units within reaches. Recognizing the importance of how interactions at the channel unit scale affect fish performance has led to an increased emphasis on the quantification of this important scale of fish habitat in the CHaMP protocol. We adopted the Hawkins et al. (1993) hierarchical classification scheme that allows for summarization of information across multiple scales. This preserves the ability to summarize information at the site scale as commonly practiced in major fish habitat monitoring programs throughout the Pacific Northwest as well as at the smaller channel-unit and topographical feature scales. The protocol employs spatially continuous sampling strategies using well-established surveying techniques to conduct precise topographic surveys from which digital elevation models (DEMs) can be produced. These topographic surveys are augmented by auxiliary data (e.g., channel classification, fish cover, substrate composition, distribution and embeddedness, large woody debris (LWD), solar input and water temperature, stream discharge, water chemistry, riparian structure, and site-level human influence) that help to characterize aspects of channel units that influence site-scale fish production potential. The CHaMP protocol draws together methods from many existing protocols as well as novel approaches to collecting and analyzing channel geomorphological data. The protocol is designed to collect data that fits within a geomorphological hierarchy spanning spatial scales ranging from within-unit topographical features to channel units to geomorphic to watershed and subbasin scales.</p>\r\n",

The data system will be comprised of field data capture tools and a centralized database with an online interface.  The online interface will support pre-season site evaluations, tracking project metadata, uploading field data, quality assurance procedures, and reporting derived metrics.  Under this plan, data will initially be captured on handheld field computers and then uploaded to the online database when internet connectivity is available.  A standard set of field data capture devices will be provided which will include data entry applications for the topographic and auxiliary habitat surveys.  This two-part system allows remote capture of data and centralized management of metadata, field measurements, and derived metrics.  Collectively, these tools support CHaMP\u2019s data documentation, data capture, data quality, information archiving, standard metric calculation, and project reporting needs. Topographic survey data and auxiliary data will be captured using separate data logger applications.  Auxiliary data (wood loading, substrate composition, etc.) will be capture by a single crew member using a handheld field computer. The topography survey will create a raw topographic point file (x, y, z data) from which several geo-rectified products will be developed using survey (Leica Geo Office) and Arc GIS 10 software.

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>CHaMP is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010). CHaMP will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring anadromous salmonids and/or their habitat. The implementation of CHaMP will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in RPA 50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of RPA 56.3, RPA 57, and RPA 3.

These fish are likely not only responding to watershed and reach conditions but also to the conditions of individual channel units within reaches. Recognizing the importance of how interactions at the channel unit scale affect fish performance has led to an increased emphasis on the quantification of this important scale of fish habitat in the CHaMP protocol. We adopted the Hawkins et al. (1993) hierarchical classification scheme that allows for summarization of information across multiple scales. This preserves the ability to summarize information at the site scale as commonly practiced in major fish habitat monitoring programs throughout the Pacific Northwest as well as at the smaller channel-unit and topographical feature scales. The protocol employs spatially continuous sampling strategies using well-established surveying techniques to conduct precise topographic surveys from which digital elevation models (DEMs) can be produced. These topographic surveys are augmented by auxiliary data (e.g., channel classification, fish cover, substrate composition, distribution and embeddedness, large woody debris (LWD), solar input and water temperature, stream discharge, water chemistry, riparian structure, and site-level human influence) that help to characterize aspects of channel units that influence site-scale fish production potential. The CHaMP protocol draws together methods from many existing protocols as well as novel approaches to collecting and analyzing channel geomorphological data. The protocol is designed to collect data that fits within a geomorphological hierarchy spanning spatial scales ranging from within-unit topographical features to channel units to geomorphic to watershed and subbasin scales.</p>\r\n",

The data system will be comprised of field data capture tools and a centralized database with an online interface.  The online interface will support pre-season site evaluations, tracking project metadata, uploading field data, quality assurance procedures, and reporting derived metrics.  Under this plan, data will initially be captured on handheld field computers and then uploaded to the online database when internet connectivity is available.  A standard set of field data capture devices will be provided which will include data entry applications for the topographic and auxiliary habitat surveys.  This two-part system allows remote capture of data and centralized management of metadata, field measurements, and derived metrics.  Collectively, these tools support CHaMP\u2019s data documentation, data capture, data quality, information archiving, standard metric calculation, and project reporting needs. Topographic survey data and auxiliary data will be captured using separate data logger applications.  Auxiliary data (wood loading, substrate composition, etc.) will be capture by a single crew member using a handheld field computer. The topography survey will create a raw topographic point file (x, y, z data) from which several geo-rectified products will be developed using survey (Leica Geo Office) and Arc GIS 10 software.

CHaMP will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring anadromous salmonids and/or their habitat. The implementation of CHaMP will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in RPA 50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of RPA 56.3, RPA 57, and RPA 3.

Recognizing the importance of how interactions at the channel unit scale affect fish performance has led to an increased emphasis on the quantification of this important scale of fish habitat in the CHaMP protocol. We adopted the Hawkins et al. (1993) hierarchical classification scheme that allows for summarization of information across multiple scales. This preserves the ability to summarize information at the site scale as commonly practiced in major fish habitat monitoring programs throughout the Pacific Northwest as well as at the smaller channel-unit and topographical feature scales. The protocol employs spatially continuous sampling strategies using well-established surveying techniques to conduct precise topographic surveys from which digital elevation models (DEMs) can be produced. These topographic surveys are augmented by auxiliary data (e.g., channel classification, fish cover, substrate composition, distribution and embeddedness, large woody debris (LWD), solar input and water temperature, stream discharge, water chemistry, riparian structure, and site-level human influence) that help to characterize aspects of channel units that influence site-scale fish production potential. The CHaMP protocol draws together methods from many existing protocols as well as novel approaches to collecting and analyzing channel geomorphological data.

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>CHaMP is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010). CHaMP will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring anadromous salmonids and/or their habitat. The implementation of CHaMP will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in RPA 50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of RPA 56.3, RPA 57, and RPA 3. CHaMP was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel (see section 1.6), at least 9 years.</p>\r\n",
    "objectives": [
      "The stream habitat data will be applied in conjunction with salmonid growth, survival, abundance and productivity data to estimate fish-habitat relationships across the Upper Columbia River Basin area",
      "To generate standardized status and trend and effectiveness monitoring data for salmonid habitat in important Major Population Groups and spaitally diverse watersheds of the Columbia River Basin area.",
      "To assess the quantity and quality of stream habitat for salmonids in wadeable, perennial streams below natural impassible barriers within Technical Recovery Team population boundaries across the UCRB"
    ],
    "keyAssumptions": "<p>The protocol is structured around a general understanding of the link between habitat attributes and how they directly relate to the specific life history requirements of the salmonid fishes managed under the 2008 BiOp. These fish are likely not only responding to watershed and reach conditions but also to the conditions of individual channel units within reaches. Recognizing the importance of how interactions at the channel unit scale affect fish performance has led to an increased emphasis on the quantification of this important scale of fish habitat in the CHaMP protocol. We adopted the Hawkins et al. (1993) hierarchical classification scheme that allows for summarization of information across multiple scales. This preserves the ability to summarize information at the site scale as commonly practiced in major fish habitat monitoring programs throughout the Pacific Northwest as well as at the smaller channel-unit and topographical feature scales. The protocol employs spatially continuous sampling strategies using well-established surveying techniques to conduct precise topographic surveys from which digital elevation models (DEMs) can be produced. These topographic surveys are augmented by auxiliary data (e.g., channel classification, fish cover, substrate composition, distribution and embeddedness, large woody debris (LWD), solar input and water temperature, stream discharge, water chemistry, riparian structure, and site-level human influence) that help to characterize aspects of channel units that influence site-scale fish production potential. The CHaMP protocol draws together methods from many existing protocols as well as novel approaches to collecting and analyzing channel geomorphological data. The protocol is designed to collect data that fits within a geomorphological hierarchy spanning spatial scales ranging from within-unit topographical features to channel units to geomorphic to watershed and subbasin scales.</p>\r\n",
    "dataHandlingConsiderations": "The CHaMP data management plan is integral to ensuring successful capture, quality assurance, and archiving of CHaMP field data along with the derivation and reporting of site-level metrics.  The data system will be comprised of field data capture tools and a centralized database with an online interface.  The online interface will support pre-season site evaluations, tracking project metadata, uploading field data, quality assurance procedures, and reporting derived metrics.  Under this plan, data will initially be captured on handheld field computers and then uploaded to the online database when internet connectivity is available.  A standard set of field data capture devices will be provided which will include data entry applications for the topographic and auxiliary habitat surveys.  This two-part system allows remote capture of data and centralized management of metadata, field measurements, and derived metrics.  Collectively, these tools support CHaMP\u2019s data documentation, data capture, data quality, information archiving, standard metric calculation, and project reporting needs. Topographic survey data and auxiliary data will be captured using separate data logger applications.  Auxiliary data (wood loading, substrate composition, etc.) will be capture by a single crew member using a handheld field computer. The topography survey will create a raw topographic point file (x, y, z data) from which several geo-rectified products will be developed using survey (Leica Geo Office) and Arc GIS 10 software.  A triangular irregular network (TIN) and digital elevation model (DEM) will be created as the base topographic products from the survey.  \r\n",

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>CHaMP is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010). CHaMP will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring anadromous salmonids and/or their habitat. The implementation of CHaMP will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in RPA 50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of RPA 56.3, RPA 57, and RPA 3. CHaMP was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel (see section 1.6), at least 9 years.</p>\r\n",
    "objectives": [
      "The stream habitat data will be applied in conjunction with salmonid growth, survival, abundance and productivity data to estimate fish-habitat relationships across the Upper Columbia River Basin area",
      "To generate standardized status and trend and effectiveness monitoring data for salmonid habitat in important Major Population Groups and spaitally diverse watersheds of the Columbia River Basin area.",
      "To assess the quantity and quality of stream habitat for salmonids in wadeable, perennial streams below natural impassible barriers within Technical Recovery Team population boundaries across the UCRB"
    ],
    "keyAssumptions": "<p>The protocol is structured around a general understanding of the link between habitat attributes and how they directly relate to the specific life history requirements of the salmonid fishes managed under the 2008 BiOp. These fish are likely not only responding to watershed and reach conditions but also to the conditions of individual channel units within reaches. Recognizing the importance of how interactions at the channel unit scale affect fish performance has led to an increased emphasis on the quantification of this important scale of fish habitat in the CHaMP protocol. We adopted the Hawkins et al. (1993) hierarchical classification scheme that allows for summarization of information across multiple scales. This preserves the ability to summarize information at the site scale as commonly practiced in major fish habitat monitoring programs throughout the Pacific Northwest as well as at the smaller channel-unit and topographical feature scales. The protocol employs spatially continuous sampling strategies using well-established surveying techniques to conduct precise topographic surveys from which digital elevation models (DEMs) can be produced. These topographic surveys are augmented by auxiliary data (e.g., channel classification, fish cover, substrate composition, distribution and embeddedness, large woody debris (LWD), solar input and water temperature, stream discharge, water chemistry, riparian structure, and site-level human influence) that help to characterize aspects of channel units that influence site-scale fish production potential. The CHaMP protocol draws together methods from many existing protocols as well as novel approaches to collecting and analyzing channel geomorphological data. The protocol is designed to collect data that fits within a geomorphological hierarchy spanning spatial scales ranging from within-unit topographical features to channel units to geomorphic to watershed and subbasin scales.</p>\r\n",
    "dataHandlingConsiderations": "The CHaMP data management plan is integral to ensuring successful capture, quality assurance, and archiving of CHaMP field data along with the derivation and reporting of site-level metrics.  The data system will be comprised of field data capture tools and a centralized database with an online interface.  The online interface will support pre-season site evaluations, tracking project metadata, uploading field data, quality assurance procedures, and reporting derived metrics.  Under this plan, data will initially be captured on handheld field computers and then uploaded to the online database when internet connectivity is available.  A standard set of field data capture devices will be provided which will include data entry applications for the topographic and auxiliary habitat surveys.  This two-part system allows remote capture of data and centralized management of metadata, field measurements, and derived metrics.  Collectively, these tools support CHaMP\u2019s data documentation, data capture, data quality, information archiving, standard metric calculation, and project reporting needs. Topographic survey data and auxiliary data will be captured using separate data logger applications.  Auxiliary data (wood loading, substrate composition, etc.) will be capture by a single crew member using a handheld field computer. The topography survey will create a raw topographic point file (x, y, z data) from which several geo-rectified products will be developed using survey (Leica Geo Office) and Arc GIS 10 software.  A triangular irregular network (TIN) and digital elevation model (DEM) will be created as the base topographic products from the survey.  \r\n",
    "qualityControlConsiderations": "Data quality assurance review will be conducted on a daily basis by crew members and on a weekly basis by the crew supervisor.  The quality assurance review will test for completeness, outliers in numeric data, and outliers in basic summary metrics.  At the end of each day, the crew member will be prompted to verify the number of channel units, total wood pieces, and number of drift samples.  Additionally, the crew will be prompted to review any values recorded as a missing value.  Next the crew will view and verify any numeric outliers. Finally, a short series of graphs will be presented to allow the crew to verify graphical data against their mental image of the site.  At the end of each week, the crew supervisor will perform a similar audit of the data. \r\nData quality assurance for the topographic survey data will take place at four checkpoints within the flow of data from origination on the total station to data storage and web availability.  These checkpoints will reduce the likelihood of data errors compounding throughout data processing.  The four checkpoints are:\r\n1.\tData origination (Total station)\r\n2.\tEnd of day data review (Total station/Data logger)\r\n3.\tEnd of week data processing and review (Laptop)\r\n4.\tCentralized database checks (CHaMP data system)\r\nThe crew lead is responsible for creation and submission of the original point file, a lines file (breaklines), a clean TIN, and a quality assurance report (table in geodatabase).  These should be produced within one week of initial data collection.\r\n",
    "reportingConsiderations": "Site-level metrics will be generated from data submitted to the CHaMP website.  These metrics will be presented in graphical and map format for all sites.  At the end of each field season, crew supervisors will review raw measurements and derived metrics for data completeness, numeric outliers, and ecologic sensibility.  Crew supervisors will be presented a series for graphs through the CHaMP website and asked to verify data quality. ",
    "equipmentCleaningAndCalibration": "Total station and other equipment will be re-calibrated on an annual basis or more frequently as needed. ",
    "rolesAndResponsibilities": "1) The survey crew lays out the site, with two crew members monumenting the bottom of site and working upstream to the top placing transect flagging. The third crew member establishes monuments, benchmarks, control points, and potential survey set-up locations.\r\n2) Once a site has been laid out, two crew members begin surveying the site. A site survey captures channel unit perimeters, maximum pool depths and crested depth, thalweg profile, channel topography, and breaklines establishing the bank and extent of the survey reaching the first floodplain or other elevations beyond the bankfull.\r\n3) The third crew member identifies and flags channel units and collects channel unit-level measurements, including LWD counts, fish cover estimates, and ocular estimates of substrates. Subsurface fines and pebble count measurements are collected in a subset of channel units.\r\n4) The third crew member collects site-level metrics, including drawing the site map, conducting the water quality measurements, taking site and solar pathfinder photos, recording human influences, making riparian estimates, and taking drift net samples.\r\n5) Everyone collects flags once the survey is completed.",
    "qualifications": "Prospective crew members will ideally have a background in biology, preferably in relation to fish, familiarity with GIS, basics of land surveying (e.g., using a total station), and experience living and working in the outdoors. Candidates must be able to work well with others, usually in a crew of 3-6, while enduring long and sometimes arduous days. Camping for multiple days and packing heavy loads of equipment in and out of sites is required periodically. Previous wilderness first aid knowledge is a plus, but not required. ",
    "trainingRequirements": "All crew leaders and members will attend a 10 day pre-season training session. Crew will learn the theoretical background for the CHaMP protocol, proper use and maintenance of all field equipment, and procedures for data management. ",
    "safetyConsiderations": "Each data collection organization will define safety constraints for accessing sites (e.g. sites must be less than 5 trail miles from a trail head and less than 1/2 mile from a trail or road). Sites will be rejected for sampling if the site falls outside these safety constraints. ",

Between 1952 and 1966, harvests of kokanee averaged 1 million kokanee/yr with up to 523,000 angler-hours of fishing pressure (Jeppson 1953; Maiolie and Elam 1993). Additionally, kokanee are the forage base that allows Gerrard rainbow trout in Lake Pend Oreille reach trophy sizes, including the former world record. However, kokanee abundance declined, and in the early 2000s they were at risk of complete collapse (Hansen et al. 2010). High predation rates created by a rapidly expanding lake trout was the primary limiting factor for kokanee, but as a part of kokanee recovery, rainbow trout harvest was also liberalized during 2006-2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kokanee have since rebounded in Lake Pend Oreille, and restrictive harvest regulations have been instituted for rainbow trout that are designed to improve population size structure and re-build the trophy fishery. With restrictive regulations again in place and a resurgent kokanee population, we sample rainbow trout to characterize age and growth rates for this population. Anglers are the most effective tool for capturing rainbows, so we coordinate sampling with fishing derbies. Samples are collected across all sizes of fish in the population. Results are compared to previous work in recent years to evaluate the response of rainbow trout to these changes.</p>\r\n",

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>Terminal fisheries were developed as a means to increase recreational and commercial harvest of hatchery fish while providing greater protection for weak stocks of salmon and steelhead including those protected under the Endangered Species Act.&nbsp; The SAFE project has four current Select Area fishing sites: Youngs Bay, Blind Slough/Knappa Slough and Tongue Point/South Channel in Oregon and Deep River in Washington.&nbsp; Each site provides both recreational and commercial fishing opportunities, although season structure and target species differ with current management goals and production strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being located at the mouth of the Columbia River, albeit in terminal, off-channel areas, the SAFE Program prosecutes mixed-stock fisheries. &nbsp;Fishers from both Oregon and Washington participate in SAFE fisheries (Washington SAFE fishers are allowed to fish in Oregon SAFE sites as well as Deep River in Washington).&nbsp; The SAFE fishery is highly managed so that most SAFE-produced salmon are caught and impacts to ESA-listed stocks are minimized.&nbsp; Few salmon produced by this program escape to hatcheries or streams to spawn; this varies by stock with tule and SAB fall Chinook escapement between 9% and 11% and coho and spring Chinook 4% to 5%, respectively for brood years 2000-2014 (Table 1).&nbsp; While SAFE fishers mostly catch SAFE-produced fish, particularly spring Chinook and coho, there are other Columbia River stocks that are represented in SAFE landings.&nbsp; The winter/spring/summer (WSS) Chinook fishery is an example in which a number of non-SAFE stocks are found in SAFE catch (Table 2).&nbsp; SAFE stocks include spring Chinook and Select Area Bright (SAB) fall Chinook that return early (in June and July).&nbsp; The most critical stock that is caught in the WSS spring Chinook SAFE fishery is the upriver Columbia River spring Chinook because it is the ESA-listed stock that limits SAFE fishers when impacts mount to the degree that encroaches upon the allowable catch balance.&nbsp; To prosecute these mixed-stock fisheries in a riverine system with eight ESA-listed Columbia River salmon species (or distinct population segments, https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species-directory), a great deal of monitoring and management is involved.&nbsp; The SAFE fisheries must be sampled when catch is delivered to buyers, not only to determine the quantity caught, recorded on fish tickets, but bio-sampling to observe fin clips that indicate specific stocks, such as SABs, and whether snouts contain coded-wire tags (CWT), and scales collected for aging (see protocol 1772: Fish Sampling for the Select Area Fisheries Enhancement (SAFE) Program).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During fisheries sampling, snouts are scanned for CWTs.&nbsp; If present, they are sent to labs for codes to be deciphered and reported to agencies who link associated data (<em>e.g</em>., stock, date released and by whom, <em>etc</em>.).&nbsp; Data from recovered CWTs are used for four purposes: 1) to validate VSIs by comparing the &ldquo;stock call&rdquo; to the stock linked to the tag code; 2) for cohort reconstruction of SAFE produced salmon, each release having a unique CWT code, that is used to estimate abundance of SAFE-produced CWT release groups, in sequential years from age 2 to the end of the cohort&rsquo;s life span, that are represented in sport and commercial ocean and river landings and escapement of salmon recorded on the spawning grounds and that return to hatcheries; 3) once the cohort&rsquo;s life span has ended and a full cohort reconstruction is completed for each of SAFE Program&rsquo;s CWT release groups, smolt-to-adult survival rates are calculated to examine project effectiveness, and; 4) run reconstruction allocates what stocks contribute to mixed-stock fisheries, in this case Select Area fisheries, and includes SAFE-produced and non-SAFE produced CWT release groups.&nbsp; The SAFE Program uses run reconstruction to show proportions of all stocks caught in in SAFE WSS and fall fisheries, while cohort reconstruction is used to show what fisheries SAFE-produced releases were landed and SAS rates.&nbsp; Stock and age composition of SAFE landings are summarized using data on landings, obtained by fish tickets, CWT recoveries to validate VSI stock calls, and ages assigned by scale analysis, both obtained from sampling fisheries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the WSS fishery, spring Chinook is the focus and impacts to upriver spring Chinook generally limits the fishery.&nbsp; Sturgeon are also allocated for SAFE fishers and landings often include both spring Chinook and sturgeon.&nbsp; SAFE fisheries during fall includes sturgeon, if allocated catch remains, fall Chinook (tules and brights), and coho.&nbsp; In fall, CWTs are relied upon to a greater extent for in-season management of fall Chinook fisheries but VSI protocols are used to distinguish tules from brights.&nbsp; For some stocks, high CWT rates allow for sufficient recoveries of CWTs for management purposes.&nbsp; Since the life-history of coho dictates that they almost always return as age-3 and there are either native, late-returning Lower Columbia River (type N) or hatchery-influenced, early-returning coho (type S).&nbsp; Generally, type S return in September and October and type N return in November and December.&nbsp; Because of the difference in return timing, type N coho can be managed by ending the fishery before the run begins in earnest.&nbsp; Many coho caught in during fall by SAFE fishers have CWTs, which are processed the same as Chinook.</p>\r\n",

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>Rufus Woods Lake is an 82 km long run-of-the-river reservoir on the Columbia River that was formed by the construction of Chief Joseph Dam. &nbsp;Currently, the dam has no fish ladders and blocks upstream fish passage. &nbsp;Grand Coulee Dam forms the upstream end of Rufus Woods Lake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1996, the Colville Tribes, working with Columbia River Fish Farms (an aquaculture facility on Rufus Woods Lake) began a fish release program using Tribal funds to supplement the Rufus Woods Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) fishery.&nbsp; The current Washington State record Rainbow Trout was caught in Rufus Woods Lake in 2002 (29.6 lbs).&nbsp; In 2007 and 2008 there were more than 40,000 angler days spent fishing in Rufus Woods annually, making Rufus Woods the most popular fishing destination on the Colville Reservation.&nbsp; The current Rainbow Trout daily bag limit is two.&nbsp; The reservoir also contains other sport fish including Walleye (<em>Sander vitreus</em>), Kokanee (<em>Oncorhynchus nerka</em>), Burbot (<em>Lota lota</em>), Lake Whitefish (<em>Coregonus clupeaformis</em>), Smallmouth Bass (<em>Micropterus dolomieu</em>), and Brown Trout (<em>Salmo trutta</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previous years&#39; preliminary creel data suggest the trophy fishery and catch rates were maintained at artificially high levels due to excessive fish escapement from the aquaculture net pens located within Rufus Woods Lake and not from the Colville Tribes&#39; fish purchases and stocking efforts (Shallenberger 2009).&nbsp; In early 2014, one of the two aquaculture facilities on Rufus Woods Lake shutdown.&nbsp; The other facility has greatly reduced its fish escapement and excess feed drift.&nbsp; As a result, the few bigger Rainbow Trout released by the Tribes&#39; have been unable to sustain historically high catch rates of trophy fish. &nbsp;Additional studies were conducted to investigate the potential of supplementing the fishery with many smaller Rainbow Trout that could grow within the lake.&nbsp; However, the majority of Rainbow Trout released only occupied Rufus Woods Lake for one month because of harvest, entrainment and other unidentified causes, making growth of smaller fish to trophy size unlikely (Brown et al. 2011).&nbsp; Diet and secondary production studies also indicated insufficient food resources are incorporated into Rainbow Trout diets to produce an adequate trophy fishery (Richards et al. 2011).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For these reasons, the goal of the fishery has shifted from a trophy-only fishery to a combined catchable and trophy fishery. To achieve this goal, the release consist of approximately 67% large catchable Rainbow Trout (~0.45 kg per fish, &gt;400 mm total length) to maintain higher catch rates of quality size fish, and approximately 33% larger fish (~15,000 trout at ~&gt;1.5 kg per fish) to provide the opportunity to catch memorable-trophy size Rainbow Trout (size categories based on Brouder et al. 2009).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to provide information on the fishery for optimal management, the Colville Tribes has conducted a detailed creel study since 2007.&nbsp; These protocols have been changed overtime to reflect changes in the fishery (usage and site access locations), project budget, and personnel constraints.</p>\r\n",

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>Under the Northwest Power Planning Act, the Bonneville Power Administration was mandated to mitigate for wildlife habitat losses. In order to do that BPA must be able to measure the amount and quality of habitat lost and gained through their activities, including the Precious Lands project. The accounting system adopted by BPA is a habitat modeling strategy known as a Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP) developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This procedure uses models to measure the quality of a specific habitat for target wildlife species. The models are based on key habitat parameters (ex. shrub height, snag density, or distance to water) and provide a measure of the habitat quality for that particular species. One product of HEP is a quantitative evaluation of habitat quality that is provided in terms of a Habitat Unit (HU). One acre of optimum habitat equals one HU. This HU accounting system is used to determine the amount of credit BPA receives for the land being protected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While HSI models were initially used to evaluate the baseline condition of the Precious Lands Area, long-term monitoring will be conducted based on HEP data collection procedures, but not limited to particular wildlife variables. For example, percent microbiotic crust cover and percent bare ground are recorded for microplots in grasslands while the number of woody debris &gt;4&quot; diameter is recorded for transects in riparian and conifer cover types. Surveys will be used to assess long-term trends in plant community health, weedy encroachment, limiting factors for wildlife and identify/monitor areas of habitat degradation.</p>\r\n",

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>The Lake Roosevelt Habitat Improvement Project (LRHIP) was initiated in 1990 to increase the survival of migratory (adfluvial) rainbow trout <em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em> and ultimately improve Tribal subsistence and recreational harvest opportunity in streams on the Colville Confederated Tribes&rsquo; (CCT) reservation (LeCaire and Peone 1991). The goal was to restore healthy and harvestable salmonid populations through rehabilitation of stream habitat and restoration of ecological function in the riparian corridors of streams. Numerous restoration actions were implemented and corresponding rainbow trout status and trend monitoring was conducted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, as part of the Northwest Power and Conservation Committee&rsquo;s Categorical Review process, there was an evaluation of project accomplishments and future direction. While it was obvious that the project made substantial attempts to improve habitat conditions and monitor trends in rainbow trout populations, it is was also apparent that the approach to both aspects was relatively haphazard. Monitoring study design lacked statistical rigor and prioritization of habitat restoration actions was unclear. In response to these shortcomings, we developed a new approach to habitat restoration and protection that focuses on restoring natural stream function and has a clearly defined prioritization strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will use empirical observations of habitat conditions and current fish use from our monitoring efforts and an Ecosystem Diagnosis and Treatment (EDT) model to help us evaluate where the highest priority areas are for habitat restoration and protection. EDT is an analytical model relating habitat features and biological performance to support conservation and recovery planning for salmonids (Lichatowich et al. 1995; Lestelle et al. 1996; Mobrand et al. 1997; Mobrand et al. 1998). It acts as an analytical framework that brings together information from empirical observation, local experts, and other models and analysis to determine which reaches and habitat attributes are likely to have the most benefit for improving fish performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Development of the EDT model requires the rating of Level II attributes for the current conditions. We place the highest confidence in Level II attribute ratings that are based on empirical data. Many of the Level II attributes are related to physical habitat and flow; however, there are also fish, macroinvertebrate, and water chemistry attributes. Benthic macroinvertebrate community data is limited for most reservation streams without anadromous fish, particularly in smaller streams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While status and trends monitoring is not currently an LRHIP objective, we wanted to collect baseline information on the benthic macroinvertebrate communities in a manner that would allow for future monitoring. With the future monitoring option in mind, we developed our protocol so that it was consistent with other monitoring programs in the Basin, such as the Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program (CHaMP) (Bouwes et al. 2011) and the Integrated Status and Effectiveness Monitoring Program (ISEMP) (Terraqua Inc. 2009).</p>\r\n",

In response to these shortcomings, we developed a new approach to habitat restoration and protection that focuses on restoring natural stream function and has a clearly defined prioritization strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will use empirical observations of habitat conditions and current fish use from our monitoring efforts and an Ecosystem Diagnosis and Treatment (EDT) model to help us evaluate where the highest priority areas are for habitat restoration and protection. EDT is an analytical model relating habitat features and biological performance to support conservation and recovery planning for salmonids (Lichatowich et al. 1995; Lestelle et al. 1996; Mobrand et al. 1997; Mobrand et al. 1998).

We place the highest confidence in Level II attribute ratings that are based on empirical data.

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>&nbsp;Egg-to-fry survival is one of the major factors thought to limit freshwater production and recovery of Chinook salmon <em>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha </em>and other salmon populations (Reiser and White 1988; Peterson and Quinn 1996; DeVries 1997). Despite being critical data that is needed to assist with efforts to recover threatened and endangered salmonid populations, adequate estimates of egg-to-fry survival for Chinook salmon do not currently exist (Healey 1991; Bradford 1995).&nbsp;This lack of information is likely due to the difficulty in measuring Chinook salmon and other salmonid egg-to-fry survival in the field because they deposit their eggs in the gravel during periods that make extensive field research difficult (Quinn 2005). This is particularly true for Chinook salmon, which spawn in large rivers with deeper and swifter water than most other salmon, and for which developing embryos remain in the gravel throughout the winter and early spring when it is difficult to sample (Quinn 2005). Therefore, many of the existing studies of Chinook salmon egg-to-fry survival have occurred in a laboratory setting (Jensen et al. 2009) and may not adequately represent egg-to-fry survival in the natural environment. This work provides estimates of survival and development, and an assessment of factor potentially affecting either metric, over large temporal and spatial scales, in the natural environment. See Johnson et al (2012) for a complete explanation of the methodology associated with this protocol</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "qualityControlConsiderations": "Previous work has suggested that normal error rates associated with data collection and entry do not sizably affect estimates common in the field of fisheries, but that some degree of standardized review is necessary to identify instances of egregious error (Johnson et al. 2009). Efforts are made to ensure a consistent level of data quality through a combination of redundancy in field measures and data entry protocol. Field data (e.g. triangulation measures, redd morphology, distance to the nearest natural redd, site accessibility), are monitored through repeated site visits prior to box recovery. Raw data sheets are then stored in a specified cabinet within the Ellensburg WDFW field office until they can be entered into electronic format. Because data entry is often completed by personnel with varying experience, the vast majority is entered twice, and subjected to a formal cross check by an experienced technician or project biologist. This crosscheck may be in the form of a Read Aloud check, or an Excel based spreadsheet comparison.

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>The Colville Confederated Tribes (CCT) Resident Fish RM&amp;E project is a Columbia River Fish Accord project that began in 2008. The primary goal for the Resident Fish RM&amp;E Project is to conserve, enhance and restore native fish populations in the blocked area above Grand Coulee Dam in Lake Roosevelt and its tributaries, and where appropriate provide opportunities for subsistence harvest by the Colville Tribal members and recreational anglers. The current work of the RM&amp;E project will focus on the protection and conservation of Redband Trout populations on the Colville Confederated Tribes Reservation, with a focus on the Sanpoil River.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>Rainbow trout are a focal species in the Sanpoil Subbasin under the Intermountain Province Subbasin Plan (IMP) due to their recreational value as a sport fish and their cultural significance to the CCT (Gillin and Pizzimenti 2004). The Columbia River Redband&nbsp;Trout are a subspecies of Rainbow TInrout native to the Columbia River drainage east of the Cascade Mountains as far as barrier falls on the Snake, Spokane, Pend Oreille, and Kootenai rivers (Allendorf et al. 1980; Behnke 1992; McLellan and Lee 2010). Effective fisheries management of redband trout requires an understanding of population structure, complex historical management activities, geography, and life history strategies (&nbsp;McCusker et al. 2000; Spidle et al. 2003; Spruell et al. 2003; Small et al. 2006;2007).</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>In 2010, the CCT implemented a Redband&nbsp;Trout stock assessment&nbsp;project in the Sanpoil River (McLellan&nbsp;and Lee 2010). &nbsp;The project plans to implement four primary tasks which include monitoring abundance, monitoring recruitment, monitoring harvest, and monitoring escapement to assist with management decisions. The development of a multi-year data set will enable managers to monitor trends over time and address potential limiting factors. &nbsp;Water temperature monitoring is required to understand limiting factors and movement patterns.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The goal was to restore healthy and&nbsp;harvestable&nbsp;salmonid&nbsp;populations through rehabilitation of stream habitat and restoration of ecological function in the riparian corridors of streams. Numerous restoration actions were implemented and corresponding rainbow trout status and trend monitoring was conducted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, as part of the Northwest Power and Conservation Committee&rsquo;s Categorical Review process, there was an evaluation of project accomplishments and future direction. While it was obvious that the project made substantial attempts to improve habitat conditions and monitor trends in rainbow trout populations, it is was also apparent that the approach to both aspects was relatively haphazard. Monitoring study design lacked statistical rigor and prioritization of habitat restoration actions was unclear. In response to these shortcomings, we developed a new approach to habitat restoration and protection that focuses on restoring natural stream function and has a clearly defined prioritization strategy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will use empirical observations of habitat conditions and current fish use from our monitoring efforts and an Ecosystem Diagnosis and Treatment (EDT) model to help us evaluate where the highest priority areas are for habitat restoration and protection. EDT is an analytical model relating habitat features and biological performance to support conservation and recovery planning for&nbsp;salmonids&nbsp;(Lichatowich&nbsp;et al. 1995;&nbsp;Lestelle&nbsp;et al. 1996;&nbsp;Mobrand&nbsp;et al. 1997;&nbsp;Mobrand&nbsp;et al. 1998). It acts as an analytical framework that brings together information from empirical observation, local experts, and other models and analysis to determine which reaches and habitat attributes are likely to have the most benefit for improving fish performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Development of the EDT model requires the rating of Level II attributes for the current conditions. We place the highest confidence in Level II attribute ratings that are based on empirical data. Work conducted under this protocol will provide reach specific temperature,&nbsp; water, chemistry and stream discharge data to be used to rate EDT Level II attributes associated with each data type.These data will also facilitate analysis of spatial patterns and variance in stream temperature, water chemistry, and discharge among multiple watersheds in the Sanpoil and Upper Columbia River Subbasins</p>\r\n",

The primary goal for the Resident Fish RM&amp;E Project is to conserve, enhance and restore native fish populations in the blocked area above Grand Coulee Dam in Lake Roosevelt and its tributaries, and where appropriate provide opportunities for subsistence harvest by the Colville Tribal members and recreational anglers. The current work of the RM&amp;E project focuses on the protection and conservation of Redband&nbsp;Trout populations on the Colville Confederated Tribes Reservation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rainbow Trout are a focal species in the Sanpoil Subbasin under the Intermountain Province Subbasin Plan (IMP) due to their recreational value as a sport fish and their cultural significance to the CCT (Gillin and Pizzimenti 2004). The Columbia River Redband&nbsp;Trout are a subspecies of rainbow trout native to the Columbia River drainage east of the Cascade Mountains as far as barrier falls on the Snake, Spokane, Pend Oreille, and Kootenai rivers (Allendorf et al. 1980; Behnke 1992; McLellan and Lee 2010). Effective fisheries management of Redband&nbsp;Trout requires an understanding of population structure, complex historical management activities, geography, and life history strategies (McCusker et al. 2000; Spidle et al. 2003; Spruell et al. 2003; Small and Dean 2006; Small et al. 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to properly manage the Redband Trout&nbsp;populations managers require a basic&nbsp;understanding of population dynamics and an understanding of survival in trends during key life-histories. &nbsp;In 2010 the Colville Tribe began working with regional co-managers to develop a comprehensive plan to monitor the Redband&nbsp;Trout populations in the blocked area. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (McLellan and Lee 2010) developed a Redband Trout Stock Assessment Plan that could be used by the co-managers to collect key life history information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the outline the CCT has used to develop the Resident Fish RM&amp;E program to conduct stock assessment study&nbsp;on Redband&nbsp;Trout in the Sanpoil River.

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>The Columbia River&nbsp;Redband&nbsp;Trout&nbsp;<em>Oncorhynchus</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>mykiss</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>gairdneri</em>&nbsp;are a subspecies of Rainbow Trout native to the Columbia River drainage east of the Cascade Mountains. Their known distribution extends upstream as far as barrier falls on the Snake, Spokane, Pend Oreille, and&nbsp;Kootenai&nbsp;rivers (Allendorf&nbsp;et al. 1980;&nbsp;Behnke&nbsp;1992). There is considerable variability in the life history of Columbia River&nbsp;Redband&nbsp;Trout (Redband&nbsp;Trout) including both&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;(<em>O.</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>mykiss</em>&nbsp;that migrate to the ocean) and&nbsp;potamodromous&nbsp;(<em>O.</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>mykiss</em>&nbsp;that migrate solely within fresh water) forms (Behnke&nbsp;1992). Recently,&nbsp;potamodromous&nbsp;Redband&nbsp;Trout were estimated to occur in 42% of their historic range with invasive species habitat degradation and fragmentation, and climate change being the primary threats to their long term survival (Muhlfeld&nbsp;2015). Redband Trout are classified as a sensitive species or species of special concern by several states and federal agencies and the American Fisheries Society Endangered Species Committee (Williams et al. 1989;&nbsp;Muhlfeld&nbsp;et al. 2001).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The construction of Grand Coulee Dam in 1939 eliminated the opportunity for&nbsp;Redband&nbsp;Trout in the Upper Columbia River to express&nbsp;anadromy&nbsp;(Scholz&nbsp;et al. 1985) and likely blocked migration routes and isolated populations and habitats of&nbsp;potamodromous&nbsp;Redband&nbsp;Trout. Lake Roosevelt formed in the impounded portion of the Columbia River behind Grand Coulee Dam and supports important tribal and recreational fisheries.&nbsp;Non-native hatchery Rainbow Trout (McCloud&nbsp;River, California &nbsp;<em>O.</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>stonei</em>) have been stocked in the upper Columbia River and its tributaries to provide angling opportunities and as mitigation for hydropower related impacts (Stober&nbsp;et al. 1977;&nbsp;Peone&nbsp;et al. 1989). Naturally reproducing Rainbow Trout still occur in the upper Columbia River drainage upstream of Grand Coulee Dam.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Potamodromy can be divided into four types: fluvial, fluvial-adfluvial, lacustrine-adfluvial, and allacustrine (Varley and Gresswell 1988; Northcote 1997). Lake Roosevelt and its tributaries support fluvial, fluvial-adfluvial, and lacustrine-adfluvial&nbsp;life history types. All three life history types have also been documented within the&nbsp;Sanpoil&nbsp;River drainage, including a small fall run of&nbsp;lacustrine&nbsp;adfluvial&nbsp;fish (Brown et al. 2013). The Sanpoil is the only documented tributary in Lake Roosevelt supporting fall migrating adult&nbsp;Redband&nbsp;Trout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsatellite&nbsp;DNA analysis conducted on wild-born Rainbow Trout in the upper Columbia River drainage indicated that some stocks were pure&nbsp;Redband&nbsp;Trout (Powell and&nbsp;Faler&nbsp;2002; Taylor 2002; Small and Dean 2006, 2007; Small et al. 2007). Redband Trout persisted in many tributaries with no history of coastal-lineage hatchery Rainbow Trout introductions and where barriers prevented hatchery fish from moving into tributaries (Small et al. 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Redband Trout Stock Assessment Project (RTSAP) was initiated in Lake Roosevelt by the three co-managers in 2010, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW),&nbsp;Colville&nbsp;Confederated Tribes (CCT), and the Spokane Tribe of Indians (STI). One of the objectives of RTSAP study is to develop a basin wide genetic stock inventory of the remnant Redband Trout populations in the Lake Roosevelt watershed. This information will be used by regional fisheries managers to assist with habitat restoration plans, conservation needs, and harvest regulation changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n",

    "backgroundRationale": "<p>The Grande Ronde River Upper Mainstem summer steelhead population (GRUM) area is 4,239 km<sup>2</sup> in size and consists of six MaSAs and seven MiSAs (ICTRT 2010).&nbsp; Steelhead are widely distributed throughout the population area and occupy all six of the MaSAs and five of the seven MiSAs.&nbsp; Steelhead spawners are predominantly natural origin, although from 1999-2002, a portion of spawners were comprised of Wallowa Hatchery stock, which were directly released into Catherine Creek and the upper Grande Ronde River (ICTRT 2010).&nbsp; Although Wallowa stock hatchery fish are still released into portions of the Grande Ronde River subbasin, there have been a significant number of hatchery management changes which have reduced the number of hatchery fish spawning in nature (ICTRT 2010).&nbsp;&nbsp; The ODFW currently manages the GRUM for natural origin steelhead where hatchery influence is considered negligible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Index spawning ground surveys began in 1967, and redd counts from annual index area spawning ground surveys and intrinsic potential of spawning habitat were used to estimate abundance of adult summer steelhead (ICTRT 2010).&nbsp; In 2008, index site surveys were maintained for historical continuity, but the protocol was adjusted, and abundance is now based on a Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) design to achieve a statistically useful dataset (Ruzycki et al. 2008).&nbsp; Data used for calculating age proportion and proportion hatchery origin spawners (pHOS) are collected by the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) at three weirs in the GRUM population area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has an obligation under the Sustainable Fisheries Act to restore depleted populations to optimal levels of abundance and productivity (McElhany et al. 2000).&nbsp; The Viable Salmonid Parameter (VSP) concept can be used to inform management decisions and is used by NOAA to assess the current status of the populations, in terms of extinction risk (ICTRT 2010).&nbsp; The VSP parameters include abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity.&nbsp; Natural origin spawner abundance (NOSA) is a measure of abundance and is assessed annually.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
