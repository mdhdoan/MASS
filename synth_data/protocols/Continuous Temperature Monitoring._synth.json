  "abstract": " In order to effectively monitor and assess changes in water temperature within the Wind River watershed, which is a crucial factor for steelhead spawning, rearing, and migration, continuous temperature monitoring is necessary. This is accomplished by placing thermographs throughout the river system. The University of California, Davis (UCD) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) collaborate to carry out this effort, with UCD supporting the operation and maintenance of 7 thermographs and USGS managing an additional 11 sites. By strategically coordinating the placement of these devices, both agencies ensure comprehensive coverage of the watershed while avoiding redundancy.\n\nThe data collected from continuous temperature monitoring offers valuable insights into daily and seasonal fluctuations. This information is essential for informing and guiding habitat restoration projects. For instance, by analyzing temperature differences across various locations within a river system, researchers can identify areas that require more attention or remediation efforts. In summary, this method of in-stream temperature monitoring enables effective water quality management, promoting the health of steelhead populations and overall watershed sustainability."

  "description": " In the Wind River watershed, temperature is a crucial limiting factor for steelhead spawning, rearing, and migration. To evaluate changes in this parameter, continuous temperature monitoring is indispensable. The University of California, Davis (UCD) will collaborate with partnering agencies to maintain this ongoing temperature surveillance. UCD employs its standard operating procedures and water quality database to perform these tasks. UCD supports the operation and upkeep of seven thermographs within the Wind River watershed. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) manages an additional eleven sites, and both agencies collaborate on the placement of thermographs to capture the most comprehensive representation of watershed conditions without redundancy.\n\nThe data acquired from this temperature monitoring initiative is vital for informing and guiding habitat restoration projects. Continuous in-stream temperature measurements enable the analysis of daily and seasonal fluctuations, which can provide valuable insights into spatial variations. By deploying thermographs throughout the river system, it becomes possible to perform a spatial assessment of temperature differences within that system. This approach permits a more comprehensive understanding of the temperature conditions across various locations within the watershed."
