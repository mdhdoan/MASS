  "abstractText": "The objective of this study is to determine the abundance, trends, and consumptive impacts of non-native fishes upstream of McNary Dam in the mainstem Columbia River. Under an adaptive management approach, predator population abundance and growth rates will be monitored and used to evaluate the effectiveness of current (e.g., deregulating harvest) and future management actions designed to increase juvenile salmon survival, with the ability to identify significant changes in predator population status over time and space.Boat electrofishing is the only methodology to capture many fish of all species with little harm to the fish if settings are optimizd.",
