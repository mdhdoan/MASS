  "abstractText": "EDT is a deterministic model that characterizes habitat potential for a target species by evaluating the effect of habitat conditions on habitat productivity and capacity benchmarks for that species. EDT benchmarks are the theoretical natural limits on survival and density. These conditions constitute what can be thought of as as good as it gets for survival of the species under ideal natural habitat conditions (Lestelle et al. 2004).The species-habitat relationships are used to adjust the optimal benchmark performance to account for site-specific conditions characterized in the model habitat environment. Benchmarks are life stage-specific and consider fecundity, ideal productivity, typical life stage duration, and maximum density (or capacity). The species-habitat relationship rules are a set of life stage-specific sensitivity curves for each environmental attribute in the model. The sensitivity curves adjust, or degrade, the theoretical benchmarks downward to reflect local conditions because conditions in any stream are inherently constrained by local geology, climate and biology independent of anthropogenic constraints. As a result, fish performance is typically less than the benchmark optimal levels even in the pristine environment.The sensitivity curves provide a systematic means for quantifying survival conditions for any reach by computing performance in the local environment relative to the benchmarks. This procedure ensures that productivity and capacity values computed for each life history segment are: a) bounded by the biological limits of the species, b) scaled consistently across time, space, and life stage, and c) scaled consistently with the benchmark values (Lestelle et al. 2004).Typically, EDT model parameterization involves the selection of one of seven existing salmon and steelhead sensitivity curves developed by ICF and others. Those curves are based on recent scientific literature and represent current understanding of the effect of habitat conditions on survival. These sensitivity curves are best thought of as hypotheses about how survival is affected by environmental conditions because scientific understanding is continuously evolving (Lestelle et al. 2004).",
