2. Abstract:
eDNA tests have shown potential as an efficient and temporally sensitive tool for the early detection of invasive species, such as the New Zealand mudsnails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum). Researchers conducted a study in the Portneuf River near Pocatello, Idaho, collecting water filter samples from two field sites. The river is a human-altered, eutrophic water body with high nutrient and sediment loads, making it an ideal environment to test the effectiveness of eDNA methods for detecting invasive species in altered freshwater ecosystems.

3. Description:
The study focuses on eDNA tests as a potential method for early detection of New Zealand mudsnails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in the Portneuf River near Pocatello, Idaho. The researchers collected water filter samples from two field sites to analyze for traces of the invasive species' DNA. The Portneuf River is a 5th-order river with a drainage basin size of 3445 km2 and flows approximately 150 km before merging with the Snake River. It has been altered by human activities, resulting in high nutrient and sediment loads. Previous studies have shown that altered freshwater ecosystems pose unique challenges for detecting invasive species using eDNA methods. This study highlights the importance of understanding how eDNA tests perform under various environmental conditions to effectively detect invasive species and prevent their spread.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to explore the feasibility of eDNA tests as an early detection tool for New Zealand mudsnails in altered freshwater ecosystems.

5. Constraints:
A major constraint for this method is the influence of human-altered environments on eDNA detection. High nutrient and sediment loads, common in altered water bodies, can potentially interfere with eDNA test sensitivity and accuracy, making it challenging to detect trace amounts of invasive species DNA in such ecosystems.
