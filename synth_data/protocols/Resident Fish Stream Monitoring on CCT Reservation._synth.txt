 Sure, I'd be happy to help label the topics and extract key information from the text you provided. Here is my analysis:

1. Abstract:
The text describes a protocol for monitoring the success of fish stocking in Nespelem Creek on the Colville Reservation. The goal is to increase the number of catchable size rainbow trout for angler harvest up to 30 days post-stocking, while preventing any introgression of native stocks. Surveys are conducted 30 and 60 days after stocking to assess the presence/absence of trout and measure catch rates of anglers in stocked waters.
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes:
Values: Protecting native fish stocks, promoting sustainable fishing practices.
Problem Statement: Ensuring the success of fish stocking programs while preventing the negative impacts on native fish populations.
Desired outcomes: Increased efficiency of hatchery programs, improved angler catch rates, preservation of native fish stocks.
3. Description:
The text describes a protocol for monitoring the success of fish stocking programs using stream surveys and voluntary creel boxes to measure the number and species of fish present and estimate overall angler catch rates. The surveys are conducted 30 and 60 days after stocking to determine the presence/absence of trout and measure catch rates. This information is used to prevent any introgression of native stocks and stock in the most efficient manner.
4. Objectives:
Objective: To monitor the success of fish stocking programs and ensure that they are meeting their objectives while minimizing negative impacts on native fish populations.
Summary of Solution Coverage: The text covers the methods used to monitor the success of fish stocking programs, including stream surveys and voluntary creel boxes, as well as the specific timing and goals of these surveys (30 and 60 days after stocking).
Keywords: Fish stocking, monitoring, stream surveys, voluntary creel boxes, native stocks, introgression, hatchery program, angler catch rates.
5. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the protocol is to monitor the success of fish stocking programs and ensure that they are meeting their objectives while minimizing negative impacts on native fish populations.
6. Constraints:
The text does not specify any constraints for the current protocol, but it may include factors such as budget, personnel, equipment, and regulatory requirements.
