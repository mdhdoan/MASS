  "abstractText": "This method describes the use of Cervus software to do genetic parentage analysis. Cervus is a computer program for assignment of parents to their offspring using genetic markers. Cervus uses likelihood, a well-established statistical method for parentage analysis, to assign parentage. Cervus analyses genetic data from co-dominant genetic markers such as microsatellites (STRs), SNPs and allozymes.",
