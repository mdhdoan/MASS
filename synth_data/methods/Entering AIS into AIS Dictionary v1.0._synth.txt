 1. Keywords: AIS Data Dictionary, GPS location, sample reach, centralized information storage
2. Abstract: The AIS Data Dictionary is a crucial tool for organizing and accessing information about Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) in a specific area. By associating AIS data with GPS locations, this method enables comprehensive tracking and management of AIS populations. This centralized approach to data storage facilitates efficient collection, analysis, and sharing of AIS-related details, ultimately supporting effective conservation strategies.
3. Description: The AIS Data Dictionary functions as a repository for storing essential information about each AIS present in a given reach or area. This information is connected with the precise GPS location of the corresponding structure, allowing for comprehensive data collection and management. Having this centralized location for AIS details ensures that additional attributes related to these species can be easily gathered, stored, and accessed as needed.
4. Target: The primary goal of the AIS Data Dictionary is to create a unified platform for storing and managing information about Aquatic Invasive Species within specific geographic areas.
5. Constraints: There are no explicit constraints mentioned in the text body; however, potential limitations could include data accuracy, timely updates, and ensuring adequate security measures for sensitive conservation data.
