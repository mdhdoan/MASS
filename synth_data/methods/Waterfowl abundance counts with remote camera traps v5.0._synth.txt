2. Abstract: This method utilizes camera trap monitoring to collect data on waterfowl abundance at the TD-1 and TD-2 projects over five consecutive years. The goal is to demonstrate the response of migratory waterfowl to habitat manipulation and moist soil management practices, such as water regime manipulation, soil disturbance, vegetation management, and supplemental planting. These practices aim to promote early successional wetlands and provide beneficial habitat for other wetland obligate species. The data collected will help evaluate the success of these projects in increasing waterfowl utilization and improving wetland habitats.
3. Description: Camera trap monitoring has been conducted at the TD-1 project for five years to track waterfowl abundance, with a noted increase in waterfowl use for four consecutive years. This indicates the success of the project's intensive management practices. At the TD-2 project, the primary goal is to create 71 acres of hemi-marsh habitat within 19 isolated wetland basins to encourage waterfowl brood production. However, tall emergent vegetation and sedimentation are currently impacting these wetland basins, making them less desirable for waterfowl. Biologists place elevated camera traps across habitats in the project area, taking photos every hour from sunrise to sunset. Each camera trap covers a measureable surface area of one acre, creating sub-samples of waterfowl density estimates across the project area.
4. Target: The primary focus is to monitor and evaluate the response of waterfowl abundance to habitat manipulation and moist soil management practices at the TD-1 and TD-2 projects.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method include the impact of tall emergent vegetation and sedimentation on wetland basins, which can negatively affect waterfowl utilization. Additionally, the success of this method relies on continuous camera trap monitoring and data collection over several years to accurately assess changes in waterfowl abundance and habitat quality.
