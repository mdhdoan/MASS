2. Abstract: The Department of Fisheries Resources Management (DFRM) Research Division of the Nez Perce Tribe developed a standardized methodology for calculating high-level indicators and metrics for fish populations. This approach aims to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and comparability of data and results across projects and fish populations. The method utilizes four technical teams focusing on data collection, summarization, analysis, and management. By employing a standardized set of techniques and calculations, the DFRM addresses the need for consistent and accurate evaluation of Chinook Salmon and summer steelhead populations.

3. Description: The DFRM Research Division has established four technical teams to develop and standardize analytical methodology and data management for monitoring Chinook Salmon and summer steelhead populations. The Adult Technical Team (ATT) focuses on spawning ground surveys, picket weir operations, and in-stream PIT tag detection systems, analyzing indicators of abundance, life history characteristics, and population productivity. The Juvenile Technical Team (JTT) is responsible for processing data from rotary screw traps, beach seining, underwater snorkeling, and in-hatchery monitoring, discussing abundance, survival, and life history characteristics of various juvenile life stages.

The third technical team consists of Research Division management and project leader staff who focus on the best methods for data analysis and hatchery effectiveness monitoring, implementing adaptive management. The Data Management team handles data acquisition, storage, and processing, creating accurate and efficient tools to assist project staff and fish managers in answering their data-related questions.

Standardized methods and calculations have been chosen collaboratively by Research Division projects and technical teams as the best method for representing all monitored fish populations. However, in some instances, multiple methods were necessary due to existing differences in management strategies or fish population complexity. In these cases, population differences and necessary methods used in each location are clearly identified in annual progress reports.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to establish a standardized, transparent, reproducible, and comparable approach for calculating high-level indicators and metrics for fish populations monitored by the Nez Perce Tribe using standardized techniques and calculations.
5. Constraints: Although the method strives to avoid different methods for indicator and metric calculations, there may be instances where multiple methods are necessary due to existing differences in management strategies or fish population complexity. Additionally, annual progress reports will need to document and detail methodologies used to calculate indicators and metrics that differ from the standard approaches described within this document to accommodate rare annual events and more complex methods.
