  "abstractText": "Fish cover, algae, and aquatic macrophytes are assessed using a semi-quantitative visual estimate of the channel, extending 5 m upstream and downstream of each primary transect. Features that are visually estimated in this area include filamentous algae, aquatic macrophytes, woody debris (>0.3 m diameter), brush and small woody debris (<0.3 m diameter), overhanging vegetation (< 1 m above the water surface), undercut banks, boulders, and artificial structures. Percent cover classes are determined for each class of fish cover.",
