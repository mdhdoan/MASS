2. Abstract:
Coded Wire Tags (CWTs) are a crucial method used in fisheries management for identifying and tracking juvenile salmonids as they grow into adults. By implanting CWTs in juvenile fish, researchers can recover and analyze them when the fish return to their spawning grounds or are caught in fisheries. This information helps estimate various parameters such as ocean and freshwater distribution, fishery contribution, run size forecasting, stray rates, and survival rates. The use of CWTs is essential for understanding the life cycle and behavior of salmonids, which aids in effective conservation and management strategies.

3. Description:
Coded Wire Tags (CWTs) are small tags implanted into juvenile salmonids before they are released into their natural habitats. When recovered from adults in fisheries or escapement areas, these tags provide valuable information on the fish's origin and behavior during its life cycle. The recovery of CWTs can help estimate various parameters such as ocean and freshwater distribution, fishery contribution, run size forecasting, stray rates, and survival rates (SARs). This information is critical for understanding the population dynamics of salmonids, which aids in effective conservation and management strategies.

4. Target:
The primary focus of using CWTs in juvenile salmonids is to track and identify fish populations as they grow into adults, providing essential data on their life cycle and behavior.

5. Constraints:
The use of CWTs has some constraints, including the cost and labor associated with tagging and recovering tags, as well as potential impacts on the survival and behavior of the fish themselves. Additionally, there is a risk that tags may not be detected or recovered, leading to incomplete data.
