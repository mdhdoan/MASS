2. Abstract: This method is derived from an EMAP protocol for monitoring western wadable streams and focuses on determining the extent of channel constraint within the floodplain. Channel constraint, caused by natural or human activities, can significantly impact the habitat quality and quantity for aquatic organisms and influence stream channel adjustments due to alterations in flow and sediment supply or direct manipulations like dredging. The method modifies techniques used by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to assess overall reach channel constraint, providing a comprehensive approach to evaluate and manage wadable streams.
3. Description: The method is based on an EMAP protocol for monitoring western wadable streams and includes detailed instructions for evaluating channel constraint within the floodplain. Channel constraint results from non-erodible river margins, which can be natural or human-induced, limiting the stream's ability to form its own channels through scour and deposition. The degree of channel constraint has a strong influence on aquatic organism habitat, as well as stream channel adjustments in response to anthropogenic alterations in flow and sediment supply or direct manipulations like dredging, revetments, or impoundment. To assess overall reach channel constraint, the method adapts techniques used by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in their Aquatic Inventories (Moore et al., 1993).
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to evaluate and manage the impact of channel constraint on wadable streams within western regions, taking into account both natural and human-induced factors.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include potential limitations in data availability or accuracy regarding river margins and human activities affecting the stream channels. Additionally, resource constraints may limit the ability to conduct thorough assessments or implement recommended management practices.
