2. Abstract: This method outlines the process of monitoring woody riparian revegetation in a small, incised stream system located in a semi-arid region of the Pacific Northwest. The necessity for this method arises from the common problem of stream channel incision in such regions, which often results in the loss of riparian vegetation. Riparian vegetation plays a crucial role in altering processes such as sedimentation and erosion, providing important habitat for fish and wildlife, and enhancing adjacent habitats. Therefore, monitoring the impacts of herbivory, different herbivory protection structures, spatial location, and plant species on growth and survivorship of tree stakes planted in riparian areas is essential for assessing project actions and outcomes, improving future practices, and ensuring the successful restoration of degraded streams.

3. Description: The method focuses on monitoring woody riparian revegetation using tree stakes planted in riparian areas of a small, incised stream system in a semi-arid region of the Pacific Northwest. The locations of these stakes are assumed to have been recorded at the time of initial planting, and each tree is labeled with an identifying tag. Annual monitoring in the spring is conducted to assess the impacts of various factors on growth and survivorship. These factors include herbivory, different herbivory protection structures, spatial location, and plant species. The data collection process utilizes a database on a tablet device or paper datasheets for a small restoration project. This method serves as a follow-up monitoring of an initial restoration design.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to monitor the impacts of various factors on the growth and survivorship of tree stakes planted in riparian areas as part of a river and stream restoration project.

5. Constraints: This method assumes that the locations of riparian tree stakes were recorded at the time of initial planting, and that trees were labeled with an identifying tag. Additionally, this method requires annual monitoring in the spring and the use of a database on a tablet device or paper datasheets for data collection.
