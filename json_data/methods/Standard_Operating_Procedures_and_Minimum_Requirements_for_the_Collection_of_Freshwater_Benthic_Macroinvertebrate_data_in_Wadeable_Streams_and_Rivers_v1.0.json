  "abstractText": "This document is the Environmental Assessment Program (EAP) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the collection of freshwater benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) data in wadeable streams and rivers. It provides minimum requirements for the standardized methods of collecting and preserving aquatic insects, as well as for the taxonomic identification and reporting of the contents of BMI samples.The methods described here are compatible with those used by other federal and state agencies in the Pacific Northwest Region (Hayslip 2007). Data collected using these methods allows us to share data with other agencies, thereby allowing for more efficient use of time in the field and potentially more extensive sampling of the wadeable streams in Washington.The procedures outlined here are used by Environmental Assessment Program staff when collecting macroinvertebrates from wadeable rivers and streams in Washington State. In addition, to allow for comparable results, any data submitted for analysis using Ecologys bioassessment models by outside entities should be conducted in this manner.",
