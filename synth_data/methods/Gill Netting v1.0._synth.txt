2. Abstract:
Variable mesh gill nets are a useful method for sampling fish populations when mortality is not a limiting factor. Gill nets are designed to capture fish by the gills, leading to high mortality rates. However, careful net tending can help reduce the number of casualties. This non-selective fishing method is effective in capturing various fish sizes and species, allowing researchers to gather valuable data on population abundance, stock characteristics, distribution, and richness. Despite their advantages, gill nets may also unintentionally trap non-target aquatic animals and birds. Researchers can use this method to determine relative abundance, total abundance, and species composition in lakes or streams by measuring CPUE and recapture rates of marked fish. Additional insights into the use of gill nets are available in various studies such as Bernabo (1986), Bakwill and Combs (1994), Bonar et al. (2000), Klemm et al. (1993) and Hubert (1996).

3. Description:
Gill nets are appropriate for sampling fish when mortality is not a concern, as their design results in high fish mortality due to the trapping mechanism around the gills. Although careful net tending can minimize mortality rates, it cannot be completely avoided. By employing variable mesh panels, these nets enable the capture of different-sized fish, making them ideal for collecting data on population abundance, stock characteristics (e.g., length, sex, genotypes), distribution, and species richness. However, gill nets are not species-selective, resulting in more non-target species caught than target ones. Moreover, small aquatic mammals and birds can accidentally get entangled and drown in the mesh.

To utilize gill nets effectively, researchers can achieve various objectives:
- Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring CPUE.
- Estimate total abundance of lake populations using marked fish recapture rates.
- Collect fish samples to study their length, sex, genotypes, and phenotypes.
- Assess species composition and the relative biomass in a lake or stream.

These methods are grounded in studies such as Bernabo (1986), Bakwill and Combs (1994), Bonar et al. (2000), Klemm et al. (1993) and Hubert (1996).

4. Target:
The primary goal of using variable mesh gill nets is to gather information about fish populations in terms of their abundance, stock characteristics, distribution, and species richness while acknowledging constraints such as incidental capture and mortality of non-target species.

5. Constraints:
The use of gill nets comes with certain limitations, including high fish mortality rates, potential capture and drowning of non-target aquatic mammals and birds, and lack of species selectivity in captures. These constraints need to be addressed when implementing this sampling method.
