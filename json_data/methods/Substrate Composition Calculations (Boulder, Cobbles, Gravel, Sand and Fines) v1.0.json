Estimates are rounded to the nearest 5% for a total of 100%; 1% denotes minimal presence.Metrics are calculated at the site level for:Percent Boulders and CobblesPercent BouldersPercent CobblesPercent Coarse and Fine GravelPercent Sand and FinesThe CHaMP - Ocular Channel Unit Substrate Composition Method provides background on identification of the channel units that are analyzed for this calculation.
