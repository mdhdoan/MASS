  "abstractText": "Upon arrival at a stream site, first confirm you are at the correct site. Then determine if the stream meets certain criteria for sampling and data collection activities to occur.  Decide whether the stream is unduly influenced by rain events which could affect the representativeness of field data and samples. Certain conditions at the time of the visit may warrant the collection of only a subset of field measurements and samples. Finally, if it is determined that the stream is to be sampled, lay out a defined reach of the stream within which all subsequent sampling and measurement activities are conducted.",
