  "abstractText": "Brunelli and Thorgaard (2008) developed new Y-chromosome specific markers for Chinook salmon (OtY3) and rainbow trout (OmyY1), which are readily detected by PCR assays and are advantageous because they also produce autosomal control amplification products.  We have made modifications to their protocols to allow this sex specific region to be examined using other genetic platforms.  We describe protocols used in our lab to run sex markers for Chinook salmon and steelhead, but acknowledge that there may be other protocols and procedures available for interrogating this Y-chromosome region.",
