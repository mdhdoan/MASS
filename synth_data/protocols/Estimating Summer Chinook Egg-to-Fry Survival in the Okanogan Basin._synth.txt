 1. Abstract: This text outlines a study on Chinook salmon egg-to-fry survival and development, addressing the lack of adequate estimates in natural environments. The study aims to investigate environmental factors' impact and provide estimates of survival and development at large scales in the natural environment.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: 
   - Values: Understanding and preserving freshwater production and recovery of Chinook salmon and other salmon populations.
   - Problem Statement: The absence of accurate egg-to-fry survival estimates for Chinook salmon due to difficulties in field research and laboratory setting limitations.
   - Desired Outcomes: Estimates of survival, development, and influencing factors, as well as controlling parental effects, across spatial and temporal scales in natural environments.
3. Description: This text details a study focusing on Chinook salmon egg-to-fry survival and development estimates in natural environments. The researchers will examine environmental factors' influence on survival and development, estimate recovery stages, and control for parental effects. The methodology includes selecting spatially and temporally representative locations, comparing in-lab to natural conditions, and using a thermal sums model for deployment duration.
4. Objectives: 
   - Objective: Investigate environmental factors' influence on Chinook salmon egg-to-fry survival and development in the target watershed.
   - Summary of Solution Coverage: The objective covers the main problem statement by addressing critical environmental factors that impact survival and development, providing estimates at various stages and locations.
   - Keywords: Chinook salmon, egg-to-fry survival, development, environmental factors, spatial and temporal scales, parental effects, thermal sums model.
5. Target: The primary focus is to provide accurate estimates of Chinook salmon egg-to-fry survival and development in natural environments while examining the impact of key environmental factors.
6. Constraints: The study's constraints include limited field research accessibility during spawning periods, potential differences between laboratory and natural conditions, and the need to control for parental effects in estimations.
