2. Abstract: This method outlines a standardized approach for quantifying wood in a channel based on the amount of Large Woody Debris (LWD). The technique involves counting and measuring LWD pieces that fall within specific diameter and length parameters and are located within bankfull width and height. The index levels used to determine wood numbers and volumes are derived from previous studies, and ranges for these values depend on LWD density and the presence of jams in larger channels.

3. Description: This method establishes a systematic process for determining wood in a channel through the use of Large Woody Debris (LWD). LWD is defined as pieces with a diameter greater than 0.1 m and a length greater than 2 m. The counting of LWD includes any part of the piece that falls within bankfull width and height, which are not specifically defined in the text but typically refer to the maximum extent of water flow during floods. The index levels for wood numbers and volumes are based on prior research by Peterson et al. (1992), May et al. (1997), Hyatt and Naiman (2001), and Collins et al. (2002). Ranges for index values depend on the density of LWD pieces per channel width and the presence of jams, which are defined as accumulations of five or more LWD pieces in larger channels (>45 m).

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to establish a standardized approach for quantifying wood in a channel based on LWD density and jam presence.

5. Constraints: This method assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of geomorphic and ecological terms, such as bankfull width and Large Woody Debris. Additionally, it relies on previous research to determine index levels for wood numbers and volumes, which may not be universally applicable. The ranges for index values are also based on LWD pieces per channel width and jam presence, which may vary depending on the specific characteristics of a channel.
