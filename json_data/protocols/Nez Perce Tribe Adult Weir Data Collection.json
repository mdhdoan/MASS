  "background": "The Nez Perce Tribe's Department of Fisheries Resources Management utilizes in-stream adult picket weirsas a tool forcapturing, marking, and collecting biological data on returning adult runs of anadromous salmon and steelhead (e.g., Chinook and Coho salmon). Weirs also enable the implementation of management sliding scales. Collected data are utilized in estimating abundance, survival and life history characteristics, and evaluating hatchery effectiveness and population status and trends. Population status and trend monitoring of natural and hatchery origin fish is critical to effective population management, assessing effectiveness of conservation actions and population viability, and evaluating recovery metrics.Please see protocols #2246 and #2249 for data analysis methods describing the calculation of metrics and indicators.",
