  "abstractText": "This document is the Environmental Assessment Program (EAP) Water Quality Studies Unit Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for manually obtaining representative samples from surface waters. This SOP covers the use of secondary collection devices from boats and bridges, but it does not describe the operation of unattended automated sampling devices, pelagic marine sampling or groundwater sampling. The SOPs for the EAP long-term freshwater and marine sampling programs have many similar elements in their procedures.This SOP should be followed for all manual collection of water samples for surface water studies. It includes procedures for collecting samples from freshwater or brackish water lotic and lentic waters (defined in Section 3.0), from wastewater treatment plant access points, and from outfalls, pipes and drains. It also describes procedures for sampling while wading on beaches and from boats and bridges.",
