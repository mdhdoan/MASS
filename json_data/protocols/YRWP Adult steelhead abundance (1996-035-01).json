  "background": "Steelhead redd counts are used as an index of adult spawner abundance on the spawning grounds in Lower Yakima River tributaries (Satus, Toppenish and Ahtanum Creeks) . Redd count surveys have been conducted in Satus creek since the early 1980s, in Toppenish Creek since 1997, and in Ahtanum Creek since 2000. Redd counts are also used to identify spawning habitat and to monitor changes in redd distribution over time. The GPS locations of redds are used in stream reach assessments and the design of stream habitat restoration projects.",
