2. Abstract: Hook-and-line sampling, or angling, is a crucial method for collecting fish when other techniques are not feasible due to Endangered Species Act (ESA) constraints, gear bias, and habitat limitations. This approach allows researchers to target specific species and minimize bycatch, making it particularly effective for various study objectives. The success of this method relies on angler skill and fish behavior, which can make standardization challenging. Collected fish can provide valuable information about diet, size, weight, age, and habitat use, as well as be utilized in tagging studies.

3. Description: Hook-and-line sampling, or angling, is a fishing method used to collect fish when other techniques are not viable due to ESA constraints, gear bias, or habitat limitations. This approach enables researchers to target specific species and minimize bycatch, which helps reduce the capture of non-target species. Angling requires moderate knowledge of angling techniques, with the specifics tailored for different species and study objectives. The method's success depends on angler skill and fish behavior, making it difficult to standardize sampling efforts. Nevertheless, collected fish can offer valuable information about diet, size, weight, age, and habitat use. Additionally, they can be used in tagging studies, which can help researchers track fish movement, growth, and survival rates.

4. Target: The primary focus of hook-and-line sampling is to collect fish for research purposes while minimizing bycatch and addressing ESA constraints, gear bias, and habitat limitations.

5. Constraints: Hook-and-line sampling has some constraints that can impact its effectiveness. These include the dependency on angler skill and fish behavior, which makes standardization challenging. Furthermore, the area sampled is not always well-defined, making it difficult to estimate sample size accurately. However, with proper planning and customization for specific species and study objectives, these constraints can be mitigated.
