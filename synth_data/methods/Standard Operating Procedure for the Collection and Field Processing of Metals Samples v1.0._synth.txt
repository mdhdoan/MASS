2. Abstract: The Environmental Assessment Program (EAP) has developed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for collecting freshwater metals samples to be analyzed by various EPA methods. This SOP aims to ensure the accurate and consistent collection of freshwater metals samples, following the guidelines set out in Method 1669. The methods used for analysis include Dissolved Metals Method 200.8, Total Recoverable Metals Methods 202.2 and a modified version of 200.7, and Total Mercury Methods 245.7 and 245.1. These methods enable the detection and measurement of different forms of metals in freshwater, providing valuable data for environmental monitoring and assessment.

3. Description: The SOP focuses on the collection of freshwater metals samples for laboratory analysis, with sample collection and field processing methods based on Method 1669 from the EPA. The document outlines four specific analytical methods used to analyze the collected samples: Dissolved Metals Method 200.8 (using inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry), Total Recoverable Metals Methods 202.2 and a modified version of 200.7, and Total Mercury Methods 245.7 and 245.1. These methods allow for the detection and measurement of various forms of metals in freshwater samples, providing crucial data for environmental monitoring and assessment programs.

4. Target: The primary focus of this SOP is to establish a standardized procedure for collecting freshwater metals samples for laboratory analysis using EPA-approved methods.

5. Constraints: This SOP has several constraints, including the need for specialized equipment, such as inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry and cold vapor absorbance devices, as well as trained personnel to perform the sample collection and analysis. Additionally, the SOP may be limited by factors such as weather conditions and water quality, which can impact sample collection and accuracy of results.
