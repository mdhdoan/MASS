  "abstractText": "Pacific larval lamprey live in nearshore river sediments for several years burrowedin sediments, where they are filter feeders on detritus and organic matter. They are rarely found outsideof the sediment and their most characteristic behavioural pattern isthe burrowing response.Burrowing behaviour and performance of larval lamprey is important to add to the existing knowledge of habitat selection by providing information about the physical suitability of different substrate types(Quintella et al. 2007) and the avoidance of potentially contaminated substrate (Urein et al. 2013).Burrowing performance can also indicate condition of larval lamprey. Behaviour of fish that are slow to burrow or do not burrow may indicate poor health, stress or injury.",
