  "description": "<p>CHaMP&nbsp;is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010).&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;salmonids&nbsp;and/or their habitat. The implementation of&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;56.3,&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;57, and&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;3.&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel (see section 1.6), at least 9 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The target populations are the Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;Chinook, Catherine Creek Chinook, and Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;Steelhead.&nbsp; Three study designs were generated to meet the sampling needs of each population.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2011 Design Notes:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ChaMP&rsquo;s&nbsp; Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;habitat monitoring program covers three distinct spatial domains, coordinating&nbsp;CHaMP,&nbsp;ODFW, and&nbsp;CRITFC&nbsp;habitat monitoring goals and interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;CRITFC&nbsp;coordinated the sampling for the Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&rsquo;s&nbsp;and Catherine Creek Chinook spawning and rearing habitat. The sampling domain for&nbsp;ODFW&nbsp; (also&nbsp;CHaMP) covers the steelhead spawning and rearing domain, part of which overlaps the Chinook spawning area in both Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;and Catherine Creek.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2011 Design summary</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Survey designs were created for each of the three major domains: Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;and Catherine Creek&nbsp;chinook&nbsp;spawning and rearing domains and steelhead alone domain (i.e., the portion of the Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;steelhead domain that did not overlap with the Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;and Catherine Creek domains).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Design Strata:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;Steelhead Domain: Valley Class (Source/Transport/Depositional) + Ownership (public/private)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legacy sites:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steelhead only domain:</strong>&nbsp;The target steelhead only domain was extended to cover&nbsp;1-6th&nbsp;order&nbsp;wadeable, perennial streams.&nbsp; The standard&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;rotating panel design was adopted (15 annual sites, 10 rotating panel sites on a three year cycle).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Detailed Design Notes File: CRITFC.ODFW design goals.docx contains the discussion about developing both 2011 and 2012 designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2012 Design Notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;ODFW&nbsp;has conducted steelhead spawning surveys; beginning in 2008, using a&nbsp;GRTS&nbsp;based rotating panel structure.&nbsp; This survey was not incorporated into the 2011&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;design.&nbsp;&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;modified the selection of rotating panel 2 and 3 to incorporate legacy steelhead spawning sites.&nbsp; Details of the integration of the steelhead surveys into&nbsp;CHaMP&rsquo;s&nbsp;design are covered in the site selection section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steelhead only domain:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate site lists were generated using Generalized Random&nbsp;Tesselation&nbsp;Stratification (GRTS) for two surveys in the Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;River (UGRR)&nbsp;subbasin: steelhead spawning ground surveys (ST&nbsp;SGS) in 2008 and the Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program (CHaMP) in 2011.&nbsp; Both surveys are conducted by Oregon Dept. of Fish &amp; Wildlife (ODFW) staff in&nbsp;LaGrande, OR.&nbsp;&nbsp;ODFW&nbsp;staff decided that sites from both studies should be melded into one sample set to maximize the number of locations with both ST&nbsp;SGS&nbsp;and&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;data. Ultimately the goal is to compare habitat conditions with steelhead use, both as adults and juveniles (another&nbsp;ODFW&nbsp;study currently underway).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ST&nbsp;SGS&nbsp;sites were broken into three panels designed to be used on a three year rotation.&nbsp; However, they were not stratified. Instead, they were given a use order during the initial&nbsp;GRTS&nbsp;draw in 2008, and sites were chosen in that order based on landowner permissions and other logistic constraints.&nbsp; A total of 30 sites per year were visited: 10 annual sites (selected from the first panel), 10 rotating panel sites (3 year rotation), and 10 &ldquo;new&rdquo; sites which were visited only once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHaMP&rsquo;s&nbsp;rotating panel 2 and 3 designs were changed by incorporating the legacy ST&nbsp;SGS&nbsp;sites.&nbsp; A total of 20 ST&nbsp;SGS&nbsp;sites were transferred to&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;panels 2 and 3 to achieve the original &lsquo;block&rsquo; (valley class by public/private) sample sizes as feasible.&nbsp; ST&nbsp;SGS&nbsp;annual sites were preferred over ST&nbsp;SGS&nbsp;panel sites for movement to&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;(because they have more fish data), and the supply of ST&nbsp;SGS&nbsp;annual sites was exhausted before the panel sites were chosen for&nbsp;CHaMP.&nbsp; ST&nbsp;SGS&nbsp;sites were chosen randomly if more sites than needed fell into a block.&nbsp; Those not randomly selected were designated as&nbsp;oversamples&nbsp;and randomly assigned a use order.&nbsp; A detailed description of the integration of the&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;and ST&nbsp;SGS</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Design file</strong>:&nbsp;ODFW&nbsp;Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;steelhead spawning&nbsp; with CHaMP.docx.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2013 Design Updates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were minimal changes to the Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;design in 2013. &nbsp;Minor changes included the addition of a stratum to add 3 sites for sampling by the Confederated Tribes of the&nbsp;Umatilla&nbsp;Indian Reservation (CTUIR) and a shift of site&nbsp;CBW-360346&nbsp;to the annual panel to also facilitate sampling by&nbsp;CTUIR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2014 Design updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were no design updates to the the study objectives, target frame, or site selection in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2015 Design updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All core&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;designs were updated to accommodate effort that will go towards the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://isemp.egnyte.com/dl/EcV8YyGyV5\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">10% repeat design for&nbsp;CHaMP</a>. &nbsp; The design update will result in 3 annual sites from the active design (e.g. 2014) and move one to each rotating panel. &nbsp;This will result in a net freeing of 2 visits each year that can be used to revisit 2 sites. &nbsp;This change preserves the annual sites within the design and adjusts the frequency of sampling. &nbsp;2 sites slated for sampling in the current year (e.g. 2015) will be randomly selected for repeat sampling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Steelhead domain:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-240730 will move to RP3 (Depositional-Private)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ORW03446-125832 will move to Rotating Panel 1 (Depositional Public)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-382778 will move to Rotating Panel 2(Source Public)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6/27/15: &nbsp;Block counts updated to reflect above. &nbsp;Note that 26 sites will remain in ODFW-Grande Ronde&#39;s design unless altered by Chris Horn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2016 design updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no updates to this design in 2016 (4/19/16)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Design Documentation Files:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;No new design files&nbsp;were generated for 2013--changes to accommodate&nbsp;CTUIR&nbsp;sampling were made directly in&nbsp;champmonitoring.org design documentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2012 redesign files:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://isemp.egnyte.com/h-s/20140130/cb95af9246ff4a4d\">GrandeRondeDesignDocs2012.zip&nbsp;</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n",
