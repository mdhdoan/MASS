2. Abstract: Spawning ground and carcass surveys require the use of various electronic equipment, including Global Positioning System (GPS) units. Familiarity with the operation and maintenance of this equipment is essential for surveyors to ensure proper functionality. The use of a GPS unit during these surveys helps in accurately determining and recording geographic locations, which is crucial for data analysis and interpretation.

3. Description: The text focuses on providing instructions for using a GPS unit during spawning ground and carcass surveys. It emphasizes the importance of surveyors being knowledgeable about the operation of this equipment and ensuring that adequate maintenance and care are taken to maintain proper functionality. A detailed description of a GPS unit's functions, such as marking waypoints, recording tracks, and navigating to specific locations, is provided in the text.

4. Target: The primary focus of the method described is to ensure accurate and efficient use of GPS units during spawning ground and carcass surveys.

5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include ensuring that surveyors are properly trained on the use and maintenance of GPS units, that the equipment is kept in good working order, and that batteries are charged or replaced as needed. Additionally, the accuracy and reliability of the GPS signals can be affected by environmental factors such as weather conditions and terrain.
