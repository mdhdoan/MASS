  "abstractText": "There are a variety of measures that can be calculated to assess the informativeness of genetic markers for population structure inference and parentage.  A common, simple statistic that can be calculated for parentage power is minor allele frequency.  Minor allele frequency (MAF) is simply the frequency at which the less common allele occurs in a given population.  While a locus is most informative for parentage analyses when its alleles are equifrequent (MAF = 0.5), Anderson et al (2006) demonstrated through simulations that 60  100 SNPs with a average MAF of 0.2  may allow accurate pedigree reconstruction, even in situations involving thousands of potential mothers, fathers, and offspring.A useful statistic for measuring the informativeness of a genetic marker for individual ancestry and population structure inference is the measure of informativeness for assignment (In) (Rosenberg et al 2003). For a given set of populations, the minimal In (0) occurs when all alleles have equal frequencies in all populations. The maximal value of In (natural logarithm of the number of populations) occurs when no allele is found in more than one population.  Liu et al (2005), found that on average, the informativeness of random microsatellites is four to twelve times that of random SNPs for various population comparisons, but that SNPs constitute the majority among the most informative markers and the use of these SNPs leads to better inference of population structure than the use of microsatellites. A description of these statistics can be found in Informativeness of genetic markers for inference of ancestry American Journal of Human Genetics 73: 1402-1422 (2003), with extensions in Algorithms for selecting informative marker panels for population assignment Journal of Computational Biology 12: 1183-1201 (2005). http://www.stanford.edu/group/rosenberglab/infocalc.html.",
