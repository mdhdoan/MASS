2. Abstract: This method describes a sampling protocol specifically designed for streams where beaver activity is present. It addresses the need to modify traditional site setup and sampling methods in order to accurately assess ecological health indicators like macroinvertebrate populations and large wood accumulation. The adapted protocol ensures comprehensive monitoring of these factors, despite unique challenges posed by beaver dams and modified water flow patterns.
3. Description: The provided text outlines a detailed sampling protocol for streams where beavers are active. Due to the impact of beaver dams on water flow and sedimentation, standard site setup and data collection methods must be modified. This includes adjusting cross-sections to account for altered hydrologic conditions, quantifying large wood accumulation as an indicator of habitat structure, and monitoring macroinvertebrate populations in pool tailfines as a measure of ecological health. Additionally, detailed photographic records serve as important documentation, while transects enable systematic sampling along impacted reaches.
4. Target: Adapting traditional stream sampling protocols for beaver-impacted waterways.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method involve the logistical challenges of accessing and monitoring sites with beaver activity, as well as accounting for seasonal variations in dam building and water levels.
