  "abstractText": "Most adult anadromous salmon die shortly after returning from the sea to spawn in their natal streams. Carcass counts are often done in conjunction with foot-based visual counts of spawning fish and with redd counts.  Salmon carcasses provide important information to scientists, including scales, tissue samples, length measurements, and population sex composition data. Scales and otoliths are used to determine age and offer insights into the populations age characteristics.",
