  "abstractText": "Naturally occurring geochemical signatures in fish otoliths can provide valuable information on natal origins and life histories of individual fish, which can then be extrapolated to make population-level inferences (Campana and Thorrold 2001; Kennedy et al. 1997; Thorrold et al. 2001). As such, otolithmicrochemistry is a powerful tool that enables researchers and managers to determine the natal origins of adult fish. One metric of interest is whether or not adults exhibit any spatial fidelity to their natal tributaries after outmigrating into a larger aquatic system (i.e., as seen with fluvial Rainbow Trout). This inference can inform sampling design when collecting adult fish for an otolithmicrochemistry study, and it can also guide regulation setting and river corridor protection and restoration.",
