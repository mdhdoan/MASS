2. Abstract:
   Spawner counts have been an essential method to estimate mature kokanee abundance, which further helps in calculating total kokanee abundance. Although the spawner counts do not provide an absolute value for kokanee abundance, they effectively show long-term trends and large-scale changes in the species' population. By standardizing the counting process with respect to timing, locations, and methodologies, these data offer valuable insights into kokanee abundance patterns.

3. Description:
   The text describes a method used for estimating kokanee abundance, focusing on spawner counts. Kokanee are landlocked sockeye salmon, and their mature population is often considered an indicator of the total kokanee abundance. Spawner counts do not provide absolute values; however, they offer trend data that can reveal significant changes in kokanee abundance over many years. The methodology used in spawner counts has been standardized to ensure consistent timing, locations, and counting procedures across different studies. This standardization allows researchers to compare and combine data from multiple sources, leading to more reliable estimates of kokanee abundance trends.

4. Target:
   The primary focus of the method is to estimate large-scale changes in kokanee abundance using spawner counts as an index.

5. Constraints:
   Although standardization has been applied, spawner count data may still be influenced by various factors such as environmental conditions, water levels, and accessibility of spawning sites, which could introduce some level of uncertainty or bias in the estimates.
