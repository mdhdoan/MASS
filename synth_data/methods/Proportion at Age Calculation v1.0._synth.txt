2. Abstract: This text discusses the importance of obtaining age data for calculating proportion at age, which in turn is used to compute Recruits per Spawner (method ID: 5411), an indicator of Viable Salmonid Population (VSP). The purpose of this methodology is to assess the current status of populations in terms of extinction risk.
3. Description: The text highlights the necessity of collecting age data, which can be done through scale age analysis or otolith analysis (Method IDs: 1366 or 1462). The proportion at age calculated from this data is essential for determining Recruits per Spawner (method ID: 5411), a VSP indicator. This information is utilized by the Interior Columbia Technical Review Team (ICTRT) to evaluate the extinction risk faced by populations, as described in their 2010 report.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is calculating Recruits per Spawner (method ID: 5411) using age data and assessing extinction risk for salmonid populations.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method include the availability, accuracy, and reliability of age data obtained through scale age analysis or otolith analysis (Method IDs: 1366 or 1462). The accuracy of Recruits per Spawner (method ID: 5411) calculations depends on the quality of this age data.
