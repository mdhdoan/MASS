  "abstract": " This text describes a method used to calculate stream discharge data by combining continuous stage measurements with manual discharge readings. The necessity of this approach is that cross-sectional measurements alone may not be an accurate estimate of actual stream discharge. By incorporating manual discharge measurements, the method aims to improve the accuracy of the calculation.\n\nThe method uses equipment calibrated according to the manufacturer's specifications and follows established USGS (United States Geological Survey) methods for producing reliable discharge data. The combination of continuous stage data with manual readings enables a more comprehensive assessment of stream conditions, addressing potential inaccuracies from relying solely on cross-sectional measurements.\n\nThere is no code included in this text."
