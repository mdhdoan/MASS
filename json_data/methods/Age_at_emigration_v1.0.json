  "abstractText": "For anadromous salmonid species, life history is a trait in which we observe considerable variation. This life history diversity is a critical metric with regard to Viable Salmonid Populations (VSP) (McElhany et al 2000). As such, a full understanding of the life history variation displayed in a population is required to understand the risks to the population and how best to manage those risks.Because most salmonids have overlapping generations, much of the variability is reduced, and therefore the population is more resilient.The age at emigration of anadromous salmonids may have implications related to early marine survival, hydrosystem survival, early maturation, and predation among other impacts. Understanding the age of emigrating juvenile smolts will allow the researcher to better understand the effects of age on sources of mortality and life history in general.",
