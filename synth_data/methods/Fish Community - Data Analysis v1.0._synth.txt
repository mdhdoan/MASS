2. Abstract: This method focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of habitat restoration activities in the Columbia River Estuary for juvenile salmonid ESUs listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). By comparing pre-restoration and post-restoration habitats to reference sites, this approach assesses species composition, temporal abundance patterns, and fish size. This information will be crucial for evaluating and predicting restoration success in the estuary, ultimately contributing to the conservation of these at-risk species.

3. Description: The necessity for habitat restoration in the Columbia River Estuary (CRE) stems from the need to increase available habitat for rearing and migrating juvenile salmonid ESUs listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA. Successful restoration is measured by demonstrating increased habitat use by salmonids at restored locations compared to reference habitats. The primary goal of this method is to evaluate species composition, temporal abundance patterns (using catch per unit effort by date), and fish size (fork length or total length) in pre-restoration habitat, post-restoration habitat, and reference sites. By comparing these metrics across different stages, the effectiveness of restoration efforts can be determined. The long-term objective is to understand the relationship between fish habitat use and physical conditions such as water quality, which will further aid in predicting restoration success in the CRE.

4. Target: Evaluating the effectiveness of habitat restoration activities for threatened or endangered juvenile salmonid ESUs in the Columbia River Estuary.

5. Constraints: The success of this method depends on the availability and accessibility of accurate data on species composition, temporal abundance patterns, and fish size from pre-restoration, post-restoration, and reference sites. Additionally, the reliability of water quality measurements is crucial for understanding their impact on fish habitat use and restoration success.
