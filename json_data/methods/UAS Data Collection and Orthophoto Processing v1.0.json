  "abstractText": "High-resolution imagery is becoming a standard for monitoring river/wetland restoration projects due to cost-effectiveness and a multitude of monitoring metrics that can be calculated from this product.This method builds off of the UAS operation v1.0, Method #6731 [https://www.monitoringresources.org/Document/Method/Details/6731] to provide a more detailed process of data collection to create an orthophoto from an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). This method also provides a standard approach to processing raw photographic data collected using an UAS in Agisoft Metashape but can be generalized to other structure-from-motion photogrammetric programs.",
