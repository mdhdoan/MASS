 1. Abstract: The Wind River Watershed Project is a collaborative effort to restore wild steelhead through habitat restoration and monitoring programs. Real-time streamflow data is provided to aid in managing juvenile traps and designing restoration projects.

2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: 
Values: Protecting and restoring native fish populations and their habitats.
Problem Statement: Declining steelhead populations due to habitat degradation and changing environmental conditions.
Desired Outcomes: Increased steelhead population, improved watershed health, informed decision-making through data-driven insights.

3. Description: The Wind River Watershed Project focuses on restoring wild steelhead by implementing habitat restoration projects and a robust monitoring and evaluation (RM & E) program. Streamflow measurements are taken to manage juvenile traps, provide data for designing and monitoring restoration work, and estimate stream discharge using rating curves. Real-time streamflow data is essential for adaptive management and ensuring effective conservation efforts.

4. Objectives: 
Objective: Provide real-time streamflow data for the Wind River to aid in steelhead conservation efforts.
Summary of Solution Coverage: The provision of real-time data covers a significant portion of the project's monitoring and decision-making needs.
Keywords: Real-time data, streamflow, monitoring, adaptive management, steelhead conservation.

5. Target: Real-time streamflow data for informed decision-making in the Wind River Watershed Project.

6. Constraints: Availability of real-time data may depend on factors such as equipment functionality, communication networks, and budget constraints.
