2. Abstract: This method describes the collection and correlation of weather station data to analyze micro climate responses. The system includes a Vantage Pro console/receiver, Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS), and mounting hardware. The ISS is equipped with various sensors for collecting different types of environmental data, all powered by solar energy. This method aims to provide accurate and consistent data collection to help understand the impacts of climate change on local microclimates.
3. Description: The text outlines a weather station data collection method using a Vantage Pro console/receiver and an Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS). The ISS includes sensors for measuring rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, solar radiation, and UV levels. These sensors are enclosed in a standard radiation shield to ensure accurate measurements. The ISS is designed to be solar-powered with a transmitter and battery located inside the radiation shield. The console can be powered using an AC-power adapter or with three C batteries. The wireless range of the system is up to 400 feet (120 meters) outdoors, line of sight, and can be extended using wireless repeaters for distances up to 0.6 miles (1 km).
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to collect and correlate micro climate responses such as precipitation and atmospheric temperatures to changes in water temperatures and river discharge.
5. Constraints: This method requires a clear line of sight for optimal wireless range, and may be limited by the availability of sunlight for powering the ISS. Additionally, the system's accuracy may be affected by environmental factors such as wind, temperature, and humidity.
