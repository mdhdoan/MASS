  "abstractText": "A HTI model 241 echosounder with two 200 kHz transducers (15split-beam transducer in vertical orientation and a 6 x 10 elliptical split-beam transducer in horizontal orientation) was used to sample, enumerate, and locate fish in the limnetic zone of the lake. Sixteen transects were conducted in an elongated zigzag pattern across the limnetic zone of Banks Lake. Hydroacoustics will detect fish targets, but cannot determine the specesof those targerts. Therefore, gill nets will be used for species verification. Refer to method 6751.",
