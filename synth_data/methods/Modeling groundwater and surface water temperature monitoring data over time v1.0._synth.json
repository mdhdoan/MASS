  "abstract": " This method is used to compare groundwater and surface water temperature cycles in restored and reference areas by analyzing the alignment of their temperature patterns. The goal is to provide evidence that restoration projects are achieving their goals, such as raising the water table or promoting groundwater-surface water exchange. The analysis involves modeling seasonal oscillations in both groundwater and surface water temperatures to examine their amplitude and timing.\n\nThe necessity of this method lies in the importance of monitoring the effects of restoration activities on groundwater temperature patterns. By comparing these patterns with those of reference areas, where no restoration has occurred, it is possible to evaluate the success of the project and identify any changes in water table elevation or groundwater-surface water exchange. The assumption here is that if groundwater temperatures in restored areas align more closely with surface water temperatures, this alignment provides corroborating evidence of the desired outcomes of the restoration project.\n\nThis method assumes that data was collected using Onset HOBOU20Water Level Loggers (U20 probes) for groundwater temperature and either Onset Tidbit v2 or Stowaway XTI loggers for surface water temperature. The data collection resolution should be one reading per hour or two hours for the duration of the monitoring period.\n\nIn summary, this method allows for a thorough evaluation of the impact of restoration projects on groundwater temperature patterns by comparing them with those from reference areas. By examining the alignment of their temperature cycles, it is possible to assess the success of the project and gain valuable insights into water table elevation changes and groundwater-surface water exchange."

  "description": " In this technical analysis, we aim to investigate the relationship between groundwater and surface water temperature cycles in restored and reference areas by comparing their amplitude and synchronicity using data collected from monitoring activities. The assumption is that restoration projects may lead to changes in water table elevation and subsequent groundwater-surface water exchange (Stonestrom and Constantz, 2003).\n\nThe method described herein focuses on analyzing groundwater temperature patterns, assuming the availability of at least one reference site with no restoration activities and one treated site where such activities have taken place. We expect to observe greater alignment between groundwater and surface water temperature cycles in areas where the water table is closer to the land surface due to possible water table rise (Stonestrom and Constantz, 2003).\n\nTo perform this analysis, we model seasonal oscillations in both groundwater and surface water temperature data. The primary goal is to evaluate changes in amplitude and timing of these oscillations since restoration implementation. This methodology relies on the collection of groundwater temperature data using Onset HOBO U20Water Level Loggers (U20 probes) installed as part of a monitoring design, with hourly or two-hourly data resolution for the entire monitoring period.\n\nSimilarly, we require surface water temperature data collected at hourly intervals using hourly monitoring data from loggers such as Onset Tidbit v2 or Stowaway XTI loggers located near treated and control sites. It is important to note that separate analysis of water table elevation data is not covered in this method.\n\nIn summary, we propose a technical procedure for analyzing groundwater temperature cycles in restored and reference areas by comparing their amplitude and synchronicity with surface water temperature patterns. We model seasonal oscillations to evaluate changes since restoration implementation using hourly or two-hourly groundwater temperature data from U20 probes and surface water temperature data from loggers like Tidbit v2 or Stowaway XTI. This analysis provides valuable evidence supporting the achievement of project goals, such as water table rise and groundwater-surface water exchange."

  "constraints": " The given text outlines a method for analyzing groundwater temperature data collected from restoration projects to detect changes in water table elevation and alignment with surface water temperature patterns. Here are the constraints mentioned in the text:\n\n1. Prerequisites for data collection: The method assumes that data were collected from at least one reference site (no manipulations) and one treated site (where restoration activities have occurred). It also requires groundwater temperature data from wells installed as part of a monitoring design, instrumented with Onset HOBOU20Water Level Loggers or similar devices. Additionally, hourly monitoring data from surface water temperature loggers located near the treated and control sites is required.\n\n2. Data resolution: The method assumes that groundwater data were collected at a minimum resolution of one reading per hour or two hours for the duration of the monitoring period. Similarly, surface water temperature data should also be collected hourly.\n\n3. Method assumptions: The method assumes that groundwater data were collected from wells and that groundwater temperature patterns are expected to more closely align with surface water patterns in areas where groundwater is closer to the land surface. It also assumes that groundwater data were collected as part of a restoration monitoring design.\n\n4. Analysis goals: The goal of the analysis is to compare the amplitude and synchronicity of groundwater and surface water temperature cycles in restored and reference areas, providing evidence of water table rise and groundwater-surface water exchange.\n\n5. Data modeling: The method models seasonal oscillations in groundwater and surface water temperature to examine their amplitude and timing and evaluate how these parameters have changed since restoration.\n\nThere are no explicit code snippets mentioned in the text, but the method does suggest using specific types of data loggers (Onset HOBOU20Water Level Loggers and Onset Tidbit v2 or Stowaway XTI loggers) for collecting groundwater and surface water temperature data, respectively. Additionally, it suggests using software or tools capable of modeling seasonal oscillations in temperature data to perform the analysis."
