 1. Keywords: Cyanobacteria, toxins, screening, PTOX, cyanotoxin concentration
2. Abstract: This method outlines the importance of screening samples for potentially toxigenic cyanobacteria (PTOX) to determine if further testing for cyanotoxin concentration is necessary. Cyanobacteria can produce harmful toxins that affect humans, pets, wildlife, and ecosystems. Not all cyanobacteria produce toxins, and those that do can have multiple types. By screening samples using this method, recommendations can be provided on which toxins to analyze, ensuring safe drinking water sources and maintaining a healthy ecosystem.
3. Description: The text details a method for screening samples containing cyanobacteria to identify potentially toxigenic strains (PTOX). Cyanobacteria are known to produce various toxins harmful to humans, pets, wildlife, and the environment. Not all cyanobacteria produce toxins, and those that do can create more than one type. Cyanobacterial blooms may consist of a mix of toxic and non-toxic species, making it crucial to screen samples for PTOX to decide if testing for cyanotoxin concentration is needed. The method follows sample collection according to Method 7178 and uses this screening process to establish if the sample warrants analysis for cyanotoxin concentration.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to screen samples for potentially toxigenic cyanobacteria (PTOX) in order to determine if further testing for cyanotoxin concentration is required.
5. Constraints: This method assumes that the user follows Method 7178 for sample collection and focuses on screening for PTOX, with limitations in providing specifics on which cyanotoxins to analyze without further testing.
