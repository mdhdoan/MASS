  "background": "Walleye are an emerging potential threat to native and desire sport fish populations. Walleye likely entered the lake from an upstream source population. To better understand the role this species will play in the lake, we will evaluate their diet, origin via isotopic analysis, and locations of fish aggregations during spawning via telemetry. We will also evaluate trends in catch rates using fall Walleye index netting methods.",
