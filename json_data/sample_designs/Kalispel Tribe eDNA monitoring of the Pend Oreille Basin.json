  "description": "<p>Environmental DNA&nbsp;(eDNA) samples will be collected opportunitstically, as needed to detect the presence/absence or range of a target species as a direct result of a management action (e.g., non native species suppression/eradication, native species reintroduction), proposed management action, or suspected introduction of an invasive species.&nbsp; The quantity and distribution of samples will depend on the question but follow protocols provided in the literature. Samples can be taken during any calendar months when&nbsp;freezing tempertatures are not present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples of potential sampling include: presence/absence sampling for Brook Trout or Westslope Cutthroat Trout at the suspected upper extent of distribution and or every 200-300 m of stream; sampling of lakes and rivers along shorelines or at tributary mouths for suspected invasion of non-native fish species (e.g., Northern Pike, Lake Trout, Smallmouth Bass, etc).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
