2. Abstract: This method outlines the importance of monitoring juvenile fish populations as an indicator of overall population status. The plan includes using snorkeling and electrofishing to estimate juvenile fish numbers and size. Snorkeling will be the primary sampling method, with both daytime and nighttime surveys conducted for accuracy. Electrofishing, the secondary method, will follow specific protocols and use a removal-depletion method for estimating population numbers. The Fulton-type condition will be used as a metric for juvenile fish well-being.
3. Description: The necessity of monitoring juvenile fish populations is highlighted in this method as an indicator of overall population status. Two methods, snorkeling and electrofishing, are proposed to estimate juvenile fish numbers and size within specific reaches and sites. Snorkeling will be the primary sampling method, with both daytime and nighttime surveys conducted for at least two years to determine which time provides the best estimate of juvenile fish. Each fish observed during day or night surveys will have its size estimated to the nearest 2 cm and reported as fish/ha. Electrofishing is the secondary method and will follow specific protocols outlined in Reynolds (1996) and NMFS (2000). This method recommends using the removal-depletion method with a minimum of three complete passes to estimate population numbers and 95% confidence intervals. The maximum-likelihood formula, as described by Van Deventer and Platts (1989), will be used for estimation. Numbers will be reported as fish/ha. The Fulton-type condition will be used as a metric for the well-being of juvenile fish.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to accurately estimate juvenile fish populations and their size, using snorkeling and electrofishing, to monitor overall population status.
5. Constraints: This method recommends conducting both daytime and nighttime surveys for at least two years to determine which time provides the best estimate of juvenile fish. The removal-depletion method with a minimum of three complete passes is recommended for electrofishing. Population numbers and 95% confidence intervals must be estimated using the maximum-likelihood formula, and all observations must be reported as fish/ha. The Fulton-type condition will be used to assess juvenile fish well-being.
