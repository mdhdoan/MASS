2. Abstract:
Beach seining is a versatile and efficient fish capture method that can be used in various aquatic habitats, such as rivers, estuaries, lakes, reservoirs, and marine environments. This method involves the use of seines, which vary in size and design, depending on the targeted species, habitat, and life stage. Beach seining is most effective in shallow water with few obstructions, where fish are concentrated and less likely to outswim the net. However, careful consideration should be given to environmental factors such as bottom topography, debris, aquatic vegetation, current velocity, and depth to ensure successful seining and minimal harm to captured fish. This method allows for rapid sampling of large areas and facilitates capture and release with minimal stress or injury when conducted properly.

3. Description:
Beach seining is a fishing technique that involves the use of seines, which are long vertical nets with weights at the bottom and floats at the top (Pierce et al., 1990). This method can be used in various aquatic habitats for sampling or harvesting fish. Seining requires careful consideration of several factors to ensure its effectiveness and minimize harm to captured fish:

   - Habitat: The targeted species, water depth, current velocity, and bottom topography are crucial factors when selecting seining sites. Irregular bottom topography, debris, larger rocks, or dense aquatic vegetation may hinder net deployment or reduce fish retention.
   
   - Net design: Seines come in various sizes and configurations to accommodate different species, water conditions, and objectives. The mesh size, length, and shape of the wings, and lead line weight can significantly impact selectivity and capture efficiency.
   
   - Time of year and day: Seasonal and diurnal variations in fish behavior, abundance, and distribution may affect seining success. Consideration should be given to these factors during sampling design and implementation.
   
   - Method: Techniques for deploying, maintaining, and retrieving the net can influence seining efficiency. Observers should monitor underwater conditions and make necessary adjustments during the process. Calibration studies may help improve data analysis and interpretation.

When conducted appropriately, beach seining permits the capture of relatively large fish populations with minimal stress or injury. The most common units for reporting results are fish per volume (e.g., fish/mÂ³) or fish per set. In some cases, fish per unit effort (e.g., fish/hour) might also be used as a metric.

4. Target:
The primary focus of beach seining is to efficiently capture and sample fish populations in various aquatic habitats while minimizing stress, injury, and bycatch.

5. Constraints:
The effectiveness of beach seining can be limited by several constraints, including:
- Environmental factors such as irregular bottom topography, debris, larger rocks, or dense aquatic vegetation that hinder net deployment or reduce fish retention
- Species characteristics like high mobility, swimming speed, or avoidance behavior that make them less susceptible to capture
- Human factors like labor availability and costs associated with gear, boats, and personnel, which can vary from relatively inexpensive to modest depending on the scope and frequency of sampling.
