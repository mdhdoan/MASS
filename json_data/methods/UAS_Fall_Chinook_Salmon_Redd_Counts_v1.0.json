  "abstractText": "Fall Chinook salmon redds observed in unmanned aerial surveys (UAS, aka drones) must be counted from video imagery to ultimately estimate the total number redds in the Hells Canyon spawning area each year. This is done by comparing redds observed in one sampling week to that of the next sampling week and summing the number of new redds seen over the course of the season and using a statistical model to expand counts to the entire river. This is part of a long-term monitoring effort to track annual redd counts for the Snake River fall Chinook salmon population.",
