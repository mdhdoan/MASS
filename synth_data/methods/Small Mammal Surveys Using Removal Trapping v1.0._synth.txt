2. Abstract: The importance of small mammals in maintaining biological diversity and indicating environmental changes is highlighted in this text. To monitor small mammal populations, researchers use removal trapping over live-trapping due to its advantages in positive species identification, reproductive condition determination, and efficiency in capture. This method aids in understanding the effectiveness of management actions towards conservation or restoration goals.
3. Description: Small mammals play a crucial role in ecosystems as seed dispersal agents, soil disturbers, and prey for higher trophic level consumers. Due to their quick response to habitat disturbances, mobility, localized survival needs, and ubiquity, they serve as valuable indicators of environmental change. Removal trapping is the preferred monitoring method because it enables accurate species identification using skull and teeth morphology, determination of reproductive condition, and higher efficiency in capturing small mammals compared to live-trapping.
4. Target: To effectively monitor small mammal populations as indicators of environmental change and assess conservation or restoration efforts.
5. Constraints: The use of removal trapping requires proper knowledge of skull and teeth morphology for accurate species identification, which might be a limiting factor for those without the required expertise. Also, ethical considerations should be taken into account when using this method to minimize animal suffering.
