  "backgroundRationale": "<p>The ISEMP is a collaborative effort to 1) design, test, implement and evaluate Status and Trends Monitoring for salmon and steelhead populations and their habitat and 2) conduct watershed-scale Effectiveness Monitoring for management actions impacting salmon and steelhead populations and habitat in the Interior Columbia River Basin. ISEMP&nbsp;takes a pilot-project approach to the research and development of monitoring by implementing experimental programs in several major subbasins of the Interior Columbia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To achieve these goals, population-specific and aggregate estimates of juvenile abundance and survival are necessary. These metrics will be estimated using information from the recapture of juveniles that are PIT tagged during remote tagging surveys or&nbsp;at rotary screw traps. Recapture data for tagged individuals will be obtained interrogations at Instream PIT Tag Detection Systems (IPTDS) and from recapture at rotary screw traps. ISEMP operated rotary screw traps in the South Fork Salmon and Lemhi rivers to estimate juvenile abundance and survival in those sub-basins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The multiple locations and variable scale nature of this goal requires the standardization of protocols and sampling designs that are statistically valid and powerful. This protocol aims to 1)&nbsp;provide standardization of trapping and fish handling methods among rotary&nbsp;screw traps operated by ISEMP,&nbsp;and 2) provide a brief&nbsp;description of trap efficiency and juvenile abundance estimation methods using rotary screw traps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This monitoring protocol is a component of the overall ISEMP, and while it stands alone as an important contribution to the management of anadromous salmonids and their habitat, it also plays a key role within ISEMP&nbsp;as it is built on a standardized format following Oakley et al. (2003) that all of the ISEMP&nbsp;protocols adhere to. Downstream migrant trapping of juvenile salmonids can be a valuable tool to estimate abundance, production, size, survival, migration timing and behavior (Volkhardt&nbsp;et al. 2007). Of significance to status, trend and effectiveness monitoring programs, simple mark-recapture methods can be used with downstream migrant traps to estimate total freshwater production, and enable the estimation of survival (and mortality) between life stages (e.g., egg-to-smolt).</p>\r\n",

  "objectives": [
    "Provide standardization of trapping and fish handling protocols among rotary screw traps operated by ISEMP in the South Fork Salmon and Lemhi rivers",
    "Indirectly, estimate juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead survival (egg-to-smolt)",
    "Estimate juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead emigration abundance at ISEMP rotary screw traps",
    "Estimate trap efficiency for juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead at ISEMP rotary screw traps"
  ],
  "keyAssumptions": "<p>Regarding efficiency estimates:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Rotary screw traps are function properly (when not attended) on intended trapping days</li>\r\n\t<li>Mortality of marked and unmarked individuals is equal</li>\r\n\t<li>Marked individuals retain their marks (tags) and all tags are detected upon recapture</li>\r\n\t<li>Marked individuals are captured at the same rate as unmarked individuals (no trap avoidance or happiness)</li>\r\n\t<li>Marked individuals mix randomly among unmarked individuals</li>\r\n\t<li>Marked individuals&nbsp;are representative of the entire target population for which abundance and survival will be estimated</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, we assume that trap efficiency estimates accurately reflect the true proportion of the captured emigrating population.</p>\r\n",
  "dataHandlingConsiderations": "Data are recorded on standardized data forms on waterproof paper and entered on a laptop computer at the field site. PIT tag files are stored in P3 and later uploaded to PTAGIS.P3, also known as PITTag3, is a data entry, edit, and validation tool developed expressly to facilitate the collection of PIT tag mark/recapture data in the Columbia/Snake river basins. P3 can be downloaded at: http://www.ptagis.org/software/softwaredetails/p3",
  "qualityControlConsiderations": "Electronic data forms and P3 require that all necessary data fields are completed. Data are reviewed daily and checked for accuracy. Any suspected errors are reviewed with the crew members who entered the data prior to make any changes to data prior to upload to PTAGIS. Further, PTAGIS provides its own data review and error checking process.",
  "reportingConsiderations": "Individual biological data and PIT tag data for tagged juveniles (and subsequent detection data) are stored and publicly available at PTAGIS (www.ptagis.org). Moreover, individual biological and count data are stored in a central database located on a QCI server housed in Boise, ID. Data are synthesized and summarized in annual reports to the Bonneville Power Administration.\r\n",
  "equipmentCleaningAndCalibration": "The screw trap cone must be cleaned and cleared of debris, periodically. Special attention must be given to the screw trap cone and equipment during high and increasing river flows. Large debris entering the cone may stop the cone from turning and/or damage the structure which may result in fish mortality. Screw trap pontoons, trap boxes, and cone, etc. must periodically be examined for damage and maintenance completed as needed. The trap box livewell and revolving debris drum must also be cleared regularly to ensure optimal conditions for captured fish.",
  "rolesAndResponsibilities": "Crew leaders hire field technicians for daily operation of rotary screw traps. Crew leaders also assign scheduling of technicians, provide training to technicians, ensure that technicians abide by established protocols, provide data QA/QC, analyze data, produce reports, and assist at needed at field sites.\r\n\r\nTechnicians are tasked with data collection at the field site including fish identification, enumerating fish to species, collecting lengths and weights, recording data on data forms and on a field laptop, providing trap maintenance, and PIT tagging juvenile salmonids of adequate size.",
  "qualifications": "Crew leaders are typically fisheries biologists and should have adequate leadership skills and, ideally, prior experience operating and managing rotary screw traps. Crew leaders are in charge of hiring and reviewing qualifications of potential technicians. Technicians should be organized and have excellent data recording skills as well as be able to tolerate long hours in potentially harsh conditions.",
  "trainingRequirements": "Juvenile fish identification skills are necessary for all personnel. See Pollard et al. 1997 for reference. Crew should also exhibit mechanical aptitude for installation of rotary screw traps and modification of screw trap rigging as necessary.",
  "safetyConsiderations": "Individuals must exercise extreme caution when operating rotary screw traps. Personal flotation devices should be used when getting to rotary screw traps and when operating on the rotary screw trap. Operations may occur in harsh weather (snow, hail, rain, lightning) and caution should be taken during those times.\r\n\r\nPrecautions should also be taken when anesthetizing, handling, and PIT tagging juvenile salmonids to minimize potential mortality of captured individuals.",
  "fieldScheduleNotes": "Rotary screw traps must be attended to and fish processed daily during the trapping season. Rotary screw traps are generally installed instream in spring when instream conditions allow (e.g., snow has melted adequately, ice is gone, site location is accessible). Rotary screw trap should be closely monitored during high flows are during/after heavy rain events and should be removed if debris is present in the river or if flows are too high for safe operation. Trap is generally removed in late fall when ice begins appearing in river.",
  "budgetConsiderations": "Rotary screw traps are expensive and should be closely monitored (especially during high flows) to minimize damage to the trap. Maintenance can be difficult and expensive. Operation of the trap must occur daily during the trapping season, and thus, require a lot of staff time.",
