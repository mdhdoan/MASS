2. Abstract: This document presents the Environmental Assessment Program's (EAP) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for manually collecting water samples from surface waters. The SOP details methods for obtaining representative samples using secondary collection devices from boats and bridges while excluding unattended automated sampling, pelagic marine sampling, or groundwater sampling. The procedure ensures proper sampling from various sources, including freshwater or brackish water lotic and lentic waters, wastewater treatment plants, outfalls, pipes, drains, and through wading on beaches and from boats and bridges.
3. Description: The EAP Water Quality Studies Unit Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) focuses on the manual collection of representative water samples from surface waters for further analysis. This SOP is specifically designed to exclude unattended automated sampling, pelagic marine sampling, or groundwater sampling. It covers various scenarios and locations for sample collection such as freshwater or brackish water lotic and lentic waters, wastewater treatment plants, outfalls, pipes, drains, and through wading on beaches and from boats and bridges. The SOP for the EAP long-term freshwater and marine sampling programs share similar elements in their procedures. Compliance with this SOP is necessary to ensure standardization and quality in manual water sample collection for surface water studies.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to establish a unified procedure for manually collecting water samples from diverse surface water sources, ensuring representativeness and adherence to the Environmental Assessment Program's standards.
5. Constraints: This SOP does not cover unattended automated sampling, pelagic marine sampling, or groundwater sampling. Additionally, it assumes that users possess a basic understanding of water sample collection techniques, relevant safety guidelines, and necessary permits for accessing various sampling locations.
