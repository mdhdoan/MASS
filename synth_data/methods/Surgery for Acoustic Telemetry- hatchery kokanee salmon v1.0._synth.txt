2. Abstract: This method involves the use of acoustic tracking to study the behavior and distribution patterns of kokanee fish in Lake Roosevelt and the upper Columbia River. The tracking system utilizes Vemco VR2W and VR2 receivers, which are submersible devices that monitor the environment for digitally coded transmitter signals from implanted fish. This method allows researchers to identify and record the movements of individual fish, providing valuable insights into their behavior and potential spawning locations.
3. Description: The use of acoustic tracking in this study involves the surgical implantation of V7-2X Vemco transmitters into kokanee fish from a hatchery. These transmitters emit digitally coded signals that can be detected by the Vemco receivers, which are moored to Rolyan Buoys along the river. The receivers are omnidirectional units that record the time, date, and identity of each fish that swims within a given range, allowing researchers to track their movements and identify potential spawning locations. The necessity of this method lies in its ability to provide detailed information about the behavior and distribution patterns of kokanee fish, which is crucial for conservation efforts.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to assess the distribution patterns, probability of entrainment, and potential spawning locations of kokanee fish in Lake Roosevelt and the upper Columbia River.
5. Constraints: One constraint of this method is the need for surgical implantation of transmitters into the fish, which requires careful handling and may cause some stress to the animals. Additionally, the range of detection for the receivers may be limited, requiring a sufficient number of receivers to be deployed in order to effectively track the movements of the fish.
