  "background": "The Colville Confederated Tribes (CCT) Resident Fish Division operates the Colville Resident Fish Hatchery Programto address a host of resident fish management goals on the CCT Reservation in northeast Washington State. Due to the development and operation of the Federal hydroelectric system in the Columbia River, CCT tribal member access to anadromous fish resources was largely eliminated with the completion of Chief Joseph Dam, which did not provide upstream passage facilities for fishes. Mitigation for lost access to fish resources upstream of Chief Joseph Dam includes use of hatchery-origin Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis, and Lahontan Cutthroat Trout O. clarkii henshawi in waterbodies on and bordering the CCT Reservation.Annually, a minimum of 22,697 kg of fish are stocked on CCT reservation waters. The goal of the monitoring and evaluation program is to provide information and recommendations that help guide fish stocking and management decisions for individual water bodies based on fisheries performance objectives.",
