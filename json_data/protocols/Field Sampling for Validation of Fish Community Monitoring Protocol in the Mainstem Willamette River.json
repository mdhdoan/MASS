  "background": "Previous monitoring of the mainstem Willamette River from 2011 to 2013 provided an important baseline for future monitoring of native and non-native fish communities and evaluation of status and trends. However, how fish assemblages and different species of salmonids use mainstem rearing habitats, particularly in warmer seasons and water temperatures, is not well described because of temperature limitations on when and where sampling can occur. In addition, future comparisons to evaluate trends in native and nonnative fish communities with those circa 2010 will be hampered by inherent biases of sampling methods and protocols. Different species and different sizes of fish have different capture probabilities because of behavior, efficiency in different habitats, and the physics of electrofishing. The proposed work is designed to make categorical estimates of:  abundance of native and non-native fish  richness of native and non-native fish communities  proportion of native fish species  proportion of salmonids across a broad range of habitats in the mainstem Willamette, McKenzie, Santiam, and Middle Fork Willamette rivers, and determine the repeatability of this estimates. Information gained on the use of mainstem habitats by juvenile salmonids will be used to help Action Agencies and the Services make adaptive management decisions on a year-to-year basis, will provide valuable occupancy and habitat use information in warmer water conditions to inform long-term management planning, and will aid in evaluating the effectiveness of temperature and habitat restoration mitigation measures.Ultimately data collected in this effort will be used to validate the fish community monitoring protocol used in 2011-13, determine the repeatability of boat and backpack electrofishing, and assess the status of native and non-native fish communities in the Willamette River basin. In addition, project collaborators will incorporate products in the SLICES framework, providing a common archive and information resource regarding ecological status and trends.Note that this is a collaborative project between Oregon State University (OSU) and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW).ODFW's role relating to this sampling protocol is primarily data collection; this is reflected in the objectives listed below. All of the analysis and reporting (except that which is required by ODFW's BPA contract) will be conducted by OSU.",
