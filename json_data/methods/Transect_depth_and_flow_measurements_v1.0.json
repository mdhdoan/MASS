  "abstractText": "There are many potential limitations to rearing spring Chinook growth and survival in regulated river basins. Pearsons et al. (2007) speculated that factors limiting the growth and/or survival of juvenile spring Chinook salmon might differ depending upon past habitat alteration and present flow management.Many river basins arehighly regulated for irrigation purposes with unnatural flow regimes that result in a wide habitat shifts both spatially and temporally. Transect depth and flow is measured and collected in three equally spaced locations within the site habitat type. Each transect is broken into five equally spaced sections where depth, mean flow and densiometer readings are taken across each transect (see method #224 for densiometer readings).",
