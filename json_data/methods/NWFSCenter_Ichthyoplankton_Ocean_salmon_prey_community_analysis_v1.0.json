  "abstractText": "These cruises are part of a long-termBonnevillePower Administration-funded effort by academic and federal scientists to understand coastal ecosystems and biological and physical processes that may influence recruitment variability of salmon in Pacific Northwest waters. Presently, research is focused on examining the effects of biotic andabioticenvironmental conditions on the early marine life history of coho and Chinook salmon. This research focused on the Columbia River Plume and its importance for juvenile salmon and highertrophiclevel predators because this is an area of highsalmonidabundance and it is influenced by anthropogenic factors.In addition to exploring winter ichthyoplankton prey biomass, we calculate annually if changes in ichthyoplankton composition or the fish larval prey community and how this relates to salmon marine survival. This extends our analysis from the amount of food available to salmon (biomass) to whether the type of fish available to juvenile salmon may affect salmon survival.",
