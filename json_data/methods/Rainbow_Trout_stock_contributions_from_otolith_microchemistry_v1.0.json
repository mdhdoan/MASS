  "abstractText": "One common application of otolith microchemistry is to determine where (spatially) adult fish originated from (i.e., where they were spawned) based on Sr 87/86 ratios present near the core of the fish's otolith. At the population-scale, it is valuable to know where the majority of fish originated from to help with guiding regulation setting, stream protection, stream restoration, etc. The piece of information can certainly help with prioritization.",
