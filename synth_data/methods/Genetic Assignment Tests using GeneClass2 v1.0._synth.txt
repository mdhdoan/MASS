2. Abstract: This text discusses the use of various software programs to assign individuals of unknown origin to specific populations using genetic data. Five methods and their respective software packages were evaluated for their ability to distinguish hatchery offspring from wild steelhead. Despite low differentiation between wild and hatchery fish and violations of assumptions, all methods provided high assignment success, making them robust options for ecological studies requiring accurate classification of different groups.
3. Description: The text describes a study conducted by Hauser et al. (2006) that evaluated five software programs for their ability to accurately assign hatchery offspring to sympatric wild steelhead populations. Methods included Bayesian, frequency-based, and distance-based assignment with a baseline, as well as a clustering and Bayesian detection method not requiring a baseline. The five computer programs used were whichrun, geneclass2, gma (genetic mixture analysis), bayes, structure, and baps 3.1. Despite low differentiation between wild and hatchery fish (FST = 0.02) and violations of assumptions, all methods provided high assignment success, demonstrating their robustness for ecological studies that require correct classification of different groups. The text then focuses on the methods for performing assignment tests in GeneClass2, a software that computes various genetic assignment criteria to assign or exclude reference populations as the origin of diploid or haploid individuals, as well as groups of individuals, based on multilocus genotype data.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is on accurately assigning individuals of unknown origin to specific populations using genetic data.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this current method include low differentiation between wild and hatchery fish (FST = 0.02) and violations of assumptions, all of which could potentially impact the accuracy of the assignment. However, despite these constraints, the methods were still able to provide high assignment success.
