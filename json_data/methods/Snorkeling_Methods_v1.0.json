  "abstractText": "Sampling for spring and summer Chinook salmon and summer steelhead will occur from June 1 to approximately September 15.  The studies will collect fish density (number/m2), biomass (grams/m2), fish size, and condition factor data per age group of juvenile anadromous salmonids.  Snorkeling counts are the main sampling tool used, by habitat type, to determine density and relative abundance of juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead of natural and hatchery origin as well as other co-existing species. Snorkeling observations are conducted in areas of representative habitat types.",
