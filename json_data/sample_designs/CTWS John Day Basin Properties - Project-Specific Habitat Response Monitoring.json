Therefore, each habitat restorartion project will have a monitoring plan tailored to that particular&nbsp;projects specific goals and objectives, and will outline the monitoring techniques and methdos to be used at each site. Additionally, monitoring plans will outline the purpose for data being collected, what management questions or goals/objectives they are being used to address, and how the data being collected will be analyzed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
