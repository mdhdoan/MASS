2. Abstract: This method outlines the process of collecting data on human impact along 11 evenly spaced transects at each site. The measurement procedure is restricted to the main channel and must adhere to a specified method for establishing major transects (method ID 3828). This approach allows for standardized, systematic evaluation of human influence in a specific area.
3. Description: The method describes the step-by-step process of gathering measurements related to human impact within a defined waterway. Researchers are instructed to establish 11 evenly spaced transects at each site, with measurements limited to the main channel. This approach is based on method ID 3828 for setting up major transects, ensuring consistency and comparability across different sites.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to assess human impact within a specific water body by systematically collecting data along predefined transects in the main channel.
5. Constraints: This method requires adherence to an established method (method ID 3828) for setting up major transects, limiting measurements to the main channel, and focusing on human influence assessments.
