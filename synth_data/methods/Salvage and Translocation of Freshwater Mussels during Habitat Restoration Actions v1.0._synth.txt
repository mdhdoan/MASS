2. Abstract: The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has developed best management practices (BMPs) to protect freshwater mussels during aquatic and riparian habitat restoration activities. With many freshwater mussel species experiencing population declines, there is a critical need to conserve existing populations and protect ecosystem services provided by healthy mussel populations. The BMPs, detailed in "Conserving the Gems of our Waters" (2018), provide methods for incorporating freshwater mussels into project planning timelines, restoration site prioritization, and implementation of restoration activities within the CTUIR ceded territory. The focus of this study is to evaluate and improve suggested BMPs related to salvage and translocation of mussels, acknowledging that while translocation carries risks such as high mortality rates, it may be a better option than leaving mussels in areas with anticipated 100% mortality due to impacts like dewatering.

3. Description: The necessity for BMPs arises from the widespread population declines of freshwater mussel species and the need to protect existing populations from further harm, as well as protect aquatic ecosystems from the loss of services provided by healthy mussels. The Xerces Society's "Conserving the Gems of our Waters" (2018) outlines BMP methods applied in this study, focusing solely on salvage and translocation of mussels impacted by habitat restoration activities within the CTUIR ceded territory. Translocations often result in high mortality rates, but they may still be preferable to leaving mussels in areas with anticipated 100% mortality due to impacts like dewatering. The study seeks to improve knowledge of specific restoration actions' impact on freshwater mussels by applying multiple methods as experimental treatments and addressing uncertainties related to translocation procedures through variable methods such as differing re-stocking densities and placement strategies.

4. Target: The primary focus is to evaluate and improve suggested BMPs for salvage and translocation of freshwater mussels impacted by habitat restoration activities in the CTUIR ceded territory, aiming to reduce mortality rates and protect mussel populations.

5. Constraints: Translocations often result in high mortality rates, and understanding how mussels can withstand specific impacts such as pulsed sediment loads is not as clearly understood. This requires applying multiple methods as experimental treatments, which relies on receiving site characteristics and the mussel population in that river reach. Uncertainties may be addressed for translocation procedures by applying multiple methods as treatment groups (e.g. variable re-stocking densities, specific placement strategies of translocated mussels), but this also depends on receiving site characteristics and the mussel population in that river reach.
