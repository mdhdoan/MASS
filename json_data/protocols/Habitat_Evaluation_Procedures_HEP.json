  "background": "This document was developed to provide consistency with how habitat variable data is collected throughout the Columbia Basin Region in support of the Columbia River Wildlife Mitigation Program funded by Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). This publication is a stand alone reference for Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) and Combined Habitat Assessment Protocols (CHAP) transect techniques used by the Regional HEP Team (RHT).This document is intended to be a user friendly habitat variable measurement technique manual for both novice and experienced field technicians alike. As a result, theory and mathematical/statistical discussions are held to a minimum. It is assumed that field technicians will possess the specific measuring devices discussed in this manual. Thus, device descriptions are limited in most cases.English measurements e. g., inches, feet, etc., are used to accommodate measurements found in many HEP models and because English measurements are better understood by the general public. English measurements can easily be converted to metric equivalents if needed.General and specific protocols are described in the following sections. General protocols include a brief description of pre HEP survey pilot studies; transect establishment guidelines, and photo documentation parameters. In contrast, specific metrics detail actual habitat variable measurement techniques including diagrams where additional explanation is needed. In cases where more than one measurement technique option is possible, options are assigned an alpha-numeric code. This allows project managers and field technicians to identify specific measurement techniques in report tables and data spreadsheets without lengthy, redundant explanations.This field techniques manual is intended to be a living document and will be modified as needed. The following standardized protocols and measurement techniques are used by the Regional HEP team to measure habitat variables described in HEP models and used in conjunction with CHAP verification transects.",
