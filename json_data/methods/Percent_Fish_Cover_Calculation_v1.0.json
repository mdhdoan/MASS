Cover is estimated for each channel unit, then a weighted average (based on channel unit area) is calculated for either the entire site or for each tier within a site.Percent fish cover is calculated for each type of cover: Large Woody Debris (LWD), Vegetation, Undercut Banks, Aquatic Vegetation, or Artificial. The total percent cover, as well as the area with no cover, are also calculated.The CHaMP - Fish Cover Elements Method provides background on collection of the measurement data that are analyzed for this calculation.
