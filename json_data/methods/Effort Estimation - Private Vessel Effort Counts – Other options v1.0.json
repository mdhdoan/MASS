  "abstractText": "There are other options that are sometimes utilized for making effort counts or in evaluating current count methods.  At Port Orford, boats must be lowered off an elevated dock directly into the ocean.  Here ORBS has been able to get counts of hoist launches from the Port of Port Orford, and so no other effort has been needed.  We often collect effort count information from the US Coast Guard at several different ports as a cross check on our effort counts, but in general the US Coast Guard has other priorities and their bar crossing counts have not been found to be reliable enough for our purposes.",
