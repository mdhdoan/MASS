 1. Abstract: The Lake Roosevelt Habitat Improvement Project (LRHIP) aims to enhance migratory rainbow trout survival and increase Tribal subsistence and recreational opportunities by restoring stream habitat and ecological function in the Colville Confederated Tribes reservation's rivers. A more structured, statistically rigorous approach is introduced to tackle identified shortcomings in previous monitoring and restoration efforts, incorporating an Ecosystem Diagnosis and Treatment (EDT) model for prioritizing high-benefit habitat restoration areas.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: The project values the importance of preserving and restoring salmonid populations, emphasizes statistical rigor in monitoring efforts, and aims to establish a clear priority strategy in habitat restoration actions. The problem statement revolves around the previous unstructured approach to LRHIP, which lacked proper study design and prioritization for habitat improvement. Desired outcomes include improved fish performance, better habitat conditions, and more robust monitoring studies.
3. Description: The text outlines a revamped approach to the LRHIP project, integrating empirical data, local expert input, and analytical models like EDT to ensure effective prioritization of high-benefit areas for salmonid population restoration. Detailed methods include collecting specific temperature data at logger locations, monitoring Sanpoil River discharge, and using the collected information for evaluating EDT Level II attributes related to temperature and discharge.
4. Objectives: The main objective is to develop an improved approach to habitat restoration and protection in LRHIP by implementing a structured prioritization system based on empirical data, expert input, and analytical models. This objective covers the entire problem statement of unstructured previous approaches to LRHIP. Keywords include Lake Roosevelt Habitat Improvement Project, Ecosystem Diagnosis and Treatment (EDT) model, statistical rigor, habitat restoration prioritization, and salmonid population improvement.
5. Target: The primary focus is on enhancing the approach to rainbow trout habitat restoration and monitoring within the LRHIP project in the Colville Confederated Tribes reservation's rivers.
6. Constraints: Time, budget, availability of relevant empirical data, cooperation from local experts, and potential limitations in the EDT model.
