  "background": "The Hood River Production Master Planwas adopted by the NWPCC in 1992 and its overarching goal was to protect, enhance and restore wild and natural populations of anadromous and resident fish within the Hood River Subbasin.Program specific goals as defined by TheHood River Production Program Revised Master Plan (HDR/Fish Pro2008) included:Increasing production of wild summer and winter steelhead trout commensurate with the subbasins current carrying capacityRe-introducing spring Chinook salmon into the Hood River SubbasinDevelop guidelines for implementing the hatchery supplementation program in a manner that will minimize its impact on indigenous resident and anadromous populations.Monitoring salmonid smolts and resident speciesduring out-migration provides a measurement ofsubbasin productivity during the freshwater life stage within the Hood River. Trends in abundance serve as a primary indicator of species recovery potential and to provide insight into the effect the hatchery program is having on non-supplemented resident and anadromous species.",

  "assumptions": "<p>We assume that winter steelhead are native to the East and Middle Forks of the Hood River, and summer steelhead are native to the West Fork Hood River. We assume that marked individuals have the same opportunity to be caught in rotary screw traps as those who are caught for the first time.</p>\r\n",
  "objectives": [
    "Estimate steelhead and spring Chinook smolt production\r\n",
    "Monitor juvenile rainbow-steelhead abundance status and trends \r\n",
    "Monitor status and trends of non-supplemented species including Coho, fall Chinook, cutthroat trout, bull trout, and other resident and andromous species."
