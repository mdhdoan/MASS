 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are five keywords that summarize the main topics and themes covered in the text body:

1. Stream discharge
2. Velocity-area methods
3. Discharge measurements
4. Water chemistry data
5. Equipment requirements

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
Stream discharge measurement is crucial for assessing trends in streamwater acidity and other sensitive characteristics that are affected by streamflow differences. The preferred procedure for obtaining discharge data is based on velocity-area methods, which involve measuring the mean current velocity and vertical cross sectional area of flowing water. While this method is widely applicable, it has some constraints, such as the requirement for specific equipment that may not be suitable for very small or shallow streams.

3. Description:
The text provides a detailed explanation of how to measure stream discharge using velocity-area methods. The formula for calculating discharge is given as the product of mean current velocity and vertical cross sectional area of flowing water. Discharge measurements are important for interpreting the representativeness of water chemistry data and some physical habitat information, as well as assessing trends in streamwater acidity and other sensitive characteristics. The text notes that no single method is applicable to all types of stream channels and that data will not be collected for streams that are too small or shallow to use the equipment required for the velocity-area procedure.

4. Target:
The primary focus of the method described in the text is to provide a standardized procedure for measuring stream discharge using velocity-area methods.

5. Constraints:
The constraints of the method include the requirement for specific equipment, which may not be suitable for very small or shallow streams. Additionally, the method requires that the stream channel have a stable cross section and that there is no significant backwater or other flow interference.
