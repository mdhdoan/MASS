  "abstract": " The text describes a method for measuring the bankfull width of a wetted channel at all main and intermediate transects. This measurement is important for assessing the size and capacity of a waterbody, which can impact flood risk management and ecological health. The guidance for measuring the wetted width at dry transects can be found in Appendix C of the cited protocol.\n\nIn simpler terms, this method involves taking measurements of the width of the channel that is covered by water during times of heavy rain or flooding. These measurements are taken at several points along the channel to provide a comprehensive understanding of the size and shape of the waterbody. By collecting these data, we can gain valuable insights into the capacity of the waterbody and how it may behave during flood events.\n\nThis information is crucial for effective flood risk management and ecological assessment, as understanding the size and shape of a waterbody can help us predict potential flooding risks and evaluate the health of aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, these measurements can be used to inform infrastructure projects, such as building new bridges or modifying existing ones, to ensure they are designed to accommodate the necessary flow volumes."

  "description": " This text outlines a procedure for measuring the bankfull width of a wetted channel at both main and intermediate transects. The term \"bankfull width\" refers to the width of the channel when it is fully saturated with water during a flood event. The measurement is to be taken at specified locations indicated as main and intermediate transects.\n\nThe method for measuring the wetted width at dry transects is provided in Appendix C of the cited protocol. It is essential to follow this guidance when determining the width at transects that are not currently underwater.\n\nTo perform the measurement, locate and identify the main and intermediate transects. Once you have reached these points, determine the width of the wetted channel by measuring from one bank to the opposite bank at each location. Be sure to adhere strictly to the guidelines specified in Appendix C for accurate results.\n\nIn summary, measure the bankfull width of the wetted channel at designated transects - main and intermediate. Utilize the information provided in Appendix C for guidance on measuring the wetted width at dry transects."

  "constraints": " The text body describes a method for measuring the bankfull width of a wetted channel at all main and intermediate transects. The following constraints can be identified from the text:\n\n1. Measuring should be done at all main and intermediate transects.\n2. The measurement should be taken at the wetted channel width.\n3. For measuring at dry transects, refer to Appendix C of the cited protocol for guidance.\n\nTherefore, the constraints are clearly stated in the text itself. The first constraint is mentioned as \"Measure the bankfull width of the wetted channel at all main and intermediate transects.\" The second constraint is implied as \"Measure the bankfull width at the wetted channel\" since the term \"wetted channel\" indicates that the measurement should be taken where water flows during a flood event. The third constraint is stated in the phrase \"See Appendix C of the cited protocol for guidance on measuring wetted width at dry transects.\"\n\nHere's some sample code to illustrate how these constraints could be implemented in a script:\n\n```python\nimport appendix_c as apc\n\ndef measure_bankfull_width(transect, is_wet):\n    \"\"\"Measures the bankfull width of a channel at a given transect.\n    \n    Args:\n        transect (float): The x-coordinate of the transect.\n        is_wet (bool): A flag indicating whether the transect is wet or dry.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The bankfull width at the given transect.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not is_wet:\n        # For dry transects, refer to Appendix C of the protocol for guidance\n        return apc.get_dry_transect_width(transect)\n    \n    # For wet transects, measure the width at the wetted channel\n    return get_wetted_channel_width(transect)\n```"
