  "abstract": " In this collaborative project between Oregon State University (OSU) and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), the team aims to collect data on fish communities in various rivers within the Willamette River basin. The previous monitoring from 2011 to 2013 provided a baseline for future assessments, but there is a need to understand how different fish species use mainstem rearing habitats, particularly during warmer seasons and higher water temperatures. To address this issue and provide valuable data for adaptive management decisions and long-term planning, the team plans to:\n\n1. Estimate the abundance of native and non-native fishes.\n2. Determine the richness of native and non-native fish communities.\n3. Calculate the proportion of native species within these communities.\n4. Assess the proportion of salmonids across various habitats in the mainstem Willamette, McKenzie, Santiam, and Middle Fork Willamette rivers.\n5. Determine the repeatability of these estimates.\n\nTo accomplish these objectives, ODFW will primarily focus on data collection, while Oregon State University will conduct all analyses and reporting (except for that required by ODFW's BPA contract).\n\nThis sampling protocol is crucial to gather information on fish communities and water/habitat quality in the Willamette River basin. The findings will help agencies make year-to-year adaptive management decisions, inform long-term planning, and evaluate the effectiveness of temperature and habitat restoration mitigation measures. Additionally, this project will contribute to the SLICES framework, providing a common archive for ecological status and trends.\n\nThe team acknowledges that differences in environmental conditions between 2011-13 and 2017 do not significantly impact sampling results. Electrofishing efficiency remains consistent among years, as does crew experience and ability. Detectable changes in fish communities can be identified using this protocol, and sufficient sampling is being conducted to effectively evaluate the protocol. The time frame and logistics for data collection in 2017 align with past efforts.\n\nIn summary, the team will collect data on fish populations, water quality, and physical habitat across various rivers within the Willamette River basin. This information will support adaptive management decisions, long-term planning, and the evaluation of restoration measures. The consistency in environmental conditions, crew experience, electrofishing efficiency, and sampling effort increases confidence in the accuracy and repeatability of these estimates."

  "problem_statement": " The sampling protocol described in the text is aimed at collecting data to estimate the abundance of native and non-native fishes, richness of native and non-native fish communities, proportion of native species, and proportion of salmonids across a broad range of habitats in the mainstem Willamette, McKenzie, Santiam, and Middle Fork Willamette rivers. The protocol also aims to determine the repeatability of these estimates and assess the status of native and non-native fish communities in the Willamette River basin. Additionally, water quality and physical habitat data are collected at sites sampled for fish and in known coldwater refuges to determine their suitability as fish habitat. The ultimate goal is to use this information to inform adaptive management decisions on a year-to-year basis, provide valuable occupancy and habitat use information in warmer water conditions, and aid in evaluating the effectiveness of temperature and habitat restoration mitigation measures.\n\nTherefore, the problem the protocol is trying to solve can be stated as follows:\n\nGiven a set of rivers (mainstem Willamette, McKenzie, Santiam, and Middle Fork Willamette), determine the abundance, richness, proportion of native species, and proportion of salmonids for both native and non-native fish communities across different habitats. Additionally, assess the suitability of sampled sites as fish habitat based on water quality and physical habitat data to inform management decisions and evaluate the effectiveness of temperature and habitat restoration measures."

  "description": " The text describes a collaborative project between Oregon State University (OSU) and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) aimed at collecting data to estimate various metrics related to fish communities in the Willamette River basin. The primary focus is on estimating the abundance of native and non-native fishes, richness of native and non-native fish communities, proportion of native species, and proportion of salmonids across a broad range of habitats in the mainstem Willamette, McKenzie, Santiam, and Middle Fork Willamette rivers.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, electrofishing will be used for data collection. This non-lethal method involves using an electric current to immobilize fish, which are then identified, measured, and released. The data gained from this effort will be used to validate the fish community monitoring protocol used in 2011-13, determine the repeatability of boat and backpack electrofishing, and assess the status of native and non-native fish communities in the Willamette River basin.\n\nAdditionally, water quality data will be collected at sites sampled for fish and in known coldwater refuges to determine their suitability as fish habitat. Physical habitat data will also be gathered at these sites to evaluate their potential as fish habitats. The project collaborators aim to provide valuable occupancy and habitat use information in warmer water conditions, aid in evaluating the effectiveness of temperature and habitat restoration mitigation measures, and contribute products to the SLICES framework for archival and information-sharing purposes.\n\nODFW's role in this project is primarily data collection, while OSU will conduct all analysis and reporting (except what's required by ODFW's BPA contract). The differences in environmental conditions between 2011-13 and 2017 are not expected to affect sampling results, as electrofishing efficiency remains consistent among years. Crew experience and abilities are also similar, allowing for detectable changes in fish communities using this protocol. Adequate sampling is being conducted to effectively evaluate the protocol, with logistics remaining consistent with past efforts.\n\nTechnical terms:\n- Electrofishing: a non-lethal method used to immobilize fish using an electric current.\n- Abundance: the number of individuals of a species in a given area.\n- Richness: the total number of different species present in a given area.\n- Proportion of native species: the percentage of captured fish that are native to the area.\n- Proportion of salmonids: the percentage of captured fish that belong to the salmonid family.\n- Water quality data: information on various aspects of water, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity.\n- Physical habitat data: measurements of the physical characteristics of a habitat, including substrate type, flow velocity, and depth.\n- Fish communities: aggregations of different fish species in a given area.\n- Occupancy and habitat use information: data on which fish species inhabit certain areas and how they utilize those habitats.\n- Temperature and habitat restoration mitigation measures: efforts to restore fish habitat and address temperature issues that may negatively impact fish populations.\n- SLICES framework: a common archive and information resource for ecological status and trends.\n- BPA contract: an agreement between ODFW and another organization, likely the Bonneville Power Administration, outlining specific requirements for data reporting."
