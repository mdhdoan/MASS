  "abstract": " This method describes an efficient and cost-effective approach to monitoring river and wetland restoration projects using high-resolution imagery from Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). The process builds on existing UAS operation methods, specifically Method #6731, to collect detailed data for creating orthophotos. An orthophoto is a geographically accurate, rectified image that can be used to measure various monitoring metrics. This method offers a standardized approach to processing raw photographic data using software like Agisoft Metashape, although it can also be applied to other photogrammetric programs. By employing this method, restoration projects can benefit from more detailed and accurate information for assessing progress and identifying areas in need of attention."

  "description": " This technical description focuses on the process of creating high-resolution orthophotos from Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) imagery for river and wetland restoration projects. The method outlined builds upon Method #6731 from MonitoringResources.org, providing a more intricate workflow for collecting data and generating orthophotos using Agisoft Metashape or similar photogrammetric software.\n\nFirst, high-resolution imagery is utilized as the standard monitoring technique due to its cost-effectiveness and the wide range of metrics calculable from such data. UAS operations v1.0 Method #6731 serves as a foundation for this process.\n\nThe procedure initiates with the acquisition of raw photographic data using an UAS. This imagery is essential for producing a precise orthophoto. The raw images undergo a series of processing steps within Agisoft Metashape or similar structure-from-motion (SfM) software.\n\nThe SfM algorithm identifies and matches common features between adjacent images, generating a 3D point cloud model of the target area. This step is crucial for accurately registering the georeferenced images to their correct position on the earth. Next, the algorithm calculates the camera positions for each image based on these correspondences, allowing for accurate triangulation and depth estimation.\n\nThe orthophoto generation process involves rectifying the individual images based on the calculated camera positions and orientations. This step ensures that all features within the imagery align accurately with their true ground position. Additionally, any distortions caused by lens or perspective effects are corrected during this stage.\n\nFinally, the resulting rectified images are merged to create a single, seamless orthophoto of the target area. The high-resolution image offers detailed insights into river and wetland restoration projects, enabling accurate monitoring of changes and assessments for further improvements.\n\nThis method can be generalized to other SfM photogrammetric software, maintaining its utility across various platforms."
