  "abstractText": "The purpose of this method is to use mark and recapture information to estimate the abundance of predators of juvenile salmon in study reaches. Predators are marked with Floy tags (see method ID: 1443) then recaptured at successive intervals throughout the juvenile outmigration season. The mark and recapture information is then used in a computer program to generate estimates of predator abundance. This method applies to smallmouth bass but can be customized for use with any predator.",
