 1. Keywords: site mapping, relocation, important features, map reconstruction
2. Abstract: The method described involves the creation and use of reach maps to document important features of a site for future relocation purposes. This is crucial as it provides a visual reference that can aid in identifying and locating sites. The necessity of this method lies in its ability to simplify the process of revisiting and recognizing sites, especially when a previously drawn map is available.
3. Description: The text explains the use of reach maps in detail, which are diagrammatic representations used to highlight essential features of a site. These maps are typically found on the back of site sampling sheets. For existing sites, a previously drawn map is usually provided, serving as a reference for creating an updated version.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to facilitate site relocation and documentation by capturing key features in a visual format.
5. Constraints: There are no explicit constraints mentioned in the text; however, the method's success depends on having accurate information about the site's important features and access to any previously drawn maps for reference.
