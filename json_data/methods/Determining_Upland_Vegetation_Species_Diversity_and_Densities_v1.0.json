  "abstractText": "Many SRFB acquired lands contain significant areas of upland habitat that either were acquired in fee title or by easement to protect the downslope portion of the salmon bearing stream, or they were part of a parcel of land having significant riparian and instream habitat and the uplands were acquired as part of the parcel requirements. In either event, health of upland habitat should be maintained or improved where stream and riparian protection is a high priority. Upland areas contribute to erosion, landslides, high runoff and high stream temperatures. These protocols are intended to track forest cover, brush and grasslands species diversity, and density as a measure of their health and changes since the base year when purchased.  delineate major vegetation polygons  evaluate vegetation polygons in the field  establish transect and plot locations ",
