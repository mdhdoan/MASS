Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
Coded wire tags (CWT) have been a valuable tool for marking and tracking salmonids since the 1960s. These magnetized tags contain a 6-digit numerical code that provides information about the spool, agency, brood year, release location, and other fields related to the fish. When a tagged Chinook is recovered, it can be easily assessed using a T-wand or V-reader, and the data associated with the tag can be retrieved from the RMIS database. This method has been instrumental in alleviating the need for external marking of salmonids and has significantly improved the ability to track and analyze their movements and population dynamics.
3. Description:
Coded wire tags (CWT) are a type of marking technique used for salmonids, specifically Chinook salmon, where a magnetized tag is injected into the snout of the fish. The tags have evolved from a 5-color longitudinal banded tag to a binary tag and now a 6-digit numerical code capable of producing numerous specific unique tag codes. Each 6-digit code provides information about the spool from which it was cut, corresponding to agency, brood year, release location, and other fields. When a tagged Chinook is recovered, it can be assessed for a cwt by scanning the dorsal portion of its head using a T-wand or V-reader. The samples are then collected and analyzed in a lab with magnification, and the recovered tags are entered into the RMIS database to retrieve specific data about that spool or batch of fish.
4. Target:
The primary focus of coded wire tags (CWT) is to mark and track salmonids, specifically Chinook salmon, to alleviate external marking and improve the ability to analyze their movements and population dynamics.
5. Constraints:
One constraint for this method is the need for specialized equipment, such as a T-wand or V-reader, to assess the tags. Additionally, there may be limitations in the accuracy and precision of the data retrieved from the RMIS database, depending on factors such as the quality of the samples collected and entered into the system.
