  "abstractText": "The purpose of this method is to describe the spatial and temporal variability in algae blooms on water bodies. It will provide qualitative information on the amount of blue-green algae that is present that could result in elevated toxin levels. Although coarse in its resolution on algae type, it provides a big picture view of an algae bloom.",
