2. Abstract: A streamgage is a device installed near streams or rivers that measures and records water levels, providing critical information for flood prediction and water resource management. The US Geological Survey (USGS) uses onsite measurements to compute streamflow, which is made available online after quality assurance. This method offers accurate and timely data for managing water resources and mitigating the impact of natural disasters like floods.

3. Description: A streamgage is a structure containing equipment that measures and records water levels in streams or rivers, referred to as gage height or stage. The USGS computes streamflow (discharge) from these water levels using a site-specific relation called a stage-discharge rating curve. This curve is developed based on onsite water level and streamflow measurements made by USGS hydrographers. To ensure accuracy, the data undergo quality assurance before being published online. The method's primary focus is to offer precise and up-to-date information on water levels and streamflow, supporting effective management of water resources and natural disaster preparedness.

4. Target: The main goal of this method is to provide accurate water level and streamflow data for water resource management and flood prediction.

5. Constraints: Although the method is efficient in providing data, potential limitations include:
  * Equipment malfunction or damage affecting measurement accuracy
  * Limited spatial coverage due to resource constraints
  * Time lag between onsite measurements and data availability online
