  "abstractText": "Invasive species can have a multitude of effects on native flora and fauna. The presence of invasive species can indicate degraded watershed condition. All sites will be examined for the presence of any invasive species listed in Table 6. Invasive species surveys will occur at three different times (associated with other protocols) at each site and will target different species and their preferred habitats. Incidental occurrences of any non-native plants or animals should be recorded.",
