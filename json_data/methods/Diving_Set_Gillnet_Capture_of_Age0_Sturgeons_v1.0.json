  "abstractText": "Gillnets are a passive sampling gear that can be used in a wide variety of habitats and for both commercial and research fisheries (Hubert 1996). Gillnets can be highly size selective depending on the the size of meshes deployed and effectiveness can change based on the type of material the webbing is constructed of, e.g. single strand mono-filament, multi-strand nylon (Hubert 1996). Diving gillnets can be highly effective at capturing large numbers of sturgeons and other bottom oriented fish in relatively small amounts of time. Because of their nature and widespread use in fisheries training costs are minimal and efforts can be standardized across multiple platforms.",
