2. Abstract: The necessity for identifying hatchery and wild kokanee populations is addressed through the use of thermal mass-marking techniques at the Cabinet Gorge Fish Hatchery since 1997. This method, described by Volk et al. (1990), enables the analysis of kokanee for distinct thermal marks and distinguishing between hatchery and wild components, providing valuable insights for fisheries management.
3. Description: The text describes a specific technique used at the Cabinet Gorge Fish Hatchery to mark kokanee called thermal mass-marking or cold branding. This method was developed by Volk et al. (1990) and has been in use since 1997 for all kokanee produced at the hatchery. The technique involves creating distinct thermal marks on hatchery kokanee, allowing for identification of their origin. These thermal marks are present in kokanee of all ages, making it possible to determine hatchery and wild components in a population. The analysis of kokanee for these marks is an essential tool for fisheries management and conservation efforts.
4. Target: To analyze kokanee and distinguish between hatchery and wild components through the use of distinct thermal marks.
5. Constraints: The primary constraint for this method is the requirement for specialized equipment and expertise to correctly analyze and identify the thermal marks in kokanee, ensuring accurate determination of their origin.
