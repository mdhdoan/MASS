2. Abstract: This method details the implementation of aerial reconnaissance surveys to monitor and identify breeding colonies of piscivorous waterbirds in the Columbia River basin. Using manned aircraft, surveys are conducted early in the breeding season to detect established or incipient colonies. Digital images are taken when birds are observed on suitable nesting substrate, and carefully timed ground- or boat-based surveys are carried out to assess breeding status at potential colony sites. This approach allows for efficient mapping and monitoring of waterbird colonies over a large geographic area.
3. Description: The methodology begins with conducting aerial reconnaissance surveys in the Columbia River basin, focusing on known colonial waterbird colony sites and areas within foraging range that may harbor new breeding colonies. Surveys are carried out using a manned, fixed-wing aircraft, enabling coverage of extensive distances and access to remote locations. Digital SLR cameras with image-stabilizing, zoom lenses capture oblique aerial photographs when piscivorous waterbirds are detected on appropriate nesting substrate. Ground- or boat-based surveys follow when potential breeding colonies are identified in flight or through post-flight image analysis, ensuring accurate assessment of breeding status and nesting chronology at these sites. The resulting dataset includes a list of surveyed sites, their GPS coordinates, and behavioral observations (nesting or loafing), with all active colonies mapped for easy reference.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is the efficient identification, monitoring, and mapping of piscivorous waterbird breeding colonies within the Columbia River basin.
5. Constraints: This method relies on suitable weather conditions for aerial surveys, as well as access permissions for ground- or boat-based follow-up assessments at identified colony sites. Additionally, image quality and visibility during flights can impact the accuracy of piscivorous waterbird detection and subsequent breeding colony verification.
