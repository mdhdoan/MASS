  "abstractText": "This method describes how to measure slope and bearing of the main channel at each site duringa data collection event (DCE). It applies to wadedstreams. This method requires use of a hand level, measuring rod, and a compass to makeincremental measurements across each of at least 20 segments of the stream site.Two persons perform this activity: one rodder who holds a measuring rod in a vertical positionand a sighter who sights on the rodder with a hand level and compass to record data. Crewmembers must be trained prior to performing this method.",
