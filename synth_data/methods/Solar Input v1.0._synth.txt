2. Abstract: The use of solar pathfinder photos is a crucial method for assessing the suitability of a location for solar energy generation. Photos are taken at specific locations along the bankfull channel of a waterway, at regular intervals. This technique allows for an accurate analysis of the potential impact of shading on solar panels throughout the day. To ensure optimal photo quality, it is recommended to take photos at the beginning of the day, before the sun's position creates glare that may affect image clarity.
3. Description: The text outlines a specific procedure for capturing solar pathfinder photos at transect points 1, 6, 11, 16, and 21, which are located along the bankfull channel of a waterway. This process involves taking photos at the beginning of the day to minimize the impact of glare from the sun on photo quality. Solar pathfinder photos serve as valuable tools in determining the ideal placement and orientation of solar panels to maximize energy production while minimizing potential shading issues throughout the day.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to ensure accurate and reliable solar suitability assessments through strategic placement and orientation of solar panels, based on solar pathfinder photos taken at specific transect points along a waterway's bankfull channel.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method include the need for consistent weather conditions, as cloud cover or rain can impact photo quality, and the requirement for accurate transect point placement to ensure reliable data collection. Additionally, time constraints related to taking photos at the beginning of the day may pose challenges in certain situations.
