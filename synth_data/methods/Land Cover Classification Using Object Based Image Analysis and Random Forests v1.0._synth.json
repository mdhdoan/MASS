  "abstract": " This method describes an approach to analyzing high-resolution aerial imagery using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) for land cover classification. OBIA is a more advanced technique compared to traditional pixel-based methods as it allows the incorporation of additional information such as size, shape, and spatial relationships of objects in the analysis, along with ancillary data like elevation and slope.\n\nThe method consists of three main steps:\n1. Image Segmentation: The image is divided into non-overlapping, multi-pixel objects that are relatively homogeneous. These objects ideally correspond to land cover elements such as tree crowns or buildings.\n2. Object Attribute Extraction: Ancillary data like elevation and slope are calculated for each segmented object.\n3. Land Cover Classification: The Random Forests algorithm is used to classify the segments into predetermined land cover classes based on both spectral reflectance information and additional attributes extracted from the image objects.\n\nThis method addresses issues with traditional pixel-based methods by providing more context for each pixel in the form of object attributes and ancillary data, which results in a more accurate representation of the real world. It also allows for the incorporation of advanced techniques such as machine learning algorithms to improve classification accuracy.\n\nAssuming you have already obtained high-resolution aerial imagery, chosen your desired land cover classes, and collected relevant training data, you can perform this analysis using software packages like ORFEO toolbox, QGIS2.x, ArcGIS 10.x, and R.\n\nHere's a simplified pseudo code for the method:\n```python\n# Step 1 - Image Segmentation\nsegments = segment_image(high_resolution_aerial_imagery)\n\n# Step 2 - Object Attribute Extraction\nattributes = extract_attributes(segments, ancillary_data)\n\n# Step 3 - Land Cover Classification\nlandcover_classes = classify_objects(attributes)\n```"

  "description": " This text describes a method for conducting object-based land cover classification using high-resolution remotely sensed imagery. The process begins with image segmentation, which is the foundation of object-based analysis. Segmentation divides an image into non-overlapping, multi-pixel objects that are relatively homogeneous and ideally correspond to elements of interest, such as tree crowns or buildings.\n\nImage segmentation is achieved through techniques such as thresholding, edge detection, or region growing. In this method, the specific approach is not specified. However, it is mentioned that advances in object-based image analysis have provided improvements over traditional pixel-based methods, particularly for high-resolution imagery.\n\nOnce the images are segmented, each object segment is attributed with ancillary spatial data. This includes elevation, slope, and other relevant data that provides context for the classification process. The second major step in the object-based classification process involves calculating and attributing these ancillary data to each object.\n\nAfter image segmentation and attribute calculation, there are several ways to classify the object segments into land cover classes. This method utilizes Random Forests, an ensemble learning method involving multiple decision trees, for the classification task. Random Forest models can be built using R, a popular programming language for statistical computing and graphics, and require user-provided training data to improve their ability to accurately classify image objects.\n\nThe text assumes that users have already acquired high-resolution aerial imagery, determined the type and number of classes they wish to use for land cover classification, and collected any ancillary data relevant for training the classification algorithm. Software packages like ORFEO toolbox, QGIS2.x, ArcGIS 10.x, and R are utilized for image segmentation, attribution, and classification procedures.\n\nHere is a code snippet in R to build a Random Forest model:\n\n```R\nlibrary(randomForest)\n# Assuming 'data' is a dataframe containing the image object features (segment attributes),\n# 'labels' is a vector with land cover class labels, and 'ancillary_data' is a matrix of additional spatial data.\n# Build training set\ntrainIndex <- createDataPartition(labels, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)\ntrainingData <- data[ trainIndex, ]\ntrainingLabels <- labels[ trainIndex ]\n\n# Build Random Forest model\nrfModel <- randomForest(labels ~ ., data = trainingData, mtryStart = 2, mtryEnd = 6, stepFactor = 0.1)\n```\n\nThis code splits the dataset into a training set and builds a Random Forest classifier using the 'randomForest' package in R. The user-provided data should include image object features, labels, and ancillary data for accurate land cover classification."
