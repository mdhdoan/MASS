  "abstractText": "A pool is defined as a depression in the streambed that is laterally and longitudinally concave (i.e., bowl shaped) and characterized by water that is slower and flatter than up- or downstream waters at baseflow. Pools are bound by a head crest (an upstream increase in streambed slope) and a tail (a downstream leveling of the streambed slope and reduction in depth) (Figure 15). The pool tail is the shallowest downstream location in the pool from which water would spill if the flow were reduced to a trickle.",
