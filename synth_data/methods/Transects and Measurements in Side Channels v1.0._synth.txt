2. Abstract: This method outlines guidelines for sampling a reach with a side channel. Side channels are defined as separated bodies of water flowing around an island. The protocol differentiates between major and minor side channels based on the percentage of total flow they contain. Only major side channels with 16-49% of the total flow should be sampled, while minor side channels with less than or equal to 15% should be disregarded. Dry side channels do not meet the flow requirement and should not be recognized in the thalweg profile.
3. Description: This text provides a detailed procedure for sampling a reach with a side channel, which is separated from the main channel by an island. The protocol first establishes a distinction between major and minor side channels based on the amount of total flow they contain. Major side channels are those that contain 16-49% of the total flow, while minor side channels contain less than or equal to 15%. Data should only be collected from the major side channel with the most flow if multiple major side channels are present. Dry side channels should not be sampled and do not factor into the thalweg profile.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to provide guidelines for sampling a reach with a side channel, differentiating between major and minor side channels based on total flow percentage.
5. Constraints: The constraints of this method include the necessity for accurate measurements of total flow in the main channel and each side channel to properly distinguish between major and minor side channels. Additionally, if multiple major side channels are present, determining which has the most flow may require further investigation. Dry side channels cannot be sampled as they do not meet the flow requirement.
