  "background": "Our monitoring project is using this protocol to investigate the potential of using eDNA sampling to estimate population-level allele frequencies in Chinook and steelhead. eDNA sampling is most commonly used for determining presence/absence of various species, but we are attempting to determine overall SNP genotypes and their frequencies at any given sampling site. The ability to estimate allele frequencies from eDNA sampling would allow for genetic sampling even if the stream temperatures are too hot for electrofishing safely, and could also increase the overall sampling coverage by allowing water collections below stream reaches that are inaccessible for whatever reason.",

  "id": 3471,
  "assumptions": "<p>1) eDNA in the water column is shed from a living organism or a recent corpse of the target species or taxonomic group;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) eDNA does not move counter to the flow of water and does not enter the water column from a reservoir in sediments;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) eDNA is not appreciably moved by predators/parasites or derive from anthropogenic sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "The objective of this protocol is to determine the feasibility of generating allele frequency information from eDNA sampling."
