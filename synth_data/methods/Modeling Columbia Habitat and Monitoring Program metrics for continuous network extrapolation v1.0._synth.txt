2. Abstract:
The method discussed in this text focuses on creating spatially continuous estimates of CHaMP metrics using model-based techniques and globally available attributes (GAAs). The goal is to provide a more detailed understanding of the distribution and variability of CHaMP metrics, both within and outside CHaMP watersheds. This approach allows for better habitat management through the generation of maps with continuous estimated responses and enhanced design-based estimates in areas with limited or no sampling data. The methodology relies on selecting statistically informative GAAs as covariates and ensuring GAA coverage across all intended prediction sites, while validating these models using cross-validation at various spatial levels.

3. Description:
The text describes a method for estimating CHaMP metrics continuously along stream networks using model-based techniques that incorporate globally available attributes (GAAs) as covariates. This approach aims to provide spatially continuous estimates, rather than just watershed level distributions, enabling the creation of maps showing estimated responses and augmenting design-based estimates where limited or no sampling data exists.

The methodology emphasizes two main criteria: ensuring GAA coverage across all intended prediction sites (for both numeric and categorical GAA variables) and identifying a subset of GAAs that are statistically informative for the CHaMP metric being validated, with observable relationships between GAAs and CHaMP metrics examined through cross-validation at various spatial levels.

The primary target is to create successful and informative models capable of both predicting CHaMP metrics within CHaMP watersheds and extrapolating CHaMP metrics into non-CHaMP watersheds, providing a more comprehensive understanding of CHaMP metrics distribution and variability for better habitat management.

4. Target:
The primary focus is to create spatially continuous estimates of CHaMP metrics using model-based techniques incorporating globally available attributes as covariates, ensuring GAA coverage and statistical informativeness for improved habitat management.

5. Constraints:
Two main constraints include the need for GAA coverage across all intended prediction sites and the necessity to identify a subset of GAAs that are statistically informative for CHaMP metrics validation. Meeting these criteria requires thorough cross-validation at various spatial levels, ensuring robustness and accuracy in model predictions for both CHaMP and non-CHaMP watersheds.
