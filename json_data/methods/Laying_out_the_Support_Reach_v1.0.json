  "abstractText": "Upon arrival at a stream site, first confirm you are at the correct site. Then determine if the stream meets certain criteria for sampling and data collection activities to occur as described in Method ID 71. Decide whether the stream is unduly influenced by rain events which could affect the representativeness of field data and samples. Certain conditions at the time of the visit may warrant the collection of only a subset of field measurements and samples. Finally, if it is determined that the stream is to be sampled, lay out a defined reach of the stream as described below within which all subsequent sampling and measurement activities are conducted. At each sampling point (X-site location), the response designs for the various indicators must be implemented. Unlike chemistry, which can be measured at a point, the response designs for biological assemblage and physical habitat indicators require sampling a length of a stream to obtain a representative picture of the assemblages and habitat conditions to characterize the sampling point. The length of stream sampled at each sampling point (termed the support reach) represents the integration of the response designs for the individual indicators. Based on several studies (Robison 1998, Li et al. 2001, Reynolds et al. 2003), a support reach with a length of 40 times the average channel width measured near the X-site is established at each X-site.",
