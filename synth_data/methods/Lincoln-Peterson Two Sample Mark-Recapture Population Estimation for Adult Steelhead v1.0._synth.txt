2. Abstract: The necessity to estimate adult steelhead populations for conservation purposes is addressed through a unique life history trait that allows for recapture at the same site during upstream and downstream spawning migrations. A capture-recapture method is employed using a weir-trap at the mouth of a creek for initial capture and a kelt trap in close proximity for recapture. This method enables population estimates and post-spawn survival estimates, contributing to effective steelhead management.
3. Description: The text describes a method used for estimating adult steelhead populations through a process called capture-recapture. Steelhead are unique in that they do not always die after spawning, allowing for the possibility of capturing and recapturing fish on their upstream and downstream migrations respectively. A weir-trap (Method ID: 145) is used to capture upstream migrating steelhead near the mouth of a creek, while a kelt trap (Method ID: 5450) serves as the recapture collection point in close proximity to the initial capture point. This method allows for population estimates and post-spawn survival estimates to be derived for each creek, contributing to effective steelhead management and conservation efforts.
4. Target: Steelhead adult population estimation and post-spawn survival rates.
5. Constraints: The success of this method depends on several factors including the availability and accessibility of suitable capture and recapture sites, the timing and placement of traps, and the behavior and migration patterns of steelhead in relation to these traps. Additionally, environmental variables such as water levels and weather conditions may impact trap efficiency and overall method success.
