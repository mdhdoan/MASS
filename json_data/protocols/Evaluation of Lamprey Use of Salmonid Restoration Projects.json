  "background": "In the Upper Columbia region numerous salmonid-focused habitat restoration projects have been implemented in the past decade to address habitat limiting factors and improve the survival of ESA-listed salmonids. Pacific lamprey are present in many of these project areas, but little information exists to determine whether or not these salmonid-focused projects are benefitting lamprey through the creation/enhancement of larval rearing habitat and its use by larval lamprey.By examining the development of larval rearing habitat at salmonid-focused projects that were implemented to address identified limiting factors (threats), we can determine if these types of projects will have the added benefit of providing lamprey rearing habitat and observe if lamprey are indeed occupying this created/enhanced habitat.",

    "Quantify the area and condition of Type 1 lamprey rearing habitat present (as per Close 2000) at a suite of historic salmonid-focused habitat restoration projects in the Methow and Entiat Subbasins.\t",
    "Quantify the presence and biomass of larval lamprey in available Type 1 habitat present at sampled salmonid-focused habitat restoration projects (see attached field data sheet). ",
    "Assess salmonid-focused project types and features that promote development of Type 1 larval rearing habitat."
