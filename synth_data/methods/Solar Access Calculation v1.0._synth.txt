2. Abstract: This method describes a technique to measure the available solar radiation at a site using solar access. A Solar Pathfinder device is used to capture images at specific transects and calculate monthly solar access values. The average of July, August, and September's solar access values provides an overall assessment of the site's solar potential.
3. Description: Solar access is a measure of the solar radiation available at a site, obtained by summing the solar radiation across all days in a month. To determine the monthly solar access values, images are captured at the center of the wetted channel at all odd-numbered transects (1, 3, 5, 7, and 21) using a Solar Pathfinder device. The data collected from these images is then used to calculate the solar access for each month. The average of the solar access values in July, August, and September is reported as the overall solar potential of the site.
4. Target: To assess the solar radiation potential at a specific site by calculating monthly solar access values.
5. Constraints: The method relies on using a Solar Pathfinder device and capturing images at specific transects (odd-numbered only). Additionally, the calculation of monthly solar access values requires accurate data collection and analysis. The selection of the months for averaging (July, August, and September) may not be applicable in regions with different climates or seasons.
