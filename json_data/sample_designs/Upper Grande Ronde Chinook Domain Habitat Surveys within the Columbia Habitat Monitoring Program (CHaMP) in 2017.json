  "description": "<p>CHaMP&nbsp;is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010).&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;salmonids&nbsp;and/or their habitat. The implementation of&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;56.3,&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;57, and&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;3.&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel (see section 1.6), at least 9 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The target populations are the Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;Chinook, Catherine Creek Chinook, and Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;Steelhead.&nbsp; Three study designs were generated to meet the sampling needs of each population.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2011 Design Notes:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ChaMP&rsquo;s&nbsp; Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;habitat monitoring program covers three distinct spatial domains, coordinating&nbsp;CHaMP,&nbsp;ODFW, and&nbsp;CRITFC&nbsp;habitat monitoring goals and interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;CRITFC&nbsp;coordinated the sampling for the Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&rsquo;s&nbsp;and Catherine Creek Chinook spawning and rearing habitat. The sampling domain for&nbsp;ODFW&nbsp; (also&nbsp;CHaMP) covers the steelhead spawning and rearing domain, part of which overlaps the Chinook spawning area in both Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;and Catherine Creek.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2011 Design summary</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Survey designs were created for each of the three major domains: Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;and Catherine Creek&nbsp;chinook&nbsp;spawning and rearing domains and steelhead alone domain (i.e., the portion of the Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;steelhead domain that did not overlap with the Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;and Catherine Creek domains).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Design Strata:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;Steelhead Domain: Valley Class (Source/Transport/Depositional) + Ownership (public/private)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;Chinook and Catherine Creek: No stratification</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Legacy sites:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;and Catherine Creek Designs:&nbsp;&nbsp;CRTFC&nbsp;surveyed the Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;during 2010 using a&nbsp;GRTS&nbsp;design and a frame that&nbsp;CRTFC&nbsp;developed. &nbsp;These legacy sites were transferred to the 1:100 scale network used to develop the&nbsp;CBW&nbsp;master sample. Fifteen sites were targeted each year in each domain, 10 annual and 5 each year on a three year rotation. As we discussed the Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;portion of the study, the target frame was reduced significantly because there were substantial private lands preventing sampling access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Detailed Design Notes File: CRITFC.ODFW design goals.docx contains the discussion about developing both 2011 and 2012 designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2012 Design Notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. The target population was&nbsp;expanded to include additional Chinook spawning areas in Beaver Creek, a tributary to the Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;River. This stream is known to provide habitat for spawning and rearing Chinook salmon, but was excluded from the original sample frame due to access issues with the landowner. Access remains tentative, but it would be beneficial to survey sites in Beaver Creek on an opportunistic basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. The target population will be expanded to include non-natal rearing habitat for Chinook, including portions of the&nbsp;mainstem&nbsp;upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;River between Beaver Creek and Five Points Creek and portions of various tributaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;CHaMP&rsquo;s&nbsp;panel sample sizes changed from 10 annual sites to 5; rotating panels 2 and 3 increased to 10 sites each.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2012 Design changes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;Chinook:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brief recap of the redesign goal for 2012:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0.5in\">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand the&nbsp;UGR&nbsp;chinook&nbsp;sampling domain</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0.5in\">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce original annual panel from 10 to 5 sites; assign the released annual sites to beef up rotating panels 2 and 3 to 10 sites each and distribute these 10 sites across the original&nbsp;UGR&nbsp;chinook&nbsp;domain and the expansion domain.&nbsp; Assign the 5 dropped annual sites to rotating panel 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0.5in\">Design layout treats the original 2011 and expanded domains as separate strata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The allocation of number of RP 2 and 3 sites followed the desire to allocate the 10 sites in each panel without regard to stratification even though we found it necessary to stratify.&nbsp; We chose an allocation of 3 per panel in the original domain and 7 in the expansion domain.&nbsp; This follows the relative extent in each domain with one twist.&nbsp; Beaver Cr. was considered part of the original domain, but sites were deemed &ldquo;access denied&rdquo; so was excluded from the design.&nbsp; However, there is interest in having some sites fall in Beaver Cr.&nbsp; We incorporated Beaver Cr. into the expansion domain.&nbsp; There are 34 master sample sites in the original domain, 10 in Beaver Cr., and 61 in the expansion domain; total = 105 sites.&nbsp; The original domain is about 1/3 and the expansion + Beaver Cr about 2/3.&nbsp; The allocation we chose approximates this ratio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Original domain:&nbsp; Keep the original design intact.&nbsp; For&nbsp;RP2&nbsp;and&nbsp;RP3, select the first 3 sites in the original 2011&nbsp;RP2&nbsp;and&nbsp;RP3&nbsp;set; assign the remainder to the &lsquo;over&rsquo; or &lsquo;extra&rsquo; pool.&nbsp; As indicated above, assign the five &lsquo;released&rsquo; annual sites to&nbsp;RP1&nbsp;pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expanded domain:&nbsp; We&nbsp;rerandomized&nbsp;the expanded domain plus Beaver Cr. sites (71 sites total) to generate a spatially ordered balance within this stratum.&nbsp; Blocks of sites (16 sites per block)&nbsp; were examined for spatial balance with respect to both panels and &lsquo;fit&rsquo; to the&nbsp;ODFW&nbsp;legacy sites (sampled in 2011 or planned for 2012 and 2013).&nbsp; The second block (site #17 in the ordered list)&nbsp; was selected for sample allocation, and &nbsp;sites were alternately assigned to&nbsp;RP2&nbsp;and&nbsp;RP3.&nbsp;&nbsp; No legacy sites were incorporated into the selection in the expansion domain.&nbsp; It is possible that some sites will fall &ldquo;too close&rdquo; to legacy sites (1 km criterion?), or that Beaver Cr. sites will be access denied.&nbsp; Replace denied sites with the next on the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strata updates for 2013: There were no changes to the Steelhead nor Chinook sampling designs in 2013. &nbsp;However, sampling by the Confederated Tribes of the&nbsp;Umatilla&nbsp;added several sites to cm.org to make sampling possible. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strata updates for 2012:</strong>&nbsp;Expanded&nbsp;UGR&nbsp;domain treated as an additional stratum called Upper Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;Chinook Expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GRTS&nbsp;Master Sample Input file:</strong>&nbsp;UGRr_chinook_domain_MS_legacy_coded_20120403.csv</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200b<strong>R code</strong>: UGR.r, used strat_panel_function10.2.r</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Output file:&nbsp;</strong>ugr_new_1_20120605.csv</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2013 Design Updates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were minimal changes to the Grande&nbsp;Ronde&nbsp;design in 2013. &nbsp;Minor changes included the addition of a stratum to add 3 sites for sampling by the Confederated Tribes of the&nbsp;Umatilla&nbsp;Indian Reservation (CTUIR) and a shift of site&nbsp;CBW-360346&nbsp;to the annual panel to also facilitate sampling by&nbsp;CTUIR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2014 Design updates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There</strong>\u200b were no updates to the study design, target frame, or site selection in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2015 Design updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were no changes to the design in 2015 and the 2014 file will be referenced in champmonitoring.org</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2016&nbsp;Design updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were no changes to the design in 2015 and the 2014 file will be referenced in champmonitoring.org</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2017 Design updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>6/26/17: &nbsp;AEM will be sampling site CBW-031546 in 2017. &nbsp;This site was moved from RP3 Upper Grande Ronde&nbsp;Chinook (Use order 1) to Annual-AEM Upper Grande Ronde Chinook block (new), Use Order 1. &nbsp;This site should be refiled to RP3&nbsp;at the end of 2017 unless AEM&nbsp;plans to sample it in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Design Documentation Files:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>No new design files&nbsp;</strong><strong>were generated for 2013--changes to accommodate&nbsp;CTUIR&nbsp;sampling were made directly in&nbsp;champmonitoring&nbsp;desig</strong><strong>n documentation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2012 redesign:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>GrandeRondeDesignDocs2012.zip&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>https://isemp.egnyte.com/h-s/20140130/cb95af9246ff4a4d</div>\r\n",
