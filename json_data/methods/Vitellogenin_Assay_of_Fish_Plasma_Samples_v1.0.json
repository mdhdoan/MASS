  "abstractText": "Oocyte development in female fishes is divided into primary and secondary growth (Nagahama et al., 1995). The oocytes grow most dramatically during the secondary growth stage (Bromage and Cumaranatunga 1988). Within the secondary growth stage, most growth occurs during the so-called exogenous vitellogenesis stage. During this stage, 17-estradiol stimulates liver synthesis of the egg precursor phospholipoprotein vitellogenin, which circulatesviathe blood and is taken in the developing ovaries to fuel oocyte growth (Sumpter et al., 1984). During exogenous vitellogenesis, oocytes take up liver derived vitellogenin which is processed and stored as yolk (Bromage and Cumaranatunga 1988). Due to the close association of plasma vitellogenin with oocyte development, plasma levels of vitellogenin can be used to assess development of the ovary during exogenous vitellogenesis.",
