2. Abstract: Thermal marking of bony structures is a critical method for identifying project origin adults in salmon enhancement and reintroduction programs. This technique is necessary because traditional marking methods used for other salmonids are not feasible for small fry. By applying a schedule of thermal changes during incubation, a unique and recognizable bar code-like mark can be created on the bony structures of the salmon fry without causing additional stress or impact.

3. Description: The text describes a method for marking chum salmon fry called thermal marking of boney structures. This technique is used because traditional methods such as Carlson-type wire tags (CWT), passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, fin clips or maxillary clips are not possible due to the small size of the fry at emigration. While it is possible to apply fin or maxillary clips if the fry are reared to a larger size, these methods carry additional stresses, risks and costs. The method described in the text uses thermal changes during incubation to mark the bony structures of the salmon fry with a unique and recognizable pattern. This technique is non-invasive, has no impact on the fry, and can be done while the eggs/fry are still in the incubation trays.

4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide a non-invasive, cost-effective and unique identification method for chum salmon fry that can be used for monitoring and evaluating enhancement/reintroduction programs.

5. Constraints: This method has the following constraints:
	* It can only be applied during incubation period of salmon fry.
	* It is limited to identifying project origin adults, not juveniles or sub-adults.
	* The technique may not work if the thermal conditions are not controlled properly during incubation.
