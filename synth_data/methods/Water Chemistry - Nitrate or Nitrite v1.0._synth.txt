2. Abstract: The Columbia River Basin is facing a significant decline in anadromous salmonid populations over the past 30 years, with several of them now protected under the ESA. To address this concern, a comprehensive and reliable monitoring strategy needs to be implemented, focusing on water quality attributes such as temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorous. The method calls for continuous monitoring at integrator sites, located downstream of each population or subpopulation, with seasonal measurements achieved through monthly grab samples. This approach aims to reduce uncertainties surrounding the declines and support recovery planning efforts by providing high-quality data for ESA assessments.
3. Description: The text presents a detailed method for monitoring anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin, focusing on water quality attributes essential for their survival. Seven key attributes have been identified based on the recommendations from the UCMS (Hillman 2006). Continuous monitoring of these attributes is carried out at integrator sites downstream of each population or subpopulation using instruments that meet Data Quality Level A standards. Co-locating water quality monitoring stations with associated flow gauges enables investigators to assess the impact of stream flow on water quality attributes, providing critical insights into the factors influencing salmonid populations. The method requires data collection at multiple spatial scales as required by the ESA for species and habitat assessments. Monthly grab samples are collected seasonally for nitrogen and phosphorous measurements, further enhancing the comprehensiveness of the monitoring strategy.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to develop a reliable and comprehensive water quality monitoring strategy for anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin to aid in their recovery and support ESA assessment requirements.
5. Constraints: The success of this monitoring method depends on the availability of resources, including funding, personnel, and technology required to maintain continuous monitoring and collect high-quality data at integrator sites. Additionally, coordination between various agencies responsible for managing water quality monitoring stations and flow gauges is crucial to ensure consistent and accurate data collection across the Columbia River Basin.
