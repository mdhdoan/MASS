  "abstract": " This document describes a standardized approach for collecting habitat variable data throughout the Columbia Basin Region to support the Columbia River Wildlife Mitigation Program funded by Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The publication serves as a manual for Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) and Combined Habitat Assessment Protocols (CHAP) techniques used by the Regional HEP Team. By providing a consistent method, the document aims to ensure accurate and reliable data collection for wildlife mitigation efforts.\n\nThe document is user-friendly and intended for both novice and experienced field technicians, keeping theoretical and mathematical/statistical discussions to a minimum. It assumes that technicians possess the necessary measuring devices but provides limited descriptions in most cases. English measurements (inches, feet, etc.) are used for ease of understanding by the general public and can be easily converted to metric equivalents if needed.\n\nThe necessity of this standardized approach lies in ensuring consistent data collection throughout the Columbia Basin Region, which is crucial for effective wildlife mitigation efforts. By using a common language, methodology, and measurement system, data collected from different sites can be compared and analyzed more effectively. Additionally, this approach helps minimize errors and inconsistencies that might arise due to varying techniques used by different technicians or teams.\n\nOverall, this document provides a critical foundation for consistent and accurate habitat variable data collection in support of the Columbia River Wildlife Mitigation Program, ensuring effective and efficient wildlife mitigation efforts throughout the region."
