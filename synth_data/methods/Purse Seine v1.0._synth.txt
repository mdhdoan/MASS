2. Abstract: Purse Seine fishing is a method used in marine and freshwater environments to catch fish. It involves the use of a purse seine net, which is designed to encircle and impound fish rather than entangle them, making it ideal for catch-and-release activities and selective harvest programs. The net is configured to hang vertically in the water with the bottom weighted by a leadline and the top buoyed by a cork line. Chafing gear can be added to the net to minimize damage when fishing in areas where the net may come into contact with submerged obstructions. This method allows for careful selection of fish, minimizing unwanted mortality, and is particularly useful for catching adult summer/fall Chinook salmon for broodstock collection.
3. Description: Purse Seine fishing is a method that utilizes a seine boat, skiff, and purse seine net to catch fish in open-water marine environments or freshwater bodies without submerged obstructions. The purse seine net is designed to impound fish rather than entangle them, making it suitable for selective harvest programs where minimizing mortality of sampled or non-target fish is crucial. The length and depth of the net are determined by the physical dimensions of specific fishing areas and their bathymetry. Mesh size is chosen to reduce the number of fish wedged or gilled in the net. Chafing gear, a narrow strip of mesh attached near the bottom edge of the net, can be added to minimize damage when the net comes into contact with submerged obstructions. The process of setting the net involves holding the bag end stationary while the seiner deploys it in a U-shaped configuration, then towing it evenly from both ends in a horseshoe shape until closed. Care must be taken to avoid overloading the net and causing unwanted fish mortality. Once the net is closed, fish can be sorted by species, size, sex, or origin, with natural-origin and hatchery-origin summer/fall Chinook adults selected for broodstock collection.
4. Target: The primary focus of Purse Seine fishing is to effectively catch fish in open-water environments while minimizing unwanted mortality, allowing for careful selection of fish during the sorting process.
5. Constraints: Factors such as submerged obstructions, net size and configuration, and judgment in determining set duration can impact the effectiveness and sustainability of Purse Seine fishing. Overloading the net or pulling too long may result in unwanted fish mortality, and careful consideration should be given to replacing the net with mesh of a different size if too many fish are gilled or wedged during retrieval.
