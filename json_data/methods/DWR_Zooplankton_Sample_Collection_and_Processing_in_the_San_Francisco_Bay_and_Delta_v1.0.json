  "abstractText": "Zooplankton play a key role in pelagic food webs. Understanding the distribution of zooplankton species enables assessment offood resources available to fish. These zooplankton support theDelta Smelt an endangered fish endemic to the upper San Francisco Estuary as well as other important fish, including Longfin Smelt, Striped Bass, and juvenile Chinook Salmon. Understanding these trophic interactions is central to better management of these species. This method covers the approach for sample collection and processing used by theDepartment of Water Resources (DWR) Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP).",
