2. Abstract: This text describes the methods used in a lab to genotype Oncorhynchus mykiss (steelhead and rainbow trout) using 13-15 microsatellite loci. These loci, 13 of which have been standardized among several labs as the SPAN loci, are useful for inferring population genetic relationships among groups of conspecific organisms. The lab's work has contributed to creating a Columbia River Basin genetic baseline for these fish populations.
3. Description: The text outlines the methods used in a lab to genotype Oncorhynchus mykiss (steelhead and rainbow trout) using 13-15 microsatellite loci, with 13 of these loci being standardized among several labs as the SPAN loci. These markers are short, tandem repeats of 2-6 basepairs in length, and many are evolutionarily neutral, making them useful for inferring population genetic relationships among groups of conspecific organisms. The lab's work has resulted in a Columbia River Basin genetic baseline for these fish populations using these markers.
4. Target: The primary focus of the method is to describe the lab's methods for genotyping Oncorhynchus mykiss with 13-15 microsatellite loci, and to establish a Columbia River Basin genetic baseline for these fish populations using these markers.
5. Constraints: The constraints of this method include the need for specialized lab equipment and expertise in genotyping techniques. Additionally, the success of the method relies on the availability of suitable microsatellite loci for the target organism and the quality of the genetic data obtained.
