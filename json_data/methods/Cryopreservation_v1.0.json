  "abstractText": "The gamete preservation project seeks to apply cryogenic technology to preserve male germplasm from spring and summer Chinook salmon and summer steelhead conservation units that are at low levels of abundance and high risk of extirpation.  Spring and summer Chinook salmon will be sampled from July 1st through October 15th and summer steelhead will be sampled from February 15th through June 30th.  Fall Chinook salmon collections may be instituted in the future at broodstock collection facilities and would occur from October 1st through December 15th.  This approach seeks to preserve and maintain genetic diversity for ongoing artificial propagation programs, both conventional and captive broodstock, and to preserve genetic diversity from selected wild populations as an insurance policy against population collapse and extirpation.",
