 1. Keywords: retrospective simulation, Columbia River plume, simulation databases, salmon metrics, Virtual Columbia River.

2. Abstract: This method utilizes the power of retrospective simulation to better understand the behavior of the Columbia River plume over multiple years. By storing the results in simulation databases, researchers can analyze and compute relevant metrics that characterize ocean entry conditions for salmon. The modeling system, Virtual Columbia River, is maintained at the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) and plays a crucial role in this process.

3. Description: This method involves conducting retrospective simulations of the Columbia River plume over multiple years. These simulations are carried out within the Virtual Columbia River modeling system, which is maintained at the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). The results of these simulations are stored in simulation databases and used to compute metrics relevant to salmon, such as plume volumes, which help characterize ocean entry conditions. This method allows researchers to analyze and understand the behavior of the Columbia River plume over time and its impact on salmon populations.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to better understand the behavior of the Columbia River plume and its impact on salmon populations by conducting retrospective simulations and analyzing relevant metrics.

5. Constraints: Some potential constraints for this method include limitations in data accuracy, computational resources required to run the simulations, and uncertainties related to modeling complex natural systems. Additionally, there may be limitations in the availability or quality of data on salmon populations and their ocean entry conditions.
