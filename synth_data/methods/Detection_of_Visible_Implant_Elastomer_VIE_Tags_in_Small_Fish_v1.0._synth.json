  "abstract": " The Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE) tagging method is a modern technique used for marking and identifying fish. This non-lethal approach uses a two-component biologically inert silicone polymer that can be easily detected without harming the fish or removing their fins. Traditional methods like fin clipping have limitations, such as a limited number of fins, fin regeneration, and mortality caused by fin removal. VIE tags, on the other hand, are appropriate for small-bodied fish (25-40 mm) and juveniles, where other tagging methods like PIT, Floy, or Carlin may not be feasible due to fish size or requiring the death of the fish for visual identification.\n\nThe VIE tags are injected as a liquid that soon cures into a pliable, biocompatible solid. The tags are then implanted beneath transparent or translucent tissue and remain externally visible. However, they may become difficult to detect in ambient light if growth is considerable and pigmented tissue is laid down over the tag. To enhance detection, some of the colored pigments used are fluorescent, making them easily visible when exposed to appropriate lighting. Overall, VIE tagging offers an effective solution for marking small-bodied fish and juveniles while avoiding the issues associated with traditional fin clipping methods.\n\nNo code is generated as this question does not involve writing any code."

  "description": " The Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE) tag is a two-component biologically inert silicone polymer used for fish tagging that exhibits promising detection rates for certain fish species such as bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus), coho salmon smolts (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and various trout (Dewey and Zigler 1996, Bailey et al. 1998, Hale and Gray 1998). This tagging technique is advantageous as it circumvents problems associated with fin clipping, including the limited number of fins, regeneration of fins, and mortality caused by fin removal (Close and Jones 2002). VIE tags are considered non-lethal and effective for identifying small-bodied fish and juveniles, measuring between 25-40 mm (Leblanc and Noakes 2012).\n\nVIE tags consist of a liquid that cures into a pliable, biocompatible solid upon injection. They are implanted beneath transparent or translucent tissue, remaining externally visible once set (Northwest Marine Technology Inc. 2008). These tags can become challenging to detect in ambient light when growth is considerable and pigmented tissue covers the tag. However, some of the colored pigments used in VIE tags are fluorescent, allowing for enhanced detection using appropriate lighting (Leblanc and Noakes 2012).\n\nVIE tagging avoids the limitations of other fish tagging methods like Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT), Floy, and Carlin tags, which have size restrictions or require lethal procedures for visual identification (Leblanc and Noakes 2012). The VIE tag provides a reliable alternative for tracking and monitoring small-bodied fish and juveniles in their natural environments."

  "constraints": " Based on the provided text, here are the constraints applicable to VIE (Visible Implant Elastomer) tagging method and the references where they are mentioned:\n\n1. Size-limited for some tagging methods: \"Most tagging (PIT, Floy, Carlin) is limited by fish size, fish smaller than 40 mm are too small or require the death of the fish for visual identification\" (Leblanc and Noakes 2012).\n2. Non-lethal: \"VIE tags are injected as a liquid that soon cures into a pliable, biocompatible solid. The tags are implanted beneath transparent or translucent tissue and remain externally visible. VIE tags have shown to be non-lethal and effective in the identification of small-bodied (25-40 mm) fish and juveniles\" (Leblanc and Noakes 2012).\n3. Tagging issues with fin clipping: \"VIE tagging is an appropriate mass marking technique that avoids the issues that arise from fin clipping like the limited number of fins, fin regeneration, and mortality caused by fin removal\" (Close and Jones 2002).\n4. Difficulty in detecting tags with growth: \"Tags may become difficult to detect in ambient light if growth is considerable and pigmented tissue is laid down over the tag\" (Northwest Marine Technology Inc. 2008). However, this issue can be mitigated by using appropriate lighting as some of the colored pigments used are fluorescent.\n\nNo code is required for this answer as it is an explanation of constraints based on the text provided."
