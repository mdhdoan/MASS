2. Abstract: This method describes the short-term prediction of circulation in the Columbia River plume, which can be used to optimize fisheries cruises and predict ocean entry conditions for barged or hatchery-released smolts. The Virtual Columbia River, a modeling system maintained at OHSU, is utilized to conduct simulations and generate these forecasts.
3. Description: The text discusses the use of short-term predictions of circulation in the Columbia River plume. These predictions can be used to guide fisheries cruises by providing advanced knowledge of plume front locations, as well as to predict ocean entry conditions for barged or lower-estuary hatchery-released smolts. The simulations are carried out within a modeling system called the Virtual Columbia River, which is maintained at OHSU.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to improve the efficiency of fisheries cruises and predict ocean entry conditions for smolts through short-term circulation forecasts in the Columbia River plume.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method are the availability and accuracy of data used as input for the simulations, as well as the limitations of the Virtual Columbia River modeling system. Additionally, the predictions are only accurate for a short period (hours or days ahead).
