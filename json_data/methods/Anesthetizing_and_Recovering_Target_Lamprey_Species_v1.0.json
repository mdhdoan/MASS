  "abstractText": "Modified from Kinzer et al. (Method 6633)The process to anesthetize lamprey species with Finquel MS-222 after being collected (e.g. rotary screw traps, beach seines, or electrofishing) is explained below. Stock MS-222 and sodium bicarbonate (controls the pH level) solutions are pre-mixed prior to capturing fish. Once fish are captured, the stock solutions are mixed with stream water to create the anesthetic bath.",
