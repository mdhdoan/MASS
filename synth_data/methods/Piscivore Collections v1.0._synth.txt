2. Abstract: Electrofishing is a method used for sampling fish populations in shallow waters. This technique involves the use of an electrofishing boat operated by certified personnel and experienced staff. The method follows the guidelines established by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for pulsed direct current (DC) at 60 pulses per second, 40% power, and a low voltage range. The objective is to minimize harm to fish while effectively capturing them for study. This method has been found to be efficient and safe for fish in the McNary Pool, with power output adjusted to the minimum amperes required for fish narcosis.
3. Description: Electrofishing involves the use of a certified operator and experienced staff to sample fish along the shoreline (less than 2.0 m deep) using an electrofishing boat. The method follows NMFS guidelines, with settings pulsed direct current (DC) at 60 pulses per second, 40% power, and a low voltage range (50-500 V). McMichael's study in the McNary Pool found that the most efficient and fish safe electrofisher power output was between 2-4 amperes. The output will be adjusted to the minimum amperes required for fish narcosis, which is achieved when the effective sampling depth is about 2 meters. Sampling occurs at night to maximize the effectiveness of the method.
4. Target: To safely and efficiently sample fish populations in shallow waters using electrofishing techniques within NMFS guidelines.
5. Constraints: The primary constraint for this method is ensuring that the power output is adjusted to the minimum amperes required for fish narcosis, as higher power output may harm the fish. Additionally, sampling occurs at night and only in waters less than 2 meters deep, which limits the scope of applicability. Compliance with NMFS guidelines is also a constraint that must be followed closely.
