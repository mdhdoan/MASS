 1. Keywords: cyanotoxin quantification, fish tissue, analytical method
   
2. Abstract: This method is crucial for measuring the amount of cyanotoxins in fish tissue. Cyanotoxins pose a health risk to humans who consume affected fish, making it essential to have accurate and reliable quantification methods. The described method provides a solution for determining cyanotoxin levels in fish tissue, ensuring safer seafood products and safeguarding public health.

3. Description: The given text body discusses a specific analytical method used to quantify cyanotoxins in fish tissue. Cyanotoxins are harmful substances produced by certain types of blue-green algae, which can accumulate in fish tissues and pose health risks to humans if consumed. Accurate measurement of these toxins is necessary for ensuring the safety of seafood products and protecting public health. The method described involves analyzing fish tissue samples to determine cyanotoxin levels, providing essential information for risk assessment and management.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to quantify cyanotoxins in fish tissue, enabling accurate risk assessment and ensuring safer seafood products.

5. Constraints: It can be assumed that the method has some constraints or limitations, such as potential interference from other substances in the fish tissue, the need for specialized laboratory equipment, and the requirement for trained personnel to perform the analysis. However, these constraints are not specified in the provided text body.
