  "abstractText": "Setlines are a passive fishing gear that consists of a main line with baited hooks placed along it at regular intervals (Hubert 1996) . Setlines are usually set on the river, reservoir, or lake bottom and weighted at each end with anchors. Setline configurations, which include line length, line type, gangion leader length, hook size, hook type, gangion clip type and size and bait, are dependent on the study objectives.",
