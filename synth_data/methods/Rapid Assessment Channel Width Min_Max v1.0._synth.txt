 Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize and organize the information presented in the text. Here are the five keywords that I think are most relevant to the method described:

1. Channel width
2. Wetted width
3. Bank-full width
4. Riverine habitat
5. Field measurements

Now, let's move on to the rest of your request:

2. Abstract:
This method describes a process for measuring and calculating channel width in rivers and streams as a way to estimate available riverine habitat. By measuring the average wetted width during peak and low flow months, researchers can calculate the typical quantity of habitat available for aquatic species. This information is critical for rapid assessments of river health and can help inform conservation and management efforts. Field measurements of channel width are taken in locations that represent the average for the reach, with consideration given to complex features such as braided channels, off-channel habitat, mid-channel bars, and floodplains.
3. Description:
The text outlines a method for measuring channel width in rivers and streams, with a focus on the importance of accounting for variations in width during peak and low flow months. Wetted width is measured in the field to the nearest 0.1 ft and is used to estimate the quantity of wetted area available for riverine species. The method emphasizes the need to take measurements in locations that represent the average for the reach, particularly in areas with complex features such as braided channels, off-channel habitat, mid-channel bars, and floodplains. The ultimate goal is to provide a detailed picture of the typical width of the channel during each month, which can be used to calculate the typical quantity of habitat available for aquatic species.
4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to provide a standardized approach for measuring and calculating channel width in rivers and streams as a way to estimate available riverine habitat.
5. Constraints:
There are several constraints to this method, including the need for accurate field measurements, the challenge of accounting for complex features such as braided channels and floodplains, and the potential for variability in width measurements due to changes in flow rate and other environmental factors. Additionally, the method requires a solid understanding of river ecology and hydrology to ensure that measurements are taken in appropriate locations and at appropriate times.
