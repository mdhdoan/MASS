  "abstractText": "Fin rays or spines are popular structures for age estimation, particularly for fish lacking scales or when other structures (including otoliths; Walsh et al. 2008) are not reliable.These structures have the added benefit of not requiring sacrifice of fish. Collection of fin rays and spines is usually conducted in the field and requires little time. The first and second dorsal or anal spine is typically collected from spiny-rayed fishes for aging whereas the leading pectoral or pelvic fin ray is typically used for aging soft-rayed fishes. The dorsal spine (typically from second dorsal fin) is often used to estimate age of squalid sharks (McFarlane and Beamish 1987; Irvine et al.2006).",
