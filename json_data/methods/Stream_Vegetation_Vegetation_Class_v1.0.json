  "abstractText": "Knowing the vegetation status at the time of the survey allows biologists tointerpret the history of land use and estimate the potential for recruitment oflarge woody debris into the stream. Some habitat projects help re-establishvegetative cover.Riparian vegetation is a key component of fish habitat. A healthy riparian canopy shadesthe stream channel, in many cases reducing high summer water temperatures. Healthyriparian vegetation stabilizes stream banks with the reinforcing action of interconnectingroot systems. Stabilized stream banks are more likely to develop bank undercut, whichprovides important cover for fish. Stabilized stream banks are less likely to provide finesediments, which can embed spawning gravels and, in extreme cases, fill in pools.Riparian trees also provide the majority of large woody debris (LWD) recruitment into thestream.",
