 1. Abstract: This text outlines a protocol for conducting creel surveys at the Duck Valley Indian Reservation's fisheries to estimate the satisfaction and exploitation rates of tribal and non-tribal anglers. The survey aims to gather accurate data on the number of fish caught, kept, or released, as well as angler experiences and feedback on facilities. This information will help DV Fisheries Managers make informed decisions regarding fishery management and potential improvements to campground facilities.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: The value of this protocol lies in its ability to provide accurate data for effective fishery management, contributing to the preservation of the reservoirs as a vital resource for both tribal and non-tribal members. The problem statement involves the need to monitor fishery health and angler satisfaction to ensure sustainable use of resources. Desired outcomes include improved fishery management decisions, increased angler satisfaction, and better campground facilities based on informed improvements.
3. Description: This text details a creel survey protocol for estimating angler satisfaction and exploitation rates in the Duck Valley Reservoir fisheries. The surveys will rely on assumptions of honesty in reporting and fairness about experiences, as well as the random sampling of anglers. Data gathered from these surveys will help DV Fisheries Managers understand facility usage, angler satisfaction, and the health of the reservoirs' fish populations.
4. Objectives: The main objective is to conduct creel surveys to gather data on angler satisfaction and exploitation rates at the Duck Valley Reservoir fisheries. This objective covers the entire problem statement by providing a solution for monitoring and managing the reservoirs' resources while addressing concerns about angler satisfaction and facility usage. Keywords include: creel surveys, angler satisfaction, exploitation rates, and DV Fisheries Managers.
5. Target: The primary focus of this protocol is to conduct creel surveys at the Duck Valley Indian Reservation's fisheries for effective management and improvement.
6. Constraints: Potential constraints include ensuring a truly random sample of anglers, maintaining honesty in self-reported data, and accurately interpreting angler feedback on facilities.
