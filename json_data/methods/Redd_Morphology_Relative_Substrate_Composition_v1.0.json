  "abstractText": "In spawning areas where various salmonid species overlap in spawn timing, composition of substrate and other characteristics of redds can assist with distinguishing which species and/or life histories (resident, fluvial, or anadromous) constructed the observed redds. Substrate composition may inversely influence redd size. Burner (1951) reported that the redd size in two streams supporting populations of spring Chinook salmon were different and the stream containing a higher proportion of larger football sized substrate producing smaller redds. Additionally, the substrate composition within and in the vicinities of constructed redds could be measured to evaluate if preferred spawning habitat differs among hatchery and natural-origin fish.",
