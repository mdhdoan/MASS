  "abstractText": "Many SRFB acquired lands contain significant areas of intertidal habitat that either were acquired in fee title or by easement to protect the marine portion of the estuary where juvenile salmon reside. These protocols are intended to track marine vegetation in the form of marine algae and rooted vascular plants in terms of species diversity, and density as a measure of their health and changes since the base year when purchased. Beach slope and percent fines will also be monitored as indicators of changes in beach physical conditions.  delineate major vegetation polygons in the intertidal zone  evaluate intertidal vegetation polygons in the field  establish transect and plot locations",
