2. Abstract: This method describes the short-term prediction of circulation in the Columbia River plume. The need for such a method arises from the requirement to guide fisheries cruises and predict ocean entry conditions for barged or hatchery-released smolts. By utilizing simulations conducted within the Virtual Columbia River modeling system maintained at OHSU, this method provides advanced knowledge of the location of plume fronts, improving efficiency and decision-making in fisheries management and smolt releases.

3. Description: The text outlines a method for short-term prediction (hours/days ahead) of circulation in the Columbia River plume. Circulation forecasts generated through simulations within the Virtual Columbia River modeling system can be used to enhance fisheries cruises by providing advanced knowledge of plume front locations, as well as assist in determining ocean entry conditions for barged or hatchery-released smolts. The system is maintained at OHSU and serves as a valuable tool for improving decision-making in fisheries management and smolt releases.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide accurate short-term circulation forecasts for the Columbia River plume, with applications in guiding fisheries cruises and determining ocean entry conditions for smolts.

5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method include the need for reliable data inputs and computational resources to conduct simulations within the Virtual Columbia River modeling system. Additionally, as with any predictive model, there may be inherent limitations and uncertainties associated with the accuracy of the forecasts generated by this method.
