2. Abstract: The RBT (River Bankfull Thalweg) is a suite of GIS tools designed for analyzing river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). These DEMs can be derived from LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys. The RBT offers various functionalities, such as detrending the DEM to remove valley slope, defining hydraulic geometry in cross sections, computing stream gradient and sinuosity, mapping longitudinal variations, and investigating water depth distribution. By generating a thalweg based on bankfull width/depth, it helps identify residual pools, which can be used for fish habitat identification. The RBT serves as an extension to ArcGIS software, requiring its installation before use.

3. Description: The RBT tools work within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software and allow users to analyze river channels with high-resolution DEMs derived from airborne remote sensing (LiDAR) or ground-based topographic surveys. Users can detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope, cut user-defined cross sections, define bankfull width/depth in each cross section, and compute stream gradient and sinuosity. Longitudinal variations in channel geometry metrics can be mapped by cutting long profiles down the length of a channel. The RBT also enables users to vary water levels in a detrended DEM, allowing investigation into the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitats still connected to main stem flow. Residual pools are located using this method, which can help identify fish habitats. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension, requiring prior installation of the software for utilizing its tools.

4. Target: River channel analysis and measurement data identification.

5. Constraints: Users must have ESRI's ArcGIS installed before using any of the RBT tools. The method's effectiveness relies on accurate and high-resolution DEMs derived from airborne remote sensing or ground-based topographic surveys.
