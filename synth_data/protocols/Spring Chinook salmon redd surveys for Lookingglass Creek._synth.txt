 1. Abstract: This protocol focuses on evaluating the re-introduction of Chinook salmon to Lookingglass Creek and determining the effects of habitat actions on natural-origin spring Chinook salmon abundance in the Upper Grande Ronde River Subbasin. The methods include counting redds, using accurate GPS coordinates, and estimating the number of spawning females and natural-origin spring Chinook salmon spawners over time.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes:
Values: Protecting and conserving the Chinook salmon population in the Upper Grande Ronde River Subbasin.
Problem Statement: The decline in Chinook salmon populations in Lookingglass Creek and the Upper Grande Ronde River Subbasin.
Desired Outcomes: Accurate evaluation of the re-introduction of Chinook salmon to Lookingglass Creek, determining the effects of habitat actions on natural-origin spring Chinook salmon abundance, and preserving the Chinook salmon population in the area.
3. Description: The protocol uses various methods to evaluate the re-introduction of Chinook salmon to Lookingglass Creek and determine the effects of habitat actions on natural-origin spring Chinook salmon abundance. These methods include counting redds, using accurate GPS coordinates, estimating the number of spawning females, and estimating the numbers of natural-origin spring Chinook salmon spawners over time. The protocol provides detailed descriptions of these methods and their significance in achieving the desired outcomes.
