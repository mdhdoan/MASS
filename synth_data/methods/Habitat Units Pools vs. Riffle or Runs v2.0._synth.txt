2. Abstract:
Habitat unit classification is crucial for understanding and managing aquatic ecosystems. In this method, all habitat units within the main channel of a reach are classified as either pools or riffles, providing valuable information on the distribution and characteristics of these essential ecological features. Measurement of habitat units in thalweg length ensures standardization and consistency, while avoiding overlaps between units maintains data accuracy and reliability.

3. Description:
The objective of this method is to classify habitat units within the main channel of a reach as either pools or riffles, using thalweg length measurement to define their boundaries and sizes. Pools are characterized by slower water flow and deeper areas, offering refuge and feeding grounds for aquatic organisms, while riffles have faster currents and shallower waters, providing essential aeration and habitat diversity. By classifying these units and measuring their lengths, managers and researchers can evaluate the spatial distribution of pools and riffles within a reach, facilitating better understanding and conservation of aquatic ecosystems. This method ensures that habitat units do not overlap, maintaining data integrity and reducing potential errors in analysis and interpretation.

4. Target:
The primary focus is to classify and measure habitat units as pools or riffles within the main channel of a reach, without overlaps between them.

5. Constraints:
   - Accurate identification of pool and riffle features
   - Clear definition of thalweg length measurement
   - Consistent application of non-overlap principle for habitat units
