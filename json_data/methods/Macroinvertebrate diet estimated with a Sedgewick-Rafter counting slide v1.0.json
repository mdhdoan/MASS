  "abstractText": "The diet of macroinvertebrates can reveal important food web relationships as well as possible explanations for a species distribution and abundance. Diets can be analyzed in a number of ways depending on different study objectives. Quantifying the proportions of different prey in an invertebrate's stomach is difficult do to their small size. The approach described here relies on examination of macroinvertebrate gut contents and provides a quasi-quantitative description of the diet based on estimating the proportion of different prey in the cells of a Sedgewick-Rafter slide.",
