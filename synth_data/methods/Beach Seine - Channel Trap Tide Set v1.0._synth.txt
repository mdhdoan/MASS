2. Abstract: Beach seining is an effective method used to capture fishes in various aquatic habitats for sampling and research purposes. This technique permits the quick sampling of large areas while minimizing stress and harm to the captured fish. The choice of habitat, net design, and timing depend on the targeted species, water conditions, and seasonal factors. Adapting the method based on these considerations can enhance its effectiveness in collecting valuable data for fisheries management and research.
3. Description: Beach seining is an efficient fish capture method applicable in various aquatic habitats such as rivers, estuaries, lakes, reservoirs, and marine environments (Pierce et al. 1990). The technique is most effective when employed in shallow water with minimal obstructions, where fish are highly concentrated, and for species that are less likely to outswim the net. Seining allows for large areas to be sampled quickly while reducing stress and harm to captured fish by keeping the bunt of the seine underwater and preventing overcrowding (or moving fish to a holding container). The cost of gear, boats, and personnel can vary from relatively inexpensive to modest, depending on sampling scope and frequency.

Several factors influence seining efficiency, including habitat, water conditions, fish characteristics, timing, net design, and deployment method:

* Habitat: Suitable sites have regular bottom topography, minimal debris or large rocks, and sparse aquatic vegetation to prevent net snagging and loss of fish retention.
* Water: Current velocity and depth are important considerations for site selection and net design choice.
* Fish: Mobile species can be captured depending on the circumstances, but seining is generally more effective for less mobile species.
* Time of year and day: Seasonal and diurnal patterns in fish behavior and abundance influence seining success.
* Net: Seine size and design determine capture efficiency; various net types are available to target specific fish sizes or habitats.
* Method: Techniques like channel trap tide set beach seining can be employed for estimating total number, biomass, fish density, and diversity indices.

Understanding these factors can help researchers decide when seining is an appropriate technique for their objectives and improve the quality of collected data through careful planning and calibration studies.

4. Target: The primary goal of beach seining is to efficiently capture fish for sampling, monitoring, and research purposes in various aquatic habitats while minimizing stress and harm to the captured organisms.
5. Constraints: Seining as a method faces several constraints including site suitability based on bottom topography, debris, and vegetation; water conditions like current velocity and depth; fish behavior and mobility; and timing related to seasonal and diurnal patterns. Additionally, net design, type, and deployment techniques must be carefully considered for optimal capture efficiency.
