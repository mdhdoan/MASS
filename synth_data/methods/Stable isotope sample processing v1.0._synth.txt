 1. Keywords: Stable isotope analysis, animal/plant tissue sampling, N15/C13 isotopes, sample processing, laboratory guidelines.
2. Abstract: This method describes the process of preparing samples for stable isotope analysis, specifically focusing on N15 and C13 isotopes in animal and plant tissues. The importance of adhering to laboratory guidelines is emphasized, as it may vary depending on study objectives and organism type. Exclusion of certain tissue types, like parts of the intestinal tract or chitin-rich material in invertebrates, is recommended when possible.
3. Description: The text details a method for processing samples intended for stable isotope analysis, which involves several considerations based on study objectives and organism characteristics. General guidelines include avoiding parts of the intestinal tract or stomach and making exceptions for certain organisms like macroinvertebrates where it may be unavoidable. For invertebrates with high chitin content, such as crayfish and shrimp, only abdominal muscle tissue from the tail should be included. Adherence to laboratory guidelines is crucial for successful sample analysis.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to prepare samples for stable isotope analysis, specifically N15 and C13 isotopes, ensuring optimal results by following laboratory guidelines and considering study objectives and organism-specific factors.
5. Constraints: This method's main constraints involve the need to follow specific laboratory guidelines provided by the receiving lab and the potential difficulty in excluding certain tissue types based on the organism being studied.
