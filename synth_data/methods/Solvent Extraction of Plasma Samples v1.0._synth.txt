2. Abstract: Solvent extraction is a crucial method for preparing fish plasma samples prior to steroid assays. This process separates nonpolar steroids from interfering substances, primarily proteins, in the plasma. Despite claims that solvent extraction may not be necessary for human plasma samples, it is essential for reliable fish plasma steroid measurement due to common interference issues. Different solvents can be used depending on the specific application, with ether being a commonly chosen option. However, peroxides and preservatives formed during ether extraction can introduce additional interfering substances. Alternative methods such as column chromatography and solid phase extraction on C18 columns are available for consideration.
3. Description: The necessity of solvent extraction in steroid assays for fish plasma is discussed, emphasizing that this step separates nonpolar steroids from interfering substances (proteins) in the aqueous phase. While some commercial kits may suggest otherwise, it is critical to reliably measure steroids such as estradiol and 11-ketotestosterone in fish plasma due to frequent interference issues. Commonly used solvents for this process include diethyl ether, ethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, and dichloromethane. However, choosing a solvent depends on the specific application, as each one may introduce interfering substances like peroxides, which form over time in ether. To address this issue, it is important to evaluate the impact of extraction on B/B0 before processing samples. Other techniques, including column chromatography and solid phase extraction using C18 columns, can also be considered as alternatives to ether extraction.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to effectively prepare fish plasma samples for accurate steroid assays by removing interfering substances through solvent extraction or alternative techniques.
5. Constraints: Despite its importance, solvent extraction may introduce additional interfering substances such as peroxides and preservatives from the solvents used. This challenge calls for assessing the effect of extraction on B/B0 before processing samples to ensure reliable results. Alternative techniques like column chromatography or solid phase extraction using C18 columns can be explored to mitigate these issues.
