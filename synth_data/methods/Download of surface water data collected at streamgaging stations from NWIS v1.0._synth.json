  "abstract": " The United States Geological Survey (USGS) gathers water-related information from over 1.5 million sites across the US, its territories, and Pacific Islands. This data encompasses both surface water (e.g., river levels, streamflow) and groundwater. Data accessibility is facilitated through the National Water Information System (NWIS) website which provides current and historical data. Users can select data by type (surface water, groundwater, or water quality) and location for specific information. The ability to refine queries and choose desired output makes it convenient for obtaining daily surface water parameter data from USGS streamgaging stations nationwide. This method is crucial as it ensures comprehensive water-resources data availability, enabling effective management, research, and public access to essential hydrological information.

  "description": " The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for gathering water-resources data from around 1.5 million locations across the United States, including District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. This extensive dataset encompasses both surface water and groundwater information.\n\nSurface water data, a primary focus of USGS, include measurements such as gage height (stage) and streamflow (discharge). These parameters are typically obtained from significant bodies of water like major rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Access to current and historical surface water data can be found on the National Water Information System (NWIS) website.\n\nUsers can retrieve this data by selecting the desired category, such as surface water or groundwater, followed by specifying a geographic area of interest. The NWIS webpage then offers further refinement options, allowing users to choose specific information and define their preferred output format. As an example, daily data for various surface water parameters can be obtained from USGS streamgaging stations nationwide.\n\nUsers can access these datasets online via the URL: http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/. The NWIS web interface makes it convenient for researchers, planners, and other stakeholders to access reliable and up-to-date information on water resources across the United States."

  "constraints": " The given text does not impose any specific constraints on the method for retrieving USGS water resources data. The method described is flexible and can be used to access various types of data (surface water and groundwater) from different geographic areas. The output format can also be defined by the user.\n\nThe constraints mentioned in the text are:\n\n1. Data collection has been carried out at approximately 1.5 million sites across all US territories.\n2. Data are collected under the broad categories of surface water and groundwater.\n3. Surface-water data, such as gage height (stage) and streamflow (discharge), are collected at major rivers, lakes, and reservoirs.\n4. Data can be accessed online via the National Water Information System (NWIS) web site (http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/).\n5. Users can retrieve data by category of data and geographic area, with subsequent pages allowing further refinement.\n\nThere is no mention of any specific constraints on the frequency of data collection, data format, or data access permissions in the provided text."
