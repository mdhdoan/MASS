 1. Abstract: The Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) aims to maintain and restore aquatic and riparian ecosystems to desired conditions on federal lands in the Forest Plan area. A comprehensive monitoring program, Aquatic and Riparian Effectiveness Monitoring Program (AREMP), is implemented to analyze trends in watershed condition, identify causes of unsuitable or unacceptable conditions, and provide a framework for adaptive monitoring at the regional scale. Predictive models and decision support models are developed to improve use of monitoring data and assess the condition of watersheds.
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes: Values include the importance of maintaining healthy aquatic and riparian ecosystems, efficient use of resources in data collection, and adaptive management for long-term sustainability. The problem statement is the need to monitor and manage aquatic and riparian ecosystems within the NWFP area. Desired outcomes include improved watershed conditions, effective use of monitoring data, and reduced long-term monitoring costs through predictive models.
3. Description: AREMP focuses on monitoring 250 watersheds in the NWFP area, collecting data on upslope, riparian, and in-channel attributes. The decision support model evaluates individual indicators and aggregates evaluation scores to determine watershed condition. Predictive models are developed using the collected data to improve use of monitoring data and potentially reduce long-term monitoring costs.
4. Objectives: The primary objective is to assess the condition of 250 watersheds within the NWFP area by collecting information on upslope, riparian, and in-channel attributes within each watershed. Summary of Solution Coverage: This objective covers the main goal of implementing AREMP and conducting comprehensive data collection for evaluating watershed conditions. Keywords: Watershed assessment, data collection, decision support models, predictive models.
5. Target: The primary focus is to effectively monitor and assess the condition of 250 watersheds within the NWFP area.
6. Constraints: The main constraints include minimizing errors due to sampling and observer bias, addressing natural variance both within and between the watersheds, and ensuring efficient and safe data collection practices.
