  "abstractText": "Many old agricultural fields on the management areas were converted to native grassland, shrub, and conifer cover types. Native plant establishment and outbreaks of weedy invaders are monitored on reclaimed fields to evaluate reclamation success and community trends. Sampling will be conducted once a year for the first 3 years after restoration, and then reduced to once every 5 years. Restoration will be considered successful when reclaimed sites have met the criteria as stated below for each cover type.While monitoring was initially used to evaluate the baseline condition of the project area, long-term monitoring will continue to help document trends in plant community health, weedy encroachment, limiting factors for wildlife, and identify/monitor areas of habitat degradation.",
