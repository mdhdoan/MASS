2. Abstract: This method emphasizes the importance of photo documentation in capturing the overall character of a sample reach for future reference and data interpretation. High-quality photos taken at specific locations and featuring prominent area features are recommended to aid relocation and change detection over time. Aerial photography and archiving such images can greatly assist with relocating the reach for future sampling.
3. Description: The text provides detailed guidelines on capturing the character of a sample reach through photo documentation. It highlights the value of high-quality photos, featuring prominent area features, and using aerial photography to mark the top and bottom of the reach and any other distinguishing features. When monitoring condition and trend, taking repeat photos in the same exact frame is recommended, with previous photos used for proper alignment. Additional photos can be taken to represent special situations, impacts or signs of degradation, and problematic features encountered during protocol implementation.
4. Target: To accurately capture the character and conditions of a sample reach through photo documentation for future reference and data interpretation.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method include the need for clear visibility during photo-taking, availability of prominent area features for monumenting photos, and the challenge of aligning repeat photos if previous images are of poor quality or missing.
