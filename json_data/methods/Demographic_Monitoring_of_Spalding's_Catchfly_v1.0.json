  "abstractText": "A standardized status and trend monitoring protocol that works well for all rare plant populations has not yet been fully developed. The 10 m x 10 m plotsused in Hill & Gray (2005, 2006) were small enough to fit inside most of the plant patches and the square shape would work well to minimize site disturbance if oriented parallel to the steep slope. This approach maximized sampling of the available plants while minimizing staff effort. An added advantage is that the plot layout can easily be used to implement more intensive demographic monitoring in the future, if desired",
