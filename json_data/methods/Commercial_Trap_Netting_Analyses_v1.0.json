  "abstractText": "Shortly after lake level manipulations were instituted, increased predation created by a rapid expansion of the lake trout population became a limiting factor for kokanee. In response to predation concerns, actions were taken to evaluate predator reduction strategies and eventually an aggressive predator removal program was implemented. A two-pronged approach using both angler harvest incentives ($15 per fish) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used. This method describes how we analyze the trap net data.",
