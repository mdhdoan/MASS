  "abstractText": "Population declines due to pollution, habitat degradation and unknown causes make some amphibian species significant indicators of habitat quality.Over the last 50 years, many species of amphibians (frogs, toads, salamanders and newts) throughout the world have declined markedly in numbers; some species have become extinct.In many instances, these declines are attributable to adverse human influences acting locally, such as deforestation, draining of wetlands, and pollution.",
