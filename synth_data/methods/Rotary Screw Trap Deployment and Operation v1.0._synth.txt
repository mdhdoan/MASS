2. Abstract: The screw trap is a device used to collect downstream migrating fish in rivers, harnessing the river's flow energy through its cone-shaped structure with tapered flights. The gentle auguring motion ensures fish are not harmed during collection. Safety measures include signage, flashing lights, and deflectors to protect boaters and swimmers from the trap.
3. Description: A screw trap for fish collection consists of a cone mounted on a pontoon barge, covered with perforated plates. Inside are two tapered flights wrapped around a center shaft, oriented with the wide end facing upstream. The river flow's force causes the cone to rotate about its axis, guiding fish into a live box at the rear of the trap. Adjustable winches control the screw's elevation and positioning in the river. A small drum screen, powered by the rotating cone or a paddle wheel, removes organic debris. Safety measures include signage, flashing lights, and deflectors to prevent accidents and protect water users and large woody debris from entering the trap.
4. Target: The primary focus of screw traps is the safe and efficient collection of downstream migrating fish in rivers while minimizing harm to fish and ensuring safety for river users.
5. Constraints: Screw traps can act as navigation hazards, requiring appropriate safety measures, signage, and protective structures to ensure safe operation and prevent accidents. They may also be subject to regulatory restrictions related to fish protection, waterway safety, and environmental impact.
