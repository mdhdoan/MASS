2. Abstract:
This method outlines the process of surveying a stream segment between two cross-section transects, focusing on measuring the Thalweg profile and cataloging Large Woody Debris (LWD). The purpose is to understand the impact of LWD on stream morphology and sediment transport. By categorizing LWD based on size and location, researchers can analyze how various pieces contribute to channel complexity, habitat diversity, and ecological functions.

3. Description:
The method begins with scanning a stream segment between two cross-section transects where Thalweg profile measurements are being made (Step 1). LWD pieces partially within the bankfull channel are tallied based on their small end diameter and length (Step 2, 3, and 4). Next, LWD not in the bankfull channel but spanning or bridging it are tallied and classified (Step 5 and 6). Finally, total counts for each diameter-length class are recorded (Step 7), and the process is repeated for subsequent stream segments (Step 8).

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to systematically catalog Large Woody Debris within a stream segment, contributing to better understanding of its role in channel morphology and ecological functions.

5. Constraints:
This method requires clearly defined cross-section transects and the ability to accurately measure Thalweg profiles and LWD dimensions. The success of this method depends on careful observation, precise measurements, and thorough documentation during fieldwork.
