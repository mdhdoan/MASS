  "abstractText": "The presence and abundance of stream fishes is strongly related to thephysical and chemical characteristics of a stream. With changes in stream size,nutrients and habitat, obvious shifts in fish community structure and functionmay occur.Physical habitat in streams has been measured and quantified by amultitude of methods. Often, these methods are time consuming and costly(e.g., Habitat Suitability Indices, Habitat Quality Index, Index of Biotic Integrity).The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency has developed a methodology termed the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index or QHEI (Rankin 1989, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency 1989, 2006). This index is designed to providea measure of macro-habitat quality that generally corresponds to physical factorsthat affect fish communities and are generally important to other aquatic lifesuch as invertebrates. The QHEI is composed of an array of metrics describingattributes of physical habitat that may be important in explaining speciespresence and absence and composition of fish communities in a stream, without employing the more labor-intensive methods of various Habitat Suitability Indicesdeveloped for specific fish species in the fish community.The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) has developed a streamhabitat assessment worksheet derived from the Ohio QHEI methodology, hereinreferred to as the Minnesota Stream Habitat Assessment or MSHA. Acomparison of the two assessments indicates a very strong similarity; however,the MSHA methodology is believed to be a better reflection of important factorsinfluencing Minnesota streams. DNR Fisheries is adopting the MSHAmethodology, which will facilitate exchange of data between agencies.Standardized definitions for pool, run, and riffle habitats are essential foraccurately using the MSHA. Refer to the definitions for various channel types in step by step.",
