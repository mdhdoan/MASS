2. Abstract: The use of Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags has been a valuable research and management tool for Columbia River Basin fisheries agencies and tribes to mark and track anadromous fish. An information network, PTAGIS, managed by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and funded by Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), has been developed to collect, house, manage, and maintain all anadromous PIT tag data in the basin. The PIT Tag Steering Committee (PTSC) provides technical guidance on best tagging practices, regional input on interrogation sites and facilities, and coordinates training for tagging personnel to ensure standardized techniques and high-quality marking.
3. Description: PIT tags have been employed since 1987 as a method to mark anadromous fish in the Columbia River Basin. Over time, an information network has evolved to manage, collect, and share mark and recovery data. The network includes PTAGIS, which houses all anadromous PIT tag data in the basin, provides data from automated interrogation equipment at mainstem dams and other sites, develops and maintains PIT tag data collection and validation software, offers training on database and data collection software, and manages the separation by code system at dams. The PTSC is responsible for providing technical guidance, regional input, and coordinating training to ensure standardized tagging techniques and high-quality marking.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to effectively mark and track anadromous fish in the Columbia River Basin using PIT tags and a robust information network.
5. Constraints: Successful implementation of this method requires collaboration between various agencies, tribes, and committees, as well as adherence to guidelines regarding tagging locations, disinfection requirements, and specific equipment usage.
