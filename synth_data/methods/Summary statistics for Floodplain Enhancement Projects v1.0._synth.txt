2. Abstract: This method involves the use of an MS Access database to store and analyze field data related to habitat conditions at the reach scale. Summary statistics are calculated from this data to reflect the state of constrained channel projects. These statistics were selected for their high signal-to-noise ratios and include variables such as bankfull height, width, flood-prone width, channel capacity, and more.
3. Description: After collecting field data, it is uploaded into an MS Access database to calculate summary statistics that reflect the habitat conditions at the reach scale. These summary statistics were generally developed as part of the EPA EMAP and were selected for this program based on their high signal-to-noise ratios compared to other potential summary variables. The following variables are reported for Constrained Channel Projects: Sample Date, GPS Coordinates, Reach Length, Reach Width, Bankfull Height (XbfHeight), Bankfull Width (XbfWidth), Flood-prone Width (FPW), Channel Capacity (AvgChCap), Mean Residual Pool Vertical Profile Area, Mean Residual Pool Area, Maximum Pool Depth Average, Pool Tail Crest Depth Average, Changes in Fish Density, Height of Constraining Feature, Channel Constraint Removed, Sinuosity Changes, Pool/riffle ratio, Bankfull Width to Depth Ratio, Area of New Habitat Created, and Volume of New Habitat Created.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to calculate summary statistics that reflect the habitat conditions at the reach scale for Constrained Channel Projects.
5. Constraints: The constraints of this method include the need for proper field data collection and the availability of an MS Access database for data storage and analysis. Additionally, the selection of appropriate summary statistics with high signal-to-noise ratios is crucial for accurate reflection of habitat conditions.
