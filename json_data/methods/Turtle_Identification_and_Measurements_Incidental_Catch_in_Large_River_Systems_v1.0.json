  "abstractText": "A total of 13 species and subspecies of turtles are known to live in the Upper Mississippi River, its backwaters and tributaries (Johnson and Briggler 2012).There are a few species that could be found occasionally, but would likely account for less than 5% of the species composition of any area (Johnson and Briggler 2012).Often when sampling for fish, turtles are a by-catch (Ratcliffet al. 2014). Although they are not the intended research topic, their presence in the catch allows the opportunity to collect additional data about an important component of the ecosystem with minimal additional effort and sampling time.Correct and complete recording of data is absolutely essential to the success of all long term resource monitoring programefforts (Ratcliff et al. 2014). Conversely, failure to comply with data recording procedures compromises the mission of the research andresults in unrecoverable waste of sampling effort (Ratcliff et al. 2014). Procedures for recording data are driven by the need for correct information and documentation of quality assurance and chain-of-custody information. Allfield staff that collect fish and turtle data are expected to understand and comply with data recording and tracking procedures.Electronic data entry has improved the speed and accuracy of collecting and entering data while decreasing the number of potential errors identified in the raw, unreconciled data by an order of magnitude (Ratcliff et al. 2014).",
