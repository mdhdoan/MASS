  "abstractText": "Field teams conduct a number of activities at a base location before and after visiting each stream site. These activities are generally conducted on the same day as the sampling visit. Close attention to these activities is required to ensure that the field teams know where they are going, that access to the stream site is possible and permissible, that all the necessary equipment and supplies are in good order to complete the sampling effort, and that samples are packaged and shipped correctly and promptly. All samples must be transported and/or presented for shipment in accordance with State, Federal, and international regulations. Because of the large geographic area being sampled, it is critical to minimize the potential for transferring exotic or nuisance species of plants and animals (e.g., aquatic milfoil, zebra mussels), or waterborne pathogens.",
