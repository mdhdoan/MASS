2. Abstract:
Reach level average bankfull height calculation is a vital method for summarizing the characteristics of stream reaches using data from channel cross-section surveys. This technique helps water resource professionals and researchers analyze and compare various streams by providing an average value for bankfull heights, facilitating informed decision-making in river management and flood mitigation strategies.

3. Description:
The reach level is a single value summary used to represent numerous attributes of each stream reach. Bankfull height is an essential attribute, representing the elevation where the water surface intersects with the banks during high flows. Channel cross-section surveys collect data on various aspects of the channel, and this method utilizes collected bankfull heights to calculate a reach level average. This process involves analyzing data from multiple cross sections to determine a single representative value for each stream reach. The reach level average bankfull height provides valuable insights into the overall conditions of a waterway, allowing experts to compare different reaches, assess flood risks, and make informed management decisions.

4. Target:
The primary goal of this method is to calculate an accurate reach level average bankfull height for stream reaches using data from channel cross-section surveys.

5. Constraints:
- Data accuracy: High-quality, consistent data collection is essential for precise calculations.
- Sufficient sample size: A sufficient number of cross sections are required to represent each stream reach accurately and minimize variability in the calculated average.
- Adaptation to different channel types: The method may need adjustments based on the unique characteristics of various channels (e.g., meandering, braided) for accurate representation.
