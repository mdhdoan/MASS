  "abstractText": "Genetic samples, if collected and stored properly, can provide high quality/quantity DNA for many decades, if not hundreds of years. Most preservation techniques focus on eliminating water from the sample through chemical or physical drying. This is done since most of the harmful enzymes that degrade DNA require an aqueous environment to function. One of the most common methods for dessication involves storing the sample in ethanol. However, purchasing non-denatured ethanol is usually expensive and requires permits. In addition, shipping ethanol preserved samples requires special packaging and declaration. Finally, ethanol preserved samples need to be checked for evaporation and for dilution, and are best stored in a refrigerator or freezer. An alternative to chemical dessication are dry preservation techniques (Lahood et al 2008). The outline below describes a method for sampling and storing fish tissue on cellulose-based filter paper. This method is simple, rapid and cost-effective, and can be effectively employed for large-scale genetic sampling efforts as part of Parentage Based Tagging and Genetic Stock Identification programs.http://youtu.be/QcZVo6Zz6Cg",
