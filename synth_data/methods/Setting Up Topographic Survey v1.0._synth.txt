2. Abstract:
Channel Topographic Surveying is a crucial method for creating a detailed and continuous surface of channel topography using a total station. This process involves gathering information about various features such as the edge of water, spatial arrangement and perimeter of channel units, tops and bottoms of banks, and other significant topographic points. By acquiring a known location and orientation, this technique enables the measurement and mapping of channel morphology, providing valuable insights for geomorphic research, floodplain management, and habitat assessment.

3. Description:
The Channel Topographic Survey, as explained in section 7 of the CHaMP Protocol, relies on specific survey procedures using a total station to generate a continuous surface of channel topography. The features measured during this process include the edge of water, spatial arrangement and perimeter of channel units, tops and bottoms of banks, and other significant topographic points. These measurements help capture the shape and gradient breaks in the channel. To successfully conduct a total station survey, it is essential to obtain two pieces of information: a known location and a known orientation. This ensures accurate data collection and mapping of the channel's morphology.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of Channel Topographic Surveying is to accurately map and analyze channel topography for various applications, such as geomorphic research, floodplain management, and habitat assessment.

5. Constraints:
The constraints for Channel Topographic Surveying include the need for clear lines of sight for the total station, accurate knowledge of initial location and orientation, and potential limitations due to environmental factors (e.g., weather conditions or dense vegetation) that may hinder data collection. Additionally, the complexity of channel systems and the level of detail required in the survey can also pose challenges in terms of time and resources.
