  "abstractText": "The emigration timing and abundances of wild and naturally produced Chinook salmon and steelhead will be determined through a trapping and marking program using floating rotary screw traps. The screw traps are attached to a cable suspension system anchored by gabion baskets, which allow side to side and upstream/downstream movement of the trap. This setup permits the trap to be fished in the optimum position during most flow conditions.",
