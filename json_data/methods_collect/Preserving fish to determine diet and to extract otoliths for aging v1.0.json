  "abstractText": "Ideally, fish monitoring surveys should minimize the amount of take/kill of specimen regardless of native or nonnative stature. If preservation needs to occur, details about each specimen need to be recorded in detail. Most preservation techniques will affect the weight and length of preserved fish and sometimes the characteristics of the fish (Billy 1982), so measurements and characteristics should be recorded before preservation. However, preserving just thehead of a fishfor specific analyses like age and life history acquired by otolithexamination can be a useful technique for larger specimen. In many fish species, there is little to no significantchanges in properly preservedotoliths(Kristoffersen and Salvanes 1998). Preservation of the stomach contents if conducted properly can also provide valuable information on diet and food web structure (Persons et al. 2013).",
