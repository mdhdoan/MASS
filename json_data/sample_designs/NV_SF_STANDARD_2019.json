  "description": "<p>This Design was developed as part of the AIM strategy to assess Land Use Plan/Resource Management Plan effectiveness. Includes only points on all perennial BLM streams and rivers in the Sierra Front BLM&nbsp;Field office. Previously assessed points &nbsp;from the NV statewide and WRSA projects 2013-2015 will be used as a user sampled to ensure spatial balance of new points aroung locations we have visited previously. These location include non-target (e.g., dry sites), inaccessible, and sampled sites. See the AIM strategy to understand our rejection criteria (reason a point is not sampled).</p>\r\n",
