2. Abstract: Vegetation Intensity Mapping using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a method used to evaluate riparian vegetation coverage in floodplains. This approach utilizes widely available NAIP imagery collected biennially by the USDA. The NDVI formula, NDVI = NIR-RED/NIR+RED, calculates the intensity of vegetation based on reflection in the near-infrared and red spectrums. To ensure accuracy, this method includes digitization of agricultural or residential alterations that may cause false positive signals for actively growing vegetation. The process is implemented using ArcGIS 10.4 for Desktop, with all necessary features included in this version of the software.
3. Description: The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely used indicator for assessing vegetation intensity based on the reflection of light in the near-infrared and red spectrums. NDVI calculations use the formula: NDVI = NIR-RED/NIR+RED, where NIR represents reflection in the near-infrared spectrum, and RED represents reflection in the red range of the spectrum. This method primarily focuses on the assessment of riparian vegetation intensities in floodplains at the river segment scale (10^3-10^5 m) using NAIP imagery collected biennially by the USDA. To improve accuracy, this approach incorporates a digitization of agricultural or residential alterations that may result in false positive signals for actively growing vegetation, such as orchards and lawns. The implementation of this method is facilitated through ArcGIS 10.4 for Desktop, which includes all necessary utility features for the analysis. However, users should note that different versions of GIS software packages may have different names or processes for similar functions.
4. Target: Primary focus - Vegetation intensity assessment in floodplains using NDVI methodology and ArcGIS 10.4 for Desktop.
5. Constraints: This method requires the use of NAIP imagery collected biennially by the USDA, as well as access to GIS software (specifically, ArcGIS 10.4 for Desktop) with all necessary features included. Different versions or packages of GIS software may have different names or processes for similar functions, potentially causing compatibility issues. False positive signals caused by agricultural or residential alterations in the floodplain must be accounted for through digitization to ensure accurate results.
