  "abstractText": "Adult chinook carcasses are collected throughout the Okanogan basin during spawning ground surveys in August-November. The target sample size for carcass recovery efforts is 20% of the spawning population within each reach (Hillman et al. 2014). Carcass recovery efforts occurr simultaneously with redd float surveys. Recovered carcasses are transported within inflatable rafts downstream until a suitable site was found for processing. Biological data is collected from carcasses included sex, fork length (FL) and post-orbital hypural length (POH) to the nearest cm, and estimated egg retention for all females (0 to 5,000 max; visually estimated). Please refer to Protocol ID: 2226 for more information about other metrics collected collected during the Okanogancarcass surveys.All eggs that are not estimated to be within a carcass (i.e. egg retention) were assumed to have been successfully deposited. Any female carcass containing an estimated 5,000 eggs were considered a pre-spawn mortality. Please refer to Method ID: 6747, Estimate Adult Chinook Prespawn Morality for details on analysis for pre-spawn mortality.",
