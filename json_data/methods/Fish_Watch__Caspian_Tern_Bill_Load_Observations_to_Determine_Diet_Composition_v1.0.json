  "abstractText": "Because Caspian terns transport whole fish in their bills to their mates and young, taxonomic composition of the diet can be determined by direct observation of adults as they return to the colony with fish (referred to as bill loads). The diet composition (percent of various prey taxa in the diet) of Caspian terns is investigated during the time that birds reside on breeding colonies, roughly from April through August. In addition to providing data on the types of fish consumed, data collected from fish watch observations can also be used to calculate the total number of fish consumed via bioenergetics modeling (see Method entitled Bioenergetics Modeling to Determine Fish Consumption by Bird Colonies). Presented here are methods used to collect fish watch data at the Caspian tern colony on East Sand Island in the Columbia River estuary.",
