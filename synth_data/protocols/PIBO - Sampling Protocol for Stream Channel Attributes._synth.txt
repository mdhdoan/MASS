 1. Abstract: The PIBO Monitoring Protocol is a program developed to assess the condition and effectiveness of management practices in maintaining or restoring riparian vegetation structure and function within designated areas. The program aims to determine changes in riparian and aquatic habitats over time, focusing on priority biological and physical attributes, processes, and functions.
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes: 
Values: Preservation of riparian and aquatic systems, effective management practices for livestock grazing.
Problem Statement: Assessing the impact of livestock grazing on riparian vegetation structure and function, understanding changes in riparian and aquatic habitats over time.
Desired outcomes: Maintaining or restoring priority biological and physical attributes, processes, and functions within the PIBO area.
3. Description: The PIBO Monitoring Protocol outlines sampling methods used by the program to quantify stream and riparian attributes. These methods have been developed and refined over two decades of use, evaluation, and peer review. The protocol focuses on assessing designated management area practices related to livestock grazing, using metrics like changes in vegetation structure and function, and evaluating trends in riparian and aquatic habitats over time.
4. Objectives: 
Objective: To determine the effectiveness of specific management practices in maintaining or restoring riparian vegetation structure and function, while monitoring changes in these systems over time.
Summary of Solution Coverage: The objective covers a significant portion of the problem statement, focusing on assessing management practices and understanding associated changes in riparian and aquatic habitats.
Keywords: Designated management area practices, livestock grazing, riparian vegetation structure, function, change trends, habitat monitoring.
5. Target: Comprehensive evaluation of the impact of management practices on riparian and aquatic systems within the PIBO landscape.
6. Constraints: The success of the protocol depends on consistent data collection, long-term monitoring efforts, effective collaboration between stakeholders, and addressing challenges related to land management policies and resource allocation.
