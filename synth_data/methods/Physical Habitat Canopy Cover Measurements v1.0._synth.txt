 1. Keywords: Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP), riparian canopy cover, stream temperatures, bank stability, organic material, complex channel habitat.

2. Abstract: This method, derived from the EMAP protocol, focuses on monitoring and measuring the ecological conditions of western wadable streams. It emphasizes the importance of riparian canopy cover over a stream, which moderates stream temperatures and indicates bank stability. The organic inputs from riparian vegetation serve as food for stream organisms and help create and maintain complex channel habitat. This method is crucial for understanding and preserving the health of aquatic ecosystems.

3. Description: The method discussed here is based on an EMAP protocol developed for monitoring western wadable streams' ecological conditions. It includes instructions for measuring riparian canopy cover, which plays a significant role in controlling stream temperatures through shading and indicating bank stability. Riparian vegetation inputs coarse and fine particulate organic material, which serves as food for stream organisms and helps create and maintain complex channel habitat. The presence of organic inputs from riparian vegetation is essential for the survival and well-being of various aquatic species.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to assess the ecological conditions of western wadable streams by measuring riparian canopy cover and its impact on stream temperatures, bank stability, and organic material inputs.

5. Constraints: This method requires resources for data collection, including personnel trained in the EMAP protocol, equipment for measuring riparian canopy cover, and access to western wadable streams. Additionally, the success of this method depends on accurate and consistent data collection and analysis.
