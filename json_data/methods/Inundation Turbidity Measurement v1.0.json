  "abstractText": "Wetland accretion in the Pacific Northwest has been linked to inundation by sediment-laden (turbid) water (Peck et al., 2020). Inundation and turbidity can be easily measured by deploying a turbidity and pressure senson on a wetland platform. When co-located with measurements of long-term accretion (e.g. Surface Elevation Table [SET] data), inundation and turbidity data provide valuable information about sediment supply and delivery.",
