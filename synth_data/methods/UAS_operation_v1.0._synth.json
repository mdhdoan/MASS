  "abstract": " The text describes a method for using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), also known as drones, for collecting aerial imagery within federal agencies under the Department of Interior. This method highlights the requirement for obtaining a license from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to operate UAS and explains that operation, UAS type, and restrictions may vary depending on the agency or entity using it. The text does not go into detail about the required training, aircraft specifications, flight proficiency certifications, or aviation regulations. Instead, it focuses on using a 3RD Solo UAS and assumes the user is already familiar and proficient in flying it.\n\nThis method is important because it ensures that federal agencies follow the necessary guidelines for operating UAS safely and effectively within their jurisdiction. It addresses the need to comply with FAA regulations, ensuring the safe operation of UAS while minimizing potential risks and conflicts with other aircraft or privacy concerns. By providing a clear and concise overview of the process, this method helps users understand the importance of obtaining the proper licenses and adhering to specific operational requirements when using UAS for aerial imagery collection within federal agencies under the Department of Interior."
