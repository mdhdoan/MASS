  "abstractText": "Fish carried in the bills of Caspian terns (referred to as bill loads) or in the foregut of double-crested cormorants can be collected by researchers to determine the diet composition (prey types) of avian predators.  Data on diet composition can be used to determine the impacts of avian predators on juvenile salmonids and other fish of conservation concern in the Columbia River estuary.Described here are the methods used to collect fish samples from Caspian terns (from Roby et al. 2003) and double-crested cormorants (from Lyons 2010) nesting on islands in the Columbia River estuary.  The methods used to analyze fish samples following collection in the field are presented elsewhere (see Method entitled Bioenergetics Modeling to Determine Fish Consumption by Bird Colonies).",
