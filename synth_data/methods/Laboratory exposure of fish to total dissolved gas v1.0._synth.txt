2. Abstract: This method describes the experimental protocol for testing native, resident nonsalmonid fishes using the criteria established by Mesa et al. (2000) for gas bubble trauma (GBT). GBT, a condition affecting fish exposed to elevated total dissolved gas levels, has been extensively studied in juvenile salmonids. However, there is a lack of information on the progression and mortality rates in native nonsalmonid fishes. By adapting the methods of Mesa et al. (2000), this approach aims to fill that gap, providing a foundation for monitoring GBT in various fish species and contributing to regional conservation efforts.

3. Description: The text discusses the necessity of applying the criteria established by Mesa et al. (2000) for GBT assessment to native, resident nonsalmonid fishes. While these criteria have been successful in monitoring GBT in juvenile salmonids, there is a limited understanding of how GBT affects other fish species. The text goes on to detail the experimental protocol for testing native nonsalmonid fishes using these methods. This includes outlining the specific steps of the process and addressing any necessary adjustments or considerations when working with non-salmonid species.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to establish a reliable testing procedure for assessing GBT in native, resident nonsalmonid fishes based on the existing criteria from Mesa et al. (2000).

5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method include differences in susceptibility and responses to GBT between various fish species, as well as potential limitations related to the availability of test subjects or specific environmental conditions required for testing. Additional research may be necessary to further refine the experimental protocol and address any species-specific variations in GBT progression and mortality rates.
