2. Abstract: The Environmental Assessment Program's Standard Operating Procedure (EAP SOP) outlines the process for collecting freshwater samples to analyze fecal coliform bacteria in the lab. This is crucial as fecal coliform bacteria act as indicators of potential pathogenic microorganisms, which can cause diseases. By testing for fecal coliforms using methods like membrane filtration and most-probable number, authorities can assess water quality cost-effectively and ensure public health safety.
3. Description: This EAP SOP details the collection of freshwater samples to analyze fecal coliform bacteria using Standard Methods (SM) 9222D (membrane filtration method) and SM 9221E (most-probable number method with EC medium). The procedures cover various sample collection techniques, including manual methods, the use of a bacteria sampler, or an extension pole. This SOP also addresses challenges like collecting samples from waters with high residual chlorine (treated effluent or receiving waters) and metals contamination. Recognizing that not all pathogenic microorganisms can be tested for due to high costs, this SOP focuses on fecal coliform bacteria as an indicator organism, providing a cost-effective approach to ensure surface water quality and safeguard public health.
4. Target: The primary goal of the EAP SOP is to establish standardized procedures for collecting bacteria samples in surface water, specifically focusing on fecal coliform analysis.
5. Constraints: The method may require specialized equipment (e.g., bacteria sampler, extension pole) and trained personnel to ensure proper sample collection. Adhering to safety guidelines when handling microbiological samples is necessary to prevent exposure or contamination risks.
