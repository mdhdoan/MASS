2. Abstract:
The EPA NARS field methods manual for the 2018/19 National Rivers and Streams Assessment offers a comprehensive guide to assessing the condition of the nation's rivers and streams. The methods cover various aspects, such as water chemistry sample collection, algal toxins, benthic macroinvertebrates, periphyton, physical habitat characterization, fecal indicator (enterococci), and fish assemblage. These standardized procedures facilitate accurate data collection, enabling comparisons over time and promoting collaboration across state, tribal, and jurisdictional boundaries.

3. Description:
The EPA NARS field methods manual focuses on providing detailed instructions for various aspects of the National Rivers and Streams Assessment. The document begins with initial site procedures, followed by laying out the sample reach and modifying sample protocols based on flow conditions. It covers water chemistry parameters, including pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, conductivity, chlorophyll-a, algal toxins (microcystins and cylindrospermopsin), benthic macroinvertebrates, periphyton, fecal indicator bacteria (enterococci), and fish assemblage. The manual also describes methods for whole fish sampling and fish tissue sampling, along with field quality control measures.

4. Target:
The primary focus of the EPA NARS field methods is to establish standardized procedures for assessing the condition of the nation's rivers and streams, enabling accurate data collection, comparisons over time, and fostering collaboration across state, tribal, and jurisdictional boundaries.

5. Constraints:
The main constraints for the EPA NARS field methods include resource availability, training requirements to ensure proper implementation of the procedures, and the need for consistent adherence to the outlined protocols to maintain data quality and comparability across different assessments.
