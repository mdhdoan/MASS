 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are five relevant keywords related to the method described in the text body:

1. Carcass collection and processing
2. Spawning ground surveys
3. Salmon, steelhead, and Bull Trout data collection
4. Georeferenced locations and biological data
5. Pre-spawn mortality monitoring

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
Carcass collection and processing is an essential method used in spawning ground surveys to gather biological data and samples from salmon, steelhead, and Bull Trout. This method involves carefully scanning streams for carcasses, which can be difficult to detect due to various factors such as being covered in silt or fungus, located in log jams or deep pools, or out of the water on the stream bank. When carcasses are found, they are recovered and processed using a standardized methodology that includes collecting georeferenced locations, recording biological data, and checking for marks and tags. This method is crucial for informing life history characteristics and monitoring pre-spawn mortality rates of fish populations.

3. Description:
The text body describes a method used in spawning ground surveys to collect biological data and samples from salmon, steelhead, and Bull Trout carcasses. The process begins with collecting carcasses, which can be challenging due to their potential obscurity caused by various factors such as silt, fungus, log jams, deep pools, or stream banks. Once found, carcasses are recovered and processed using a standardized methodology that involves collecting georeferenced locations, recording biological data, and checking for marks and tags. This method is crucial for informing life history characteristics of fish populations, as well as monitoring pre-spawn mortality rates. Occasionally, carcass-only surveys are conducted to increase recovery rates or opportunistically sample spawning areas surveyed aerially.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to collect biological data and samples from salmon, steelhead, and Bull Trout carcasses during spawning ground surveys.

5. Constraints:
One constraint for this method is the difficulty in detecting carcasses due to various environmental factors such as silt, fungus, log jams, deep pools, or stream banks. Another constraint is the limited number of steelhead and Bull Trout carcasses encountered during surveys, which can make it challenging to gather sufficient data for these populations.
