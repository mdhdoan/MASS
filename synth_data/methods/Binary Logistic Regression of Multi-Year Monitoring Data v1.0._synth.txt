2. Abstract: This method outlines the application of Binary Logistic Regression in Restoration Ecology to predict binary response variables, such as plant survival or presence/absence of a species, based on multiple independent variables. It addresses the challenge of analyzing binary data in monitoring programs and offers a solution that can determine the probability of obtaining one of two possible results given specific independent variable values.
3. Description: The method begins by introducing Logistic Regression as a technique used to discover relationships between explanatory and response variables, with Binary Logistic Regression focusing on nominal, binary dependent variables. Researchers often work with binary outcomes in various fields, and this strategy is applied to data from restoration experiments that measure multiple independent variables (categorical and continuous) over several years. The text highlights the use of Binary Logistic Regression with multiple independent variables to determine tree survival and browse presence odds, accounting for median plant height, which was analyzed separately using a different test to ensure proper analysis.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to demonstrate the application of Binary Logistic Regression in Restoration Ecology for predicting binary response variables based on multiple independent variables and accounting for specific analytical considerations.
5. Constraints: A constraint for this method includes the requirement for binary response data and the necessity of proper statistical analysis when handling continuous independent variables not directly associated with binary outcomes.
