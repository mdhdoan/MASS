2. Abstract: White sturgeon spawning events are crucial for their population growth. However, monitoring these events can be challenging due to the short adhesive period of their eggs. The use of artificial substrates provides an effective solution for documenting the timing and extent of white sturgeon spawning. This method has proven valuable in testing hypotheses related to recruitment failure and has been instrumental in guiding habitat enhancement projects, ultimately contributing to conservation efforts.
3. Description: White sturgeon release their eggs during spring, which are adhesive for a short duration after being broadcast along the substrate. Artificial substrates offer a useful tool for monitoring white sturgeon spawning events by documenting the timing and spatial distribution of these activities. The data collected from artificial substrates have played a significant role in addressing recruitment failure hypotheses, which is essential to understanding population dynamics and implementing effective conservation strategies. Recently, this method has been utilized to guide habitat enhancement projects, further emphasizing its importance for white sturgeon conservation efforts.
4. Target: To enhance monitoring capabilities of white sturgeon spawning events and support conservation efforts through data-driven decisions.
5. Constraints: The effectiveness of artificial substrates as monitoring tools may depend on factors such as water currents, availability of natural spawning sites, and the behavioral preferences of sturgeons. Additionally, artificial substrates should be carefully designed to ensure that they do not negatively impact existing habitats or populations.
