 1. Keywords: Aerial estimation, canopy, understory, groundcover, vegetation types.

2. Abstract: This method, based on modifications from Kaufmann et al. (1999) and Peck et al. (2001), offers a means of generating aerial estimates for various morphological groups of vegetation, including canopy, understory, and groundcover. The subjectivity of the method due to crew variability and estimation abilities is acknowledged, yet it provides valuable general information on bank-specific vegetation types. This approach contributes to better understanding and management of vegetation in aerial contexts.

3. Description: The described method focuses on estimating canopy, understory, and groundcover for various morphological groups of vegetation from an aerial perspective. While the method is influenced by crew variability and individual estimation abilities, it still delivers important general insights into specific vegetation types found in banks. By building upon previous work from Kaufmann et al. (1999) and Peck et al. (2001), this method enhances aerial assessments of vegetation distribution and composition.

4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to provide general aerial estimates for various morphological groups of vegetation, improving the understanding of bank-specific vegetation types.

5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method are its subjectivity to crew variability and estimation abilities. This may introduce inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the results, requiring careful consideration when interpreting or comparing data gathered with this approach.
