 1. Abstract: OBMEP is a long-term monitoring program focused on collecting data about habitat conditions for salmonids in their freshwater life stages. The program uses the GRTS approach to select sites and monitor status and trends of physical habitat, water quality, and biota. By aligning with other regional monitoring programs, OBMEP aims to ensure compatibility and coordinate efforts to assess and protect salmonid habitats.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: 
Values: Importance of protecting and preserving salmonid habitats in the Columbia River Basin.
Problem Statement: Lack of comprehensive long-term monitoring program for salmonid habitat conditions in the region.
Desired outcomes: Improved understanding of status and trends of habitat, water quality, and biota for salmonids, leading to informed decision-making and better management practices.
3. Description: OBMEP's Habitat Monitoring methods were developed based on the Upper Columbia Basin (2004) Monitoring Strategy by Tracy Hillman. The program uses the GRTS approach for site selection and aligns its methods with CSMEP, PNAMP, and EMAP. By coordinating with multiple disciplines and agencies in the Okanogan River Basin, Columbia Cascade Province, and Columbia River Basin, OBMEP ensures compatibility and efficient use of resources. The monitoring program focuses on measuring changes in habitat, water quality, and biota to evaluate the effectiveness of management practices and inform future decisions.
4. Objectives:
Objective: To establish a long-term status and trends monitoring program for salmonid habitat conditions in the Columbia River Basin.
Summary of Solution Coverage: The objective covers the entire problem statement by providing a comprehensive, scientifically rigorous approach to monitor and assess salmonid habitats in the region.
Keywords: Long-term monitoring, salmonid habitat conditions, GRTS approach, CSMEP, PNAMP, EMAP, coordination, management practices.
5. Target: Establishing a robust and coordinated long-term monitoring program for salmonid habitats in the Columbia River Basin.
6. Constraints: Success of the protocol depends on effective collaboration and communication among various disciplines and agencies involved in the project, as well as consistent funding to support long-term data collection and analysis.
