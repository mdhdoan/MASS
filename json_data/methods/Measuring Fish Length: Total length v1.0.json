  "abstractText": "Total length is the measurement of the entire length of a fish's body, from the most anterior part of the fish to the tip of the longest caudal fin rays. Total length can be measured by two conventions - by leaving the caudal fin spread in a natural position or by compressing the lobes of the caudal fin dorsoventrally.",
