2. Abstract: The Columbia River Basin is facing a significant decline in anadromous salmonid populations, with several of them protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). A comprehensive and reliable monitoring strategy needs to be implemented to reduce uncertainties surrounding these declines and develop effective recovery plans. This method proposes continuous monitoring of seven water quality attributes at integrator sites located downstream from each population or subpopulation. These measurements, coupled with flow gauges, help assess the impact of streamflow on water quality and ensure accuracy as per Data Quality Level A standards.
3. Description: The text highlights the necessity for a reliable and comprehensive monitoring strategy to address the decline in Columbia River Basin anadromous salmonids, several of which are listed under the ESA. Current monitoring programs primarily focus on evaluating specific management actions' effects, with data mainly suitable for subpopulation or population-level assessments. However, the ESA mandates species and habitat assessments at various spatial scales, including specific reaches, subpopulations, populations, and the Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU).

To meet these requirements, the method proposes continuous monitoring of seven water quality attributes identified by the UCMS, including temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Monitoring sites are to be located at the downstream end of each population or subpopulation distribution, also known as integrator sites. Seasonal measurements and monthly grab samples should be collected for nitrogen and phosphorous assessment.

Instrument deployment and calibration must adhere to manufacturers' guidelines, and these monitoring stations must be collocated with flow gauges operated by the USGS or WDOE. Coupling water quality monitoring stations with associated flow gauges enables investigators to assess streamflow effects on water quality attributes accurately. The accuracy of water quality instruments should meet Data Quality Level A as defined by the Oregon Watershed Plan Water Quality Monitoring Technical Guidebook (2001).
4. Target: Developing a comprehensive, reliable, and scalable monitoring strategy for anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin to support ESA assessments and recovery planning.
5. Constraints: The success of this method relies on consistent and accurate data collection, adherence to monitoring guidelines, appropriate instrument calibration, sufficient funding, collaboration between various stakeholders, and addressing potential regulatory or logistical challenges.
