 1. Keywords: alkalinity, water buffering capacity, site measurement, CHaMP - Water Chemistry Method, upstream end.

2. Abstract: This method focuses on measuring the alkalinity of water, which is a critical factor in determining its ability to neutralize acids or its buffering capacity. The measurement is taken at the upstream end of each site and reported as a site-level metric. The CHaMP - Water Chemistry Method provides guidelines for collecting and analyzing the data used in this calculation. This method is essential in understanding water quality and its ability to maintain a stable pH level, which has implications for aquatic life and ecosystems.

3. Description: Alkalinity is a measure of the capacity of water to neutralize an acid or its buffering capacity. In this method, the site measurement of alkalinity will be taken at the upstream end of each site, providing a single measurement that represents the site-level metric. The CHaMP - Water Chemistry Method provides background information on the collection and analysis of the data used in this calculation. This method is crucial in understanding water quality, as alkalinity plays a vital role in maintaining a stable pH level, which has implications for aquatic life and ecosystems. By measuring alkalinity at the upstream end of each site, this method provides a standardized approach to comparing alkalinity levels across different sites.

4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to measure and report the alkalinity of water as a site-level metric.

5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need for proper equipment and training to collect and analyze the data accurately. Additionally, the measurement is taken at the upstream end of each site, which may not fully capture the variability of alkalinity levels throughout the site. Furthermore, other factors such as temperature, pH, and the presence of other ions can also affect alkalinity levels, and these should be taken into account when interpreting the results.
