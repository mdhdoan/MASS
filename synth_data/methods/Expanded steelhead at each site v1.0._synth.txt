 1. Keywords: Metric, Total Spawner Abundance (TSA), GRTS surveys
2. Abstract: The text discusses a specific metric used in the calculations for Total Spawner Abundance (TSA). This metric is derived from data gathered through GRTS (Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified) surveys, which are a type of survey design that allows for more accurate and efficient data collection. The use of this metric in TSA calculations is necessary for accurate population assessments of spawning units in a given area.
3. Description: The metric mentioned in the text is a component used in calculations for Total Spawner Abundance (TSA). These calculations are performed using data gathered through GRTS surveys, which are a type of survey design that allows for more accurate and efficient data collection. GRTS surveys divide the study area into strata and then randomly select sampling units within those strata. This method reduces bias and variance in the sample, making it a more reliable way to gather data compared to simple random sampling or other survey designs. The use of this metric in TSA calculations is crucial for obtaining accurate population assessments of spawning units in a given area.
4. Target: The target of the method described is to provide a reliable and efficient way to calculate Total Spawner Abundance (TSA) through the use of a specific metric derived from GRTS surveys.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need for accurate data collection, which requires proper implementation of GRTS survey designs, as well as the need for appropriate calculation of TSA using this metric. Additionally, the accuracy of TSA calculations is dependent on the quality and quantity of data gathered through GRTS surveys, making it essential to ensure that these surveys are carried out correctly and consistently.
