  "abstract": " In this study, researchers aim to determine the status and trend of non-native fish predator density and abundance upstream of McNary Dam in the mainstem Columbia River. The necessity of this study arises from several issues. First, current fish predator abundance and population trends, and juvenile salmonid consumption estimates upstream of McNary Dam are not well understood. Second, non-native species, particularly piscivores, have been identified as a major source of mortality for juvenile anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River. Third, predation is a significant concern for recovery of Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed salmonids in the Columbia Basin.\n\nTo address these issues, the researchers will employ a comprehensive methodology involving data collection, analysis, and monitoring. They will estimate predator fish density and abundance by habitat class in the mainstem Columbia River upstream of McNary Dam. This information will provide insights into where predators are most prevalent and help inform management actions.\n\nAdditionally, they will estimate predatory fish consumption rates by species and size class on juvenile salmon and steelhead. This data is essential to understand the magnitude of the impact predators have on these populations and guide management decisions.\n\nThe study will be conducted under an adaptive management approach. Predator population abundance and growth rates will be monitored and used to evaluate the effectiveness of current and future management actions designed to increase juvenile salmon survival. This approach allows for identification of significant changes in predator population status over time and space and enables quick intervention when necessary, averting or slowing down problems as much as possible.\n\nIn summary, this study uses a data-driven methodology to assess the status and trends of non-native fish predators upstream of McNary Dam in the mainstem Columbia River. The information gathered will help inform management decisions aimed at increasing juvenile salmon survival and mitigating the impacts of predation on ESA-listed salmonids."

The information gathered from this study is crucial for effective fisheries management and the conservation of native salmonids in the area. Here are some potential values that could be gained from investing in this research:\n\n1. Improved understanding of predator fish populations: By estimating predator fish density and abundance by habitat class, we can gain a better understanding of where these predators are most prevalent and how their populations are changing over time. This information is essential for developing targeted management strategies to mitigate the impacts of predation on juvenile salmonids.\n2. Predatory fish consumption rates: Estimating predatory fish consumption rates by species and size class on juvenile salmon and steelhead will help us identify which predators are having the greatest impact on these fish populations. This information can inform management actions aimed at reducing predation pressure on vulnerable juvenile salmonids.\n3. Enhanced fisheries management: The data collected from this study can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of current and future management actions designed to increase juvenile salmon survival. Under an adaptive management approach, this information can help identify significant changes in predator population status over time and space, allowing for rapid response when intervention is necessary.\n4. Informed decision-making: The results of this study can inform decision-making related to the allocation of resources for fisheries management and conservation efforts.

  "description": " This text discusses the significant impact of temporal and spatial predator-prey overlap between non-native piscivorous fish species and juvenile anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River (Erhardt et al., 2018; McMichael, 2018). The upper Columbia River currently hosts approximately 51% of non-native piscivores, which negatively affect native salmonids and the river's food webs (ISAB, 2011; Naiman et al., 2012). Several studies have documented that WAL and SMB consume juvenile salmon and have substantial impacts on their survival in various habitats like the John Day Reservoir (Rieman et al., 1991; Zimmerman, 1999).\n\nThe text also highlights the importance of monitoring predator populations and implementing interventions to mitigate negative impacts on native fish species throughout the Columbia Basin (ISAB/ISRP, 2016; ISAB, 2019). Predation is a significant concern in recovery plans for ESA-listed salmonids, and an ecosystem-based approach is recommended to understand the relative impacts of predation on salmonids by various native and non-native species (Sanderson et al., 2009).\n\nThe objective of this study focuses on determining the status and trend of non-native fish predator density and abundance upstream of McNary Dam in the mainstem Columbia River. By employing an adaptive management approach, predator population abundance and growth rates will be monitored and assessed to evaluate the effectiveness of current and future management actions aimed at increasing juvenile salmon survival (ISAB/ISRP, 2016).\n\nTo achieve this objective, a comprehensive assessment of predator fish density and abundance by habitat class in the mainstem Columbia River upstream of McNary Dam is required. Additionally, predatory fish consumption rates by species and size class on juvenile salmonids should be estimated for a more accurate understanding of their impact on population dynamics.\n\nIn order to accomplish this study's goals, various research methods could be employed such as:\n\n1. Electrofishing surveys: This non-lethal sampling technique can be used to assess fish populations and their density in different habitats. Multiple visits at regular intervals will help monitor changes in population trends over time.\n2. Acoustic telemetry: This method uses underwater receivers to detect tagged fish, enabling the monitoring of their movements and interactions within the habitat.\n3. Diet analysis: Examining the stomach contents of captured fish can provide valuable information on the prey species consumed by predators. By analyzing diet data for various size classes and species, consumption rates can be estimated.\n4. Mark-recapture studies: By tagging and releasing a portion of the predator population, their capture rates in subsequent surveys can be monitored to assess changes in population size over time.\n5. Long-term monitoring programs: Continuous collection of data on predator populations and juvenile salmonid populations will provide valuable insights into trends and potential management strategies.\n6. Statistical modeling: Utilizing statistical models can help estimate predator consumption rates, population dynamics, and the impact of various management actions on predator populations and juvenile salmonid survival."
