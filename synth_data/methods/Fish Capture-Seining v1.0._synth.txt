2. Abstract: Seining is a practical and effective method of fish capture, primarily utilized in habitats with fine-grained substrates such as pools, runs, and meadows where fish populations are abundant and wood is scarce. This technique proves valuable for researchers and fishery managers to study or manage fish populations efficiently.
3. Description: Seining as a method for fish capture is particularly suitable for areas with fine-grained substrates like pools, runs, and meadows, where trees and other forms of wood are sparse. In such environments, fish tend to congregate in higher densities, making seining a feasible option for capturing them. This technique involves using a large fishing net, called a seine, which is stretched across the water body, thereby enclosing and enabling the capture of fish present in that specific area.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of seining is to effectively capture fish for various purposes such as research, management, or harvesting.
5. Constraints: Seining has some constraints, including its limitation to specific habitat types with fine-grained substrates and high fish densities. Additionally, seine nets can only capture fish in the area where the net is deployed, making it less efficient in larger or more scattered fish populations. Furthermore, seine nets may unintentionally capture non-target species or juvenile fish, which could have negative ecological consequences if not properly managed.
