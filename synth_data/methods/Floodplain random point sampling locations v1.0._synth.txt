2. Abstract: This method introduces a technique for generating random sampling points to facilitate fish capture within the active floodplain of a restoration project. The approach is flexible and can accommodate variations in flooding during a 4-month sampling window. While an engineering design and hydraulic model can enhance the method, it remains functional even without them, albeit with some modifications.
3. Description: The primary objective of this method is to establish random sampling points for fish capture within a restoration project's floodplain. The area of focus is a site where flooding regularly occurs and varies throughout a 4-month period. Ideally, the method utilizes an engineering design and hydraulic model specific to the restoration project, but it can still function in their absence with necessary modifications.
4. Target: The primary target of this method is to create adaptable random sampling points for fish capture within a fluctuating floodplain environment during a 4-month timeframe.
5. Constraints: Although the ideal implementation of this method requires an engineering design and hydraulic model, these components are not strictly necessary. However, their absence may necessitate modifications to ensure effective random sampling point generation for fish capture within the project's floodplain.
