  "background": "Current information on the status of fish populations is central to effective fisheries management.  The populations monitored by the Nez Perce Tribe and other co-managers in the Snake River Basin represent key or important natural production areas linked to Tribal fishery resources management and Federal ESA population recovery efforts.  These projects allow comparisons between naturally reproducing fish populations with populations supplemented with hatchery fish.  The Nez Perce Tribe Research Division conducts five common data collection activities associated with the quantification of the standardized performance measures: 1) ground and aerial spawning ground surveys; 2) cryopreservation; 3) weirs, video weirs, sonar applications, and PIT tag detectors; 4) snorkeling, seine, Fyke nets, trawls, purse seines, minnow traps, and electro-fishing; and 5) rotary screw traps.",
