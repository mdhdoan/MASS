  "abstractText": "Our goal is to have cameras surveying the area to witness the positive response in waterfowl use as more habitat management occurs. In our study design biologists place elevated camera traps across habitats in a project area. Photos are taken every hour from sunrise to sunset and each camera trap has a measurable surface area (1 acre)to create sub-samples of density estimates across the project area.",
