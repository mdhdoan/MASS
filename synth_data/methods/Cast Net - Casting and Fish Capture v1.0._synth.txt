2. Abstract:
Cast-net fishing is a traditional method of catching fish that has been used since antiquity. It is a highly effective sampling technique for determining the presence/absence and relative abundance of a target fish species within a specific habitat. The cast net is made up of three parts, including an upper section (net band), middle section (conical-shaped net mesh), and lower section (weighted). By casting the net onto the surface of water in an area likely to contain the targeted fish, the net spreads out into a circular shape and traps the fish within. This method can be used to effectively sample various populations using a small number of field workers, but it is most effective in areas with little cover, smooth bottom sediment, and slow-moving water.

3. Description:
Cast-net fishing is a sampling technique that involves using a cast net to catch fish. The cast net is made up of three parts: the upper section (net band), middle section (conical-shaped net mesh), and lower section (weighted). To use the cast net, a researcher or fisherman casts it onto the surface of water in an area likely to contain the targeted fish. When hurled into the air, the net spreads out into a circular shape and expands, and as it hits the water surface, the weighted edges descend into the water in a circular shape, trapping the targeted fish within the circular section. Once the weighted portions of the net reach the bottom of the stream, the top band of the net is pulled, cinching the net closed into a sacklike shape within the water. By using information such as the area of the expanded cast net, the number of times the net is cast, and the number of fish caught in each cast, it is possible to estimate the abundance of a target fish species within a fixed habitat.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of cast-net fishing is to catch fish for various purposes, such as research, food, or recreation. This method is highly effective in determining the presence/absence and relative abundance of a target fish species within a specific habitat.

5. Constraints:
There are several constraints for cast-net fishing, including the need for clear water and an open casting area without submerged logs, grass, or other obstructions. Additionally, this method is not suitable for deep or swiftly flowing streams or rivers, as the net may not be able to reach the bottom or cover a large enough area. Finally, cast-net fishing requires practice and skill to ensure that the net is deployed correctly and effectively traps the targeted fish.
