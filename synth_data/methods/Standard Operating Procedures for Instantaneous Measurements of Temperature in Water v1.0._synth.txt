2. Abstract: This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the method for making instantaneous temperature measurements in water as part of the Environmental Assessment Program. The necessity for this SOP arises from the need to have a consistent and accurate approach when measuring temperature in various projects. By following this SOP, investigators can ensure that they choose appropriate equipment based on their project's accuracy and precision requirements, thus enabling reliable and comparable temperature data collection.

3. Description: The text presents a protocol for making instantaneous measurements of temperature in water, specifically focusing on the Environmental Assessment Program's various instruments. Examples of such devices include mercury thermometers, alcohol thermometers, Hydrolab DataSondes, Hydrolab MiniSondes, YSI Model 30 Conductivity Meters, and HOBO StowAway TidbiTs. Investigators are advised to consider the specific requirements of their projects when selecting the appropriate equipment. It is essential to ensure that chosen devices meet accuracy and precision needs while also being mindful of other constraints such as budget or availability. The SOP emphasizes that this particular document addresses only instantaneous temperature measurements, with continuous measurement methods covered in a separate SOP.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to establish a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for making accurate and precise instantaneous temperature measurements in water within the context of various projects conducted by the Environmental Assessment Program.

5. Constraints: This SOP has certain constraints, including:
   - Equipment availability and budget considerations
   - Project-specific accuracy and precision requirements
   - Compliance with the SOP only covers instantaneous temperature measurements; continuous measurement methods have their own distinct SOP.
