 1. Abstract: The text describes a protocol for monitoring and evaluating the success of a hatchery program and mitigative flows for juvenile Kootenai River White Sturgeon. The goal is to determine the relative abundance, growth, and survival of hatchery-reared and wild sturgeon in the Kootenai River using gill nets for sampling.
2. Values, Statements and Outcomes: The value of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the hatchery program and mitigative flows on the population of juvenile sturgeon in the Kootenai River. The problem statement is the lack of significant wild recruitment since 1972. The desired outcome is to establish a successful hatchery program and determine the impact of mitigative flows from Libby Dam on the survival, growth, disease presence, condition, and movements of hatchery-reared juvenile sturgeon in the Kootenai River.
3. Description: The text describes the use of gill nets as the best method for evaluating significant recruitment of wild sturgeon and catching about 10 wild recruits each year. Hatchery-released juvenile sturgeon are marked to distinguish them from wild sturgeon. The protocol includes monitoring survival, growth, disease presence, condition, and movements of hatchery-reared juvenile sturgeon.
4. Objectives: The objective is to determine the relative abundance, growth, and survival of hatchery-reared and wild sturgeon in the Kootenai River using gill nets for sampling. This objective covers the entire problem statement as it aims to establish a successful hatchery program and evaluate the impact of mitigative flows on the population of juvenile sturgeon in the Kootenai River. Keywords include: Kootenai River White Sturgeon, hatchery-reared, wild recruitment, gill nets, survival, growth, disease presence, condition, movements.
5. Target: The primary focus is to evaluate and establish a successful hatchery program for Kootenai River White Sturgeon and determine the impact of mitigative flows on their population.
6. Constraints: The constraints for this protocol include the lack of significant wild recruitment since 1972, the need for hatchery production to supplement the population, and the use of gill nets as the best method for evaluating significant recruitment while being mindful of ethical considerations for fish populations.
