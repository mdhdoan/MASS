2. Abstract:
Bat hibernation monitoring is an essential tool for conserving bat populations, particularly endangered species like the Indiana myotis and gray myotis. Traditional methods of counting bats in hibernacula have limitations, such as disturbing the bats and causing inaccuracies. However, new techniques such as digital photography and thermal imaging offer more accurate counts and fewer disturbances. These methods can be used to estimate population trends by conducting regular surveys during the same time of year. Long-term datasets from a large number of sites are already available for many species, but there is a need to locate and monitor new hibernacula as they are discovered. Additionally, some bat species form large maternity colonies in caves, mines, and artificial structures, which can also provide estimates of population trends.
3. Description:
The text body discusses the importance of monitoring bat populations during their hibernation period, particularly in caves and mines, to estimate population change and inform conservation efforts. Traditional methods of counting bats, such as manual counts or estimating occupied areas and multiplying by the number of bats per unit area, have limitations, including disturbing the bats and causing inaccuracies. New techniques, such as digital photography, thermal imaging, infrared beam-break technology, and PIT tags, offer more accurate counts with fewer disturbances. These methods can be used to create long-term datasets that will inform conservation efforts for endangered species like the Indiana myotis and gray myotis. Additionally, some bat species form large maternity colonies in caves, mines, and artificial structures, which can also provide estimates of population trends.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to accurately estimate bat populations during their hibernation period by conducting regular surveys using digital photography and other technology-based techniques. This information will inform conservation efforts for endangered species like the Indiana myotis and gray myotis, as well as other bat species that form large maternity colonies in caves, mines, and artificial structures.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is the need to locate hibernacula and maternity colonies, which may not always be known or accessible. Additionally, conducting regular surveys during the same time of year can be challenging due to weather conditions and accessibility issues. Finally, the cost and expertise required for some of the technology-based techniques, such as thermal imaging and PIT tags, may be limiting factors for some organizations.
