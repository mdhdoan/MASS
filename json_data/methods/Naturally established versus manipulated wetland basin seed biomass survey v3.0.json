  "abstractText": "Moist soil management is a valuable tool for the treatment of wetland habitats and the wildlife species associated with wetlands. The ability to manage water levels, create disturbance, and manipulate vegetation to allow for more productive early successionalwetland habitats is crucial to the TD-1 project. Moist soil management provides critical habitat and food sources for wetland obligate and wetland associated species, while also allowing for valuable recreation opportunities. Through this survey effort we will be inspecting seed production in 5 wetland cells. Cell 1 was left to naturally establish,Cells 4 south and 7harrowed and left to grow volunteer vegetation. Cells 2,3, 4 northwest, and cell 4 northeast were disked, harrowed, and broadcast seeded. Seeding rates were ~30lbs an acre.Timeline of eventsMay start harrowing/disking cell 2, 3, 4 and 7.Seeding occurred in mid to late May and all seed was broadcast spread.September started collecting samples.",
