 1. Keywords: Survival monitoring, floodplain revegetation, containerized woody shrubs, transplanted trees, bank stability.

2. Abstract: Survival monitoring is a crucial method for evaluating the success of floodplain revegetation treatments, such as planting container-grown trees and shrubs. This process involves assessing the survival rate of these plants, which helps to establish native woody cover on restored floodplain surfaces. Doing so provides bank stability, natural woody debris recruitment sources, and native cover type distribution throughout the project area. The data collected from survival monitoring can be used to improve future revegetation efforts, ensuring their effectiveness in restoring and maintaining healthy ecosystems.

3. Description: Survival monitoring is a specific method aimed at evaluating the success of floodplain revegetation treatments. This process involves assessing the survival rate of containerized woody shrubs and trees as well as transplanted shrubs and trees installed as part of these treatments. Floodplain revegetation treatments, such as planting container-grown trees and shrubs, are implemented to establish native woody cover on restored floodplain surfaces. This is important for providing bank stability, natural woody debris recruitment sources, and native cover type distribution throughout the project area. Detailed data collection methods for survival monitoring are described in Vegetation Survival Monitoring Method #1308 (<https://www.monitoringresources.org/Document/Method/Details/1308>), ensuring standardization and accuracy in the assessment of plant survival rates.

4. Target: The primary focus or goal of survival monitoring is to assess the success of floodplain revegetation treatments by evaluating the survival rate of planted woody shrubs and trees.

5. Constraints: While survival monitoring provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of floodplain revegetation treatments, it may be limited by factors such as resource availability for data collection, potential variations in planting techniques, and environmental conditions that can impact plant survival rates. Proper planning, standardization, and attention to detail in implementing survival monitoring methods are crucial for overcoming these constraints and ensuring accurate assessments of plant survival rates.
