  "backgroundRationale": "<p>Spalding&rsquo;s catchfly (Silene spaldingii) is a rare plant endemic to the bunchgrass, sagebrush-steppe, and open pine communities of the inland Pacific Northwest. Large portions of these habitats have been eliminated by cultivation or degraded by livestock grazing. Spalding&rsquo;s catchfly was listed as Threatened by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a noxious weed survey conducted in 2003, a Wallowa Resources employee located what he thought was a small population of Silene spaldingii above Joseph Creek on the Precious Lands Wildlife Area in Northeast Oregon. Tribal botanists&nbsp;returned to the site on July 14, 2004 and confirmed that&nbsp;he had indeed located the first population of Spaulding&rsquo;s catchfly on the Tribal lands in Oregon.</p>\r\n",

    "To collect seeds for cryopreservation.",

  "keyAssumptions": "<p>1.Personnel&nbsp;can properly&nbsp;identify&nbsp;Spalding&#39;s Catchfly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.Sampling twice during the growing season will capture all plants present within the plots, with enough information collected to inform introduction, dormancy and pollination of this plant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
  "dataHandlingConsiderations": "Data are collected and recorded in the field by hand using paper data forms and pencil. Use write-in-the-rain paper to ensure legibility. The data are summarized into spreadsheet tables and stored on the tribe's server for later reference.",
  "qualityControlConsiderations": "Rebar was placed on each side of monitoring plots to ensure each 1 m2 section is the same for all revisits. Flagging was placed on each corner of plot with a different color flagging used for the starting point. ",

  "safetyConsiderations": "Terrain and access issues are routinely encountered in the project area. Wilderness first aid certification is required. A satellite phone is a must to be able to contact help in case of emergency.",
  "fieldScheduleNotes": "Access points to the plant's population is very remote, either requiring landowner permission or use of ATVs. ",
  "budgetConsiderations": "Plant population is located so remote, travel costs increase and personnel may need to stay overnight which will incur costs (tents, camp equipment, travel trailers, motel rooms and food). \r\n\r\nCosts for a satellite phone.",
