 1. Abstract: The text outlines the use of partial capture traps and mark-recapture methods to monitor downstream migrating juvenile fish, specifically anadromous salmonids. This approach allows for the collection of important population metrics, such as abundance, migration timing, and survival, which can be used to assess habitat productivity trends while controlling for external factors like Columbia River and ocean conditions. Long-term data collection aims to monitor fish population status and trends.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: 
Values: Importance of preserving and monitoring anadromous salmonid populations.
Problem Statement: Difficulty in accurately assessing juvenile salmonid abundance, life history characteristics, and survival rates downstream of trapping sites.
Desired outcomes: Unbiased estimates of juvenile salmonid abundance, understanding of life history traits, and long-term data collection for monitoring population trends.
3. Description: The text describes the use of partial capture traps and mark-recapture methods to gather crucial fish population metrics in anadromous salmonids. Metrics like abundance, migration timing, and survival are employed to evaluate trends in habitat productivity while accounting for external factors using statistical techniques. The data collection aims to provide a long-term time series to monitor the status and trends of fish populations.
4. Objectives: 
Objective: To provide accurate estimates of juvenile salmonid abundance, determine life history characteristics, and assess downstream survival rates through partial capture trapping and mark-recapture methods.
Summary of Solution Coverage: The objective covers the entire problem statement by detailing a solution to accurately estimate juvenile salmonid abundance and related metrics.
Keywords: Partial capture traps, mark-recapture methods, anadromous salmonids, juvenile salmonid abundance, life history characteristics, downstream survival rates, long-term time series.
5. Target: Accurate assessment of juvenile anadromous salmonid populations and trends.
6. Constraints: Availability and accessibility of trapping sites, potential impact on fish populations during trapping, dependence on external factors (Columbia River and ocean conditions), and the need for advanced statistical techniques to control for external factors in data analysis.
