2. Abstract: Hydroacoustic surveys provide a non-invasive method for estimating the abundance of pelagic fish in lakes and reservoirs. This technique is particularly useful for kokanee populations in Idaho, where it serves as the standard method for assessing their numbers. The survey data, presented as echograms, allow researchers to estimate fish densities and target strength distributions. These estimates, combined with trawl data, help generate age- and origin-specific abundance estimates of the kokanee populations.
3. Description: Hydroacoustic surveys involve the use of hydroacoustics, a nonintrusive method that enables sampling large volumes of water in a short time (Simmonds and MacLennan 2005). This technique has proven to be reliable for estimating fish populations occurring in open water and not close to the bottom or surface. Hydroacoustic surveys provide echogram data, which are further used to estimate fish densities and target strength distributions. These estimates, along with trawl data, generate age- and origin-specific abundance estimates of kokanee populations, offering valuable insights for fishery managers and researchers.
4. Target: The primary focus of the method is to accurately estimate the abundance of pelagic fish, specifically kokanee, in lakes and reservoirs.
5. Constraints: While hydroacoustic surveys offer several benefits, they have limitations, such as challenges in detecting fish close to the bottom or surface, making it essential to use these results in conjunction with other techniques like trawl or gillnet surveys for a comprehensive understanding of species composition, age structure, and size distribution.
