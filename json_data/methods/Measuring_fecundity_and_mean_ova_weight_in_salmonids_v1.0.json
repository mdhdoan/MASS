  "abstractText": "Measurements of fecundity and ova size are important in assessing the reproductive potential of salmonidpopulations. Investigators may wish to estimate the potential number of eggs depositedin a particular stream, in which case the fecundity of females spawning there is a critical piece of information. Likewise, the relationship between body size and fecundity or ova size can be useful when assessing the effects of management actions on the reproductive potential of a fish population.This method describes procedures for determining the fecundity and mean ova weight of salmonid fishes.",
