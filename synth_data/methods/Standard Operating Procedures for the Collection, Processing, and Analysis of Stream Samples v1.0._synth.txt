2. Abstract:
The Environmental Assessment Program (EAP) has established a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for water quality monitoring at Freshwater Ambient Monitoring stations. The SOP outlines the procedures for collecting, preserving, measuring, and analyzing various water quality parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient levels. The primary goal of this method is to ensure accurate and consistent data collection for long-term ambient stream monitoring. By implementing quality assurance and quality control measures, the EAP aims to provide reliable and meaningful water quality data to inform decision-making and protect freshwater resources.
3. Description:
The SOP begins by describing the general stream monitoring procedures used for run preparation, sample collection, measurement, processing, preservation, and shipment. The standard set of samples collected include temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total suspended solids, fecal coliform bacteria, ammonia, nitrate plus nitrite, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, metals, and stage height. Additional samples such as alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total organic carbon (TOC), filtered total phosphorus, filtered total nitrogen, and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) may be collected on a special study request basis. Ambient stations are typically monitored once a month, while dissolved metals are monitored every other month at only a few stations. The SOP also addresses quality assurance and quality control procedures to ensure accurate and reliable data collection.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the method is long-term ambient stream monitoring for freshwater resources.
5. Constraints:
One constraint for this method is the need for specialized equipment and trained personnel to collect and analyze water quality samples properly. Additionally, the SOP notes that not all parameters can be measured at every station due to resource limitations, which may impact the comprehensiveness of the data collected. Finally, weather conditions and other external factors may also affect the ability to conduct regular monitoring activities.
