  "abstractText": "A long-term monitoring programcoordinating stream habitat surveys, juvenile snorkeling inventories, and spawning salmon surveys was developedto determine current salmon habitatconditions and track trends in habitat over time.All field surveys encompass a point randomly selected using a GIS. Methods for the habitat survey portion of themonitoring effort are similar to the basin surveys that have been conducted by the ODFW Aquatic InventoriesProject since 1990. Due to the standard survey length of the monitoring sites, some measurements are taken atincreased frequency while others are omitted. These survey modifications are specific to the monitoring surveys anddo not apply to the comprehensive basin survey.",
