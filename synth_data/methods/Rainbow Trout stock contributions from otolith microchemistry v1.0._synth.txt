2. Abstract: Otolith microchemistry is a valuable method used to determine the spatial origin of adult fish based on Sr 87/86 ratios found near the core of the otolith. This information allows for better population-scale management decisions, including stream protection and restoration prioritization, as well as informed regulation setting.
3. Description: Otolith microchemistry involves analyzing the Sr 87/86 ratios present in fish otoliths to infer the spawning origin of adult fish. This technique is particularly useful at the population-scale, helping managers prioritize and allocate resources for stream protection and restoration efforts, as well as inform regulations based on the majority origins of the fish population.
4. Target: The primary focus of otolith microchemistry is to identify the spatial origin of adult fish populations to aid in management and conservation decisions.
5. Constraints: Otolith microchemistry requires specialized laboratory equipment and technical expertise, limiting its accessibility for some organizations or individuals. Additionally, the accuracy and precision of the method depend on the quality of the otolith samples, which can be affected by factors such as preservation methods, storage conditions, and sample age.
