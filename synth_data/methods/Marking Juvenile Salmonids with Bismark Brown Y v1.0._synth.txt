2. Abstract: A non-technical overview of the method involves estimating juvenile salmonid migration using a technique other than PIT tagging due to size constraints. The alternative approach uses Bismarck Brown stain on a subsample of the total trap catch for a mark-recapture estimate, providing a complementary and cost-effective solution.
3. Description: The method focuses on estimating juvenile salmonid migration using Bismarck Brown stain as an alternative to PIT tagging. Chinook salmon fry, which are often below the minimum size for PIT tags, represent a significant fraction of the total juvenile migration in some study streams. To implement this method, every 3-4 days, a subsample of 10% of the total trap catch (up to 300 individuals) is selected for staining. The fish are immersed in a 0.4g/16 L Bismarck Brown dye solution for an hour, with four battery-powered aerators maintaining oxygen saturation and ice packs keeping the temperature within 1-2Â°C of the river's. Properly stained fish retain the mark for 3-4 days; adjusting the dye concentration and exposure time can fine-tune the mark's effective lifespan, providing researchers with a cost-effective and flexible method for estimating juvenile salmonid migration.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide an alternative, cost-effective approach for estimating juvenile salmonid migration when PIT tagging is not feasible due to size constraints.
5. Constraints: This method's main constraint is the requirement for a mucus layer on the fish, as the dye adheres only to this surface. Additionally, factors such as water temperature and oxygen saturation must be controlled during the staining process to ensure proper marking. Lastly, adjustments in dye concentration and exposure time may affect the effectiveness of the mark for migration estimates, requiring careful consideration when applying these modifications.
