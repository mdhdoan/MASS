 1. Abstract: The Yakima/Klickitat Fisheries Project (YKFP) is a large-scale initiative aimed at increasing natural production of targeted fish populations, specifically spring Chinook salmon, while maintaining genetic fitness and minimizing adverse genetic and ecological interactions with non-target species. The project involves genetic monitoring, including sample collection, processing, and analysis to estimate reproductive success and stock population assignment for both juvenile and adult spring Chinook.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: Values include conservation of fish populations, responsible management of natural resources, and inter-agency collaboration. The problem statement addresses the need to increase natural production while preserving genetic diversity and minimizing ecological impacts. Desired outcomes include improved understanding of population dynamics, informed management decisions, and ultimately, sustainable fisheries.
3. Description: The YKFP utilizes SNP panels for juvenile and adult spring Chinook sample collection, processing, and analysis. Genetic samples from returning adult fish are collected at the Roza Adult Monitoring Facility and processed in the WDFW Molecular Genetics Laboratory. These genetic assignments contribute to a whole river pedigree analysis at the CRITFC lab. Juvenile spring Chinook smolt migrants are sampled at the Chandler juvenile Sampling Facility, with subsamples sent to the WDFW MGL for population of origin assignment.
4. Objectives: The primary objective is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the reproductive success and genetic stock composition of spring Chinook populations in the YKFP. This objective covers the majority of the problem statement by addressing both the need to increase natural production and maintain genetic diversity. Keywords include SNP panels, genetic monitoring, whole river pedigree analysis, and population of origin assignment.
5. Target: The main focus is to enhance and sustain targeted fish populations in the YKFP while preserving genetic fitness and minimizing ecological impacts.
6. Constraints: Potential constraints include limited funding, challenges in obtaining sufficient sample sizes, and the need for advanced laboratory facilities and expertise in molecular genetics. Additionally, coordinating efforts among multiple agencies and tribes may present logistical challenges.
