  "abstract": " This method is designed to refine raw data from radio telemetry detection systems into legitimate telemetry events for animal tracking. It focuses on data gathered using Lotek SRX400 and SRX600 radio telemetry receivers. The significance of this process lies in the fact that not all detected signals are necessarily valid detections of animals; thus, filtering is essential to ensure accurate and reliable information. By implementing this method, we can distinguish between false positives (non-animal sources) and true positive detections (animal signals), enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the animal tracking system. The specifics of the filtering process may include checking signal strength, frequency consistency, duration, and other relevant factors to determine validity."

  "description": " This method outlines the procedure for refining crude radio telemetry detection data from Lotek SRX400 and SRX600 receivers into legitimate telemetry detection events of animals. The process involves filtering raw data to meet specific criteria, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analyses.\n\nThe initial dataset undergoes several checks to eliminate spurious detections. These filters may include:\n\n1. Signal strength threshold: Rejecting detections with signal strengths below a predefined level to minimize false positives.\n2. Duration filter: Excluding brief detections that likely represent noise or interference instead of actual animal presence.\n3. Frequency filter: Removing detections outside the expected frequency band for a specific animal species.\n4. Proximity filter: Eliminating detections that may result from multiple animals being in close proximity, creating interference.\n\nIt's essential to understand that these filters can be adjusted according to the specific application and environment. The goal is to minimize false positives while retaining as many true positive detections as possible.\n\nThe method further emphasizes the importance of calibration for accurate detection and analysis. Regular calibrations should be performed on both the receivers and antennas to ensure that signal strengths are correctly measured and animal locations are accurately determined.\n\nLastly, this refined dataset is typically stored in a database or file format for further processing and analysis using specialized software or statistical techniques."
