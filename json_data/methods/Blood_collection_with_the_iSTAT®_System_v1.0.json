  "abstractText": "This method describes the procedure for collecting blood samples from fish for analysisusingthei-STAT System,a portable clinical analyser of blood parameters. The iSTAT system can analyze a range of parameters, such as pH, haematocrit (Hct), haemoglobin (Hb), HCO3, partial pressure of CO2(PCO2), partial pressure of O2(PO2), Hb saturation (sO2) and Na+concentration. This method summarizes the step-by-step instructions of theProcedure Manual for the i-STAT System, published by Abbott Point of Care. These instructions should be customized for site-specific policies and procedures.",
