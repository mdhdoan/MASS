  "abstractText": "The two primary metrics for analyzing fry growth are weight and length. Fry growth is often calculated in hatchery or laboratory research. Growth can be tracked over a period of weeks or months. For large populations of fish, weight can be measured as an entire group. A sub-sample of fish can be measured to determine the average change in length.",
