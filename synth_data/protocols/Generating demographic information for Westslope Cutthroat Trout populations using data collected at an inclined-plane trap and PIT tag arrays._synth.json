  "abstract": " In order to effectively manage and recover populations of migratory Westslope Cutthroat Trout, it is essential to gather reliable data on their numbers and movements at the tributary scale. This involves generating annual estimates of the number of adult spawners and juvenile to adult return rates.\n\nTo accomplish this, researchers employ various techniques such as inclined-plane traps and weirs in specific tributaries, like Big, Quartz, Sadler, and Sanborn creeks. By sampling these fish, they can obtain annual abundance estimates for migratory adult Westslope Cutthroat Trout at the tributary level. Additionally, examining juvenile to adult return rates provides insight into how many fish are making it back to their spawning grounds as adults, which is crucial information for recovery efforts.\n\nFurthermore, researchers analyze life-history attributes of migratory Westslope Cutthroat Trout, such as migration timing, sex ratio, and mean size, to better understand the population dynamics within each tributary.\n\nTo gain a more detailed understanding of individual fish movements and behaviors, researchers use PIT tag technology. This involves implanting small tags in fish, which can be detected by both portable readers and stationary arrays. By interrogating these tags, they can create histories for individual fish to evaluate seasonal movements within watersheds.\n\nBy collecting and analyzing this data, researchers are able to paint a comprehensive picture of the migratory life-history of Westslope Cutthroat Trout within their respective watersheds. This information is essential for designing effective conservation strategies, as it helps identify limiting factors affecting adult production and provides insights into how to support persistent meta-population structures that ultimately sustain a healthy fishery.\n\nNo code provided in this summary as it focuses on the methodology and its importance rather than specific implementation."

  "description": " This text describes research efforts aimed at monitoring and estimating the annual abundance of migratory adult Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WCT) at the tributary scale. The data collected is essential for recovery programs, as the ultimate goal is to maintain a persistent meta-population structure at the watershed level, supporting a sustainable fishery. To generate reliable estimates, survival rates of WCT during their residence time outside the spawning and early life-history rearing environments are also assessed as a vital rate influencing population trajectories (Stapp and Hayward 2002).\n\nThe text mentions the use of inclined-plane traps and weirs in four tributaries flowing into Priest River for sampling juvenile and adult WCT. These sampled tributaries include Big, Quartz, Sadler, and Sanborn creeks. Individuals caught at these migrant traps represent the population of interest at the tributary or watershed scale.\n\nAnnual abundance estimates for migratory adult Westslope Cutthroat Trout are generated at the tributary level by analyzing data collected through fish sampling using inclined-plane traps and weirs. These estimates provide insight into the health and status of each individual tributary's WCT population, essential for effective management and conservation efforts.\n\nAdditionally, the text discusses estimating juvenile to adult return rates for migratory Westslope Cutthroat Trout at the tributary scale. These rates are crucial in understanding the population dynamics within each tributary and contribute to forecasting future WCT populations.\n\nThe text also mentions examining life-history attributes of migratory Westslope Cutthroat Trout, such as migration timing, sex ratio, and mean size of fish, annually at the tributary scale. These attributes can provide valuable information on population health and help identify factors influencing population trends.\n\nInterrogation histories for individual PIT tagged WCT are created to evaluate seasonal movements within watersheds. This data is obtained using interrogation data from stationary PIT arrays, providing insight into the spatial distribution of migratory life-history stages of Westslope Cutthroat Trout within their respective watersheds. Understanding these patterns can help inform conservation strategies and management plans tailored to the unique characteristics of each tributary or watershed."
