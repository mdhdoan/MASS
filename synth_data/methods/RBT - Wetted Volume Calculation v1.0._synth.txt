 Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize and analyze the text you provided. Here are the five keywords that I believe are most relevant to the method described:

1. GIS tools
2. River channel measurement
3. High-resolution DEMs
4. Channel geometry metrics
5. ArcGIS add-in

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
The River Bathymetry Toolkit (RBT) is a suite of GIS tools designed to work within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software. Developed by North Arrow Research in association with ESSA and the Rocky Mountain Research Station, RBT allows users to accurately measure and analyze river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). These DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing or ground-based topographic surveys. The toolkit offers a variety of features, including detrending DEMs, cutting user-defined cross sections, defining hydraulic geometry, computing stream gradient and sinuosity, mapping longitudinal variations in channel geometry metrics, varying water levels to investigate the distribution of water depths and off-channel habitat, and locating residual pools for fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS add-in, meaning that users must have ArcGIS installed before using any of the tools in the toolkit.
3. Description:
The RBT is a collection of GIS tools designed to work within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software for analyzing river channels. The toolkit allows users to describe and measure river channels using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs), which can be derived from airborne remote sensing or ground-based topographic surveys. RBT offers a variety of features, such as detrending DEMs to remove the longitudinal valley slope, cutting user-defined cross sections through the DEM, defining hydraulic geometry in each cross section, computing stream gradient and sinuosity, mapping longitudinal variations in channel geometry metrics, varying water levels in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow, and locating residual pools for fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS add-in, which means that users must have ArcGIS installed before using any of the tools in the toolkit. The CHaMP- Topographic Point Collection Methods provide background on collection of the measurement data that are analyzed for this calculation.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the RBT is to provide a suite of GIS tools for accurately measuring and analyzing river channels using high-resolution DEMs within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software.
5. Constraints:
The main constraint for using the RBT is that users must have the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software installed before using any of the tools in the toolkit. Additionally, the quality and resolution of the DEM data used can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained from the RBT.
