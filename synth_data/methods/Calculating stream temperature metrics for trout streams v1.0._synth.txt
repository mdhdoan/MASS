**Abstract:**

Stream temperature is an important factor in the health and survival of many aquatic species, including salmonids like the westslope cutthroat trout. To assess stream temperature trends and water quality for these species, researchers use a variety of metrics, such as mean temperature, mean daily maximum temperature, and the percentage of time that temperatures exceed a threshold limit. These metrics are calculated over the summer months, when temperatures are typically at their highest. By analyzing these metrics, researchers can identify streams where water quality is suboptimal, track changes in thermal conditions over time, and evaluate the effectiveness of restorative actions aimed at improving habitat for rearing salmonids.

**Description:**

The text describes a method for assessing stream temperature and water quality for salmonid species, with a focus on westslope cutthroat trout populations. The method involves calculating three metrics over the summer months of July and August: mean temperature, mean daily maximum temperature, and the percentage of time that temperatures exceed a threshold limit. This threshold limit is set at 17°C for streams where westslope cutthroat trout are present, as this has been identified as an upper limit for optimal growth in these species. By calculating these metrics over time and across different stream reaches, researchers can compare thermal conditions, identify areas where water quality is suboptimal, and track changes in temperature trends. This information can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of restorative actions aimed at improving habitat for rearing salmonids, such as riparian restoration or shading projects.

**Target:**

The primary focus of this method is on assessing water quality and thermal conditions for westslope cutthroat trout populations in streams. The goal is to identify areas where temperatures are suboptimal, track changes in temperature trends over time, and evaluate the effectiveness of restorative actions aimed at improving habitat for rearing salmonids.

**Constraints:**

The method described in the text has a few constraints that are worth noting. First, the metrics used in this method are only calculated over the summer months of July and August, which may not capture important temperature trends throughout the rest of the year. Additionally, the threshold limit of 17°C for westslope cutthroat trout is based on a single study, and it is possible that different populations or species may have different optimal growth temperatures. Finally, while this method can help identify areas where water quality is suboptimal, it does not directly address the underlying causes of these temperature trends, which may require additional investigation and action.
