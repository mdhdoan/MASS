2. Abstract:
This method focuses on measuring water-level variation in wetlands, particularly in estuaries where tidal fluctuations play a significant role in shaping their evolution. By reconnecting tidal forces and monitoring the changes in tidal elevation within a restoration project, one can determine inundation periods, circulation patterns, sedimentation/erosion patterns, and vegetation distribution. The method emphasizes the importance of using automated data logging pressure sensors and multiple parameter probes to collect georeferenced water-level data and compute vital tidal stage parameters. Understanding these aspects aids in determining the timing, frequency, and duration of tidal inundation in both reference and restored sites, ultimately providing insights into wetland health and restoration progress.

3. Description:
The text details a method for assessing water-level variation in wetlands, focusing on tidal fluctuations as a key driver of wetland evolution in estuaries. The method highlights the importance of tidal reconnection in restoration projects and the resulting changes in aerial exposure, circulation patterns, sedimentation/erosion patterns, and vegetation distribution. To accurately measure water-level variation, it is essential to collect georeferenced data related to an established vertical elevation datum such as NAVD88 or MLLW.

The combination of water-level and topographic information helps determine inundation periods and assess vegetation response. Furthermore, the method suggests using tidal stage parameters (e.g., MLLW) computed from each recording station to understand the site's tidal dynamics better. Employing automated data logging pressure sensors and multiple parameter probes that combine measurements like depth, temperature, and salinity allows for more accurate and comprehensive data collection.

The primary objective of this method is to measure the pattern of hydrology with respect to a known reference point to determine the timing, frequency, and duration of tidal inundation in both reference and restored sites. This information is crucial for evaluating wetland health and restoration progress.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to assess water-level variation in wetlands and determine the impact of tidal reconnection on wetland evolution, with a particular emphasis on monitoring tidal inundation patterns.

5. Constraints:
Some potential constraints for this method include:
   - Accessibility to the wetland area for sensor installation and maintenance
   - Ensuring the durability and accuracy of data logging pressure sensors and multiple parameter probes in various environmental conditions
   - Securing sufficient funding for purchasing and maintaining monitoring equipment
   - Complying with any legal or regulatory requirements related to data collection and sharing.
