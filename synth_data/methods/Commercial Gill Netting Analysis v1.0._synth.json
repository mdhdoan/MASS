  "abstract": " During the mid-2000s, the growth of lake trout population led to increased predation on kokanee, making it a significant limiting factor for their survival. To address this issue, efforts were made to explore methods for reducing predator populations. In response, an extensive predator removal program was initiated in 2006, which aimed at decreasing the lake trout population and temporarily affecting the rainbow trout population. The strategy employed a two-pronged approach by combining an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting, which included gill nets and trap nets.\n\nThe data collected from gill netting is compiled and analyzed to evaluate the progress of the netting program or make any necessary adjustments. This method became essential due to the detrimental impact of lake trout predation on kokanee populations, threatening their existence in the ecosystem. By implementing this aggressive predator removal program, it allowed for a temporary reduction in lake trout numbers, providing a reprieve for the kokanee population to recover and potentially thrive once more. The gill netting data serves as an important tool in monitoring the effectiveness of this approach, ensuring that appropriate changes are made if necessary to maintain a healthy balance within the fishery."

  "description": " In the mid-2000s, the expansion of the lake trout population led to heightened predation on kokanee, adversely impacting their numbers (limiting factor). To address predation concerns, a comprehensive evaluation of predator reduction strategies ensued. This culminated in the implementation of an aggressive lake trout population collapse program in 2006.\n\nThe two-pronged approach, consisting of an Angler Incentive Program (AIP) and contract netting, was adopted for this purpose. The AIP incentivized anglers to catch and retain as many lake trout as possible, thereby contributing to the population reduction efforts. Contract netting, on the other hand, employed both gill nets and trap nets to efficiently capture large numbers of lake trout.\n\nData collection is a crucial aspect of this program. Through gill netting, we capture and record vital information about the targeted fish species and their populations. This data compilation is essential for assessing progress towards population reduction targets or making required adjustments to the netting program as needed. The gathered data enables us to monitor trends, evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions, and adapt strategies accordingly in order to maintain a balanced ecosystem."

  "constraints": " The text does not mention any specific constraints related to the data compilation method using gill netting mentioned in the text. The method describes how data is collected through gill netting and used for assessing progress or making changes if needed. However, it's important to note that the use of gill nets for fish removal can be subject to regulatory constraints related to fishing licenses, seasons, size limits, and other environmental considerations. These constraints are not mentioned in the text but are relevant to the practical implementation of the method described."
