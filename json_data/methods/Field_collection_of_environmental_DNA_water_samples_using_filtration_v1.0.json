  "abstractText": "We investigated the potential for eDNA tests to provide efficient and temporally sensitive tool for early detection of New Zealand mudsnails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum). We collected water filter samples from two field sites in the Portneuf River near Pocatello, Idaho. The Portneuf River is a 5th-order river that flows ~150 km from its headwaters to its confluence with the Snake River and drains a 3445 km2basin. It is a human-altered, eutrophic river, with high nutrient and sediment loads (Marcarelliet al.2009).",
