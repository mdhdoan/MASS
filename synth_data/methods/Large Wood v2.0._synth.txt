2. Abstract: This method focuses on quantifying all large wood within the bankfull channel of a river reach upstream from a specified point (BR). The need for this method arises due to the importance of large woody debris in maintaining river health and ecological functions. By following the US Forest Service's AREMP and BLM's AIM guidelines, this approach ensures consistent measurement and assessment of large wood throughout the reach.
3. Description: This method aims to quantify all large wood occurring within the bankfull channel and meeting specific size requirements in a river reach upstream from BR (bottom of reach). The US Forest Service's AREMP (Air Resource Evaluation and Monitoring Program) and BLM's AIM (Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring) guidelines are used to determine large woody debris qualifications. These guidelines help ensure consistency in identifying and measuring the size of large wood throughout the reach, providing valuable data for river management and restoration efforts.
4. Target: Quantify upstream large woody debris within bankfull channel meeting specific size requirements.
5. Constraints: Adherence to US Forest Service's AREMP and BLM's AIM guidelines may require specific tools, training, or expertise in assessing and quantifying large woody debris in a river system. Time and resource constraints may also impact the comprehensive coverage of the entire reach.
