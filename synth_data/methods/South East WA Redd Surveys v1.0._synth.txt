2. Abstract: This method outlines the approach used by WDFW for surveying redds, which is similar to OBMEP Redd Survey Methodology with some exceptions. The main differences include measuring redd life, using GPS to determine location without recording coordinates on flags or entering data into Trimble data loggers, not using separate flagging colors, and assessing egg retention instead of checking gonad condition or removing otoliths from carcasses. This method allows for efficient and effective surveying while accommodating WDFW's specific requirements.
3. Description: The text provides details on the differences between the WDFW method and OBMEP Redd Survey Methodology. These differences include WDFW's practice of measuring redd life, using GPS to determine location but not recording coordinates or entering data into Trimble data loggers, not using separate flagging colors, and assessing egg retention instead of checking gonad condition or removing otoliths from carcasses. The method also notes that WDFW does not always conduct surveys upstream, depending on sediment and turbidity conditions.
4. Target: To provide a specific surveys method for WDFW that differs from OBMEP Redd Survey Methodology in several ways.
5. Constraints: This method requires the use of GPS technology and may be limited by sediment and turbidity levels, which can affect upstream surveying. Additionally, it is constrained by a focus on egg retention rather than gonad condition or otolith removal.
