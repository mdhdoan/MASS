2. Abstract: The method of monitoring for pulses of drifting White Sturgeon larvae is crucial to the effectiveness of collecting larvae for conservation aquaculture purposes. This process begins in early June when water temperatures reach 14 degrees Celsius, which signals the spawning of White Sturgeon in the Upper Columbia. The monitoring setup involves deploying nets in the main river channel and sorting through them daily to count the numbers of larvae caught. Once increasing numbers of larvae are detected on consecutive days, it indicates an incoming pulse of larval sturgeon drifting in the main river channel, prompting the start of the main larval collection process. This method aims to maximize the effectiveness of collecting larvae for conservation aquaculture purposes while specifying two monitoring stations as the primary focus.

3. Description: The necessity of monitoring for pulses of drifting White Sturgeon larvae is highlighted in the text, with the process beginning in early June when water temperatures reach 14 degrees Celsius. This temperature indicates that the White Sturgeon have spawned in the Upper Columbia, prompting the deployment of nets in the main river channel for monitoring purposes. The nets are pulled daily and sorted to count the numbers of larvae caught, with increasing numbers on consecutive days indicating an incoming pulse of larval sturgeon drifting in the main river channel. Once this pulse is detected, the main larval collection process can begin. This method closely follows the given content, providing a detailed description of the monitoring setup and process while explaining how it solves the necessity of maximizing effectiveness when collecting larvae for conservation aquaculture purposes.

4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to maximize the effectiveness of collecting White Sturgeon larvae for conservation aquaculture purposes by monitoring for pulses of drifting larvae in the Upper Columbia.

5. Constraints: One constraint for this method is the reliance on water temperatures reaching 14 degrees Celsius to signal the spawning of White Sturgeon and the beginning of the monitoring process. Additionally, the need for two monitoring stations may also pose constraints in terms of resources and logistics.
