2. Abstract:
Greenline photo monitoring is a method used in restoration projects to capture visual conditions within the project area over time. This approach involves collecting and documenting photographic images, which are then repeated at specified intervals according to a monitoring timeline. The main objective of this method is to visually assess the project-scale response to various restoration treatments. By doing so, it helps stakeholders make informed decisions about the effectiveness of implemented strategies and aids in overall restoration progress tracking.

3. Description:
Greenline photo monitoring entails collecting photographic images within a designated restoration project area as a means to document visual conditions. These images serve as valuable references when comparing changes over time, allowing for an assessment of the impact of various treatments on the project's scale. By following a predetermined monitoring timeline, consistent image capturing ensures that the progression of restoration efforts can be accurately measured and evaluated. This method facilitates informed decision-making regarding ongoing strategies and their effectiveness while keeping stakeholders informed about the overall advancement of the restoration project.

4. Target:
The primary focus of Greenline photo monitoring is to visually document and assess changes in visual conditions within a restoration project area over time, using photographic images as the main source of data.

5. Constraints:
Some constraints for Greenline photo monitoring include ensuring consistent image quality, maintaining accurate geolocation information, and adhering to predetermined monitoring timelines. Additionally, post-processing image analysis may require specialized software or expertise. Potential weather conditions might also affect the data collection process, requiring flexibility in scheduling and adaptation to environmental factors.
