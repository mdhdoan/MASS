  "abstractText": "We have been sampling adult salmonids at the Bonneville Dam Adult Fish facility since 1985 to estimate length, age, and length-at-age composition for adult salmonids. Over subsequent years, the project has evolved to incorporate PIT tagging and collection of genetics composition. Sampling at the Adult Fish Facility is regulated by Appendix G of the Fish Passage Plan (see references) which is updated annually.",
