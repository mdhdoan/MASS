 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are five relevant keywords related to the method described in the text body:

1. Workflow
2. AQUARIUS time-series software
3. 7-day running average
4. Min/Max/Median water temperature
5. Data distribution

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
A workflow was created using AQUARIUS time-series software to generate a 7-day running average of water temperature data for a specific project. The analysis included calculating Min/Max/Median values, which can help provide a more comprehensive understanding of temperature fluctuations in the dataset. The results were posted on the internet for easy distribution and accessibility. This method is useful for analyzing large datasets and identifying trends or anomalies in water temperature data.
3. Description:
The text describes the creation of a workflow using AQUARIUS time-series software to calculate a 7-day running average of Min/Max/Median water temperatures for a specific project. The use of a running average helps smooth out short-term fluctuations in the data, making it easier to identify long-term trends or patterns. By calculating Min/Max/Median values, the analysis provides a more complete picture of the range and distribution of temperature values. Once the analysis was complete, the results were posted on the internet for easy access and sharing.
4. Target:
The primary goal of this method is to analyze water temperature data and identify trends or patterns in the dataset.
5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is the need for AQUARIUS time-series software, which may not be readily available or accessible to all users. Additionally, the use of a 7-day running average may not capture shorter-term fluctuations in the data that could be important for certain applications. Finally, posting the results on the internet may raise concerns around data privacy and security, depending on the sensitivity of the information being shared.
