  "background": "Colville Confederated Tribes (CCT) staff will install and operate the weir as a live capture facility for summer/fall Chinook salmon to collect natural-origin broodstock(NOB) and reduce the proportion of hatchery-origin spawners(pHOS). We anticipate using a similar configuration as previous years with some modifications to the design based on past experience with this structure from 2012-2015. Monitoring will be conducted to evaluate weir effects and effectiveness, with metrics dependent on terms and conditions of the permit. Past metrics included water quality, head differential, velocity, tower observations, downstream fish observations, trap counts, and underwater video. Field crew completes the data sheets for daily review by staff biologists. Weekly weir reports include fish injury, mortality, water quality and trapping information. The Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) Lead will be immediately informed of any observations that indicate a potential negative impact to fish health. Critical situations and observations will then be relayed to the CCT representative of the Technical Oversight Group (TOG)the same day, for communication to other TOG members.The purpose of the weir is to assess the feasibility of safe and effective fish capture, handling, release, and by-pass, and to assess the structural integrity and efficiency of the trap and guidance system. Hence, there are several specific questions that need to be investigated relative to the operation. These questions are partitioned into three topic areas: 1. Structural design 2. Operational design 3. Fish behavior and passage. The goal is to collect data that will answer these questions, confirm adequate performance, or indicate inadequate performance. Specific data sheets will be completed for each type of activity conducted by the weir project.The temporary picket weir will be installed when flows allow (less than 2500 cfs, generally early to mid July) and operated at least through the end of September. The trap will not be operated at warmer than 22.5 C (at the Malott gauge). Once temperature drops and trapping begins, the weir will be operated 24/7 until after the thermal barrier breaks down and the abundance of Chinook passing the weir decreases (generally early September). Subsequently, the weir may be operated on a reduced schedule (e.g., 5 days per week). Trapping consists of hourly checks for presence/absence of adult fish. If adult fish are present, staff will net and remove all non-target species (Sockeye and Steelhead) for release upstream of the weir. Hatchery Chinook are netted and transferred to totes for subsistence and ceremonial purposes until our pHOS biological target is met. Natural origin Chinook are netted and transferred to an adult holding tank for hatchery broodstock. Once the weekly broodstock goal is met, all natural origin Chinook are released upstream.A more detailed description of the Okanogan Adult Fish Weir can be found on our website athttp://www.colvilletribes.com/2015_okanogan_pilot_weir_operational_plan.php",
