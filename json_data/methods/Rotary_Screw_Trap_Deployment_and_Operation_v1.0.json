  "abstractText": "The screw trap consists of a cone covered in perforated plate that is mounted on a pontoon barge (see Figure 1). Within the cone are two tapered flights that are wrapped 360 degrees around a center shaft. The trap cone is oriented with the wide end facing upstream and uses the force of the river acting on the tapered flights to rotate the cone about its axis, similar to an Archimedes screw. Downstream migrating fish are swept into the wide end of the cone (typically either 1.5 m or 2.5 m in diameter) and are gently augured into a live box at the rear of the trap (see Figure 2). A winch is used to adjust the forward elevation of the screw, and an additional winch may be used to raise and lower the aft end of the screw if desired. A small drum screen, powered by the rotating cone or a paddle wheel, may be located at the rear of the live box to remove organic debris. When positioned in the river, screw traps are navigation hazards to boaters, float tubers, and swimmers. Signage should be positioned upstream to instruct river users how to avoid the trap safely. Other protective measures may include installing flashing lights to improve the visibility of the trap and deflectors to help prevent water users and large woody debris from entering the trap (see Figure 3).",
