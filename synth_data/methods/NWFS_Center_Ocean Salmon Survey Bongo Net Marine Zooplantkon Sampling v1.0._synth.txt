2. Abstract:
This study, funded by the Bonneville Power Administration, brings together academic and federal scientists to investigate coastal ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. The research particularly focuses on the effects of environmental conditions on coho and Chinook salmon during their early marine life history. A critical area of interest is the Columbia River Plume, which hosts a high abundance of salmonids and is influenced by human activities. Understanding this system can provide insights into how abiotic and biotic factors impact salmon recruitment variability, ultimately contributing to better-informed management decisions for preserving these valuable species.

3. Description:
The Bonneville Power Administration has invested in a long-term effort to study coastal ecosystems and the factors influencing the recruitment variability of Pacific Northwest salmon species, specifically coho and Chinook salmon. Research is currently underway to examine the impact of both biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) environmental conditions on the early marine life history stages of these salmonid populations. The Columbia River Plume has been identified as an essential area for study due to its high abundance of juvenile salmon and higher trophic level predators, making it a key region influenced by anthropogenic (human-induced) factors. By studying this unique ecosystem, researchers aim to gain valuable insights into the complex interplay between environmental conditions and salmon recruitment, which can help inform management decisions and conservation strategies for these vital species.

4. Target:
The primary goal of this research is to understand coastal ecosystems and the factors influencing the recruitment variability of Pacific Northwest salmon species.

5. Constraints:
Possible constraints for this study include limited access to certain research areas, data collection challenges, funding limitations, and potential regulatory restrictions on data sharing or collaboration between academic and federal researchers. Additionally, the complexity of coastal ecosystems and the numerous factors influencing salmon recruitment variability might pose challenges in isolating specific causal relationships or drawing definitive conclusions from the study's findings.
