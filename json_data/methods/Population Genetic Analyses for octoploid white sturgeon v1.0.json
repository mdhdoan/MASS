  "abstractText": "White sturgeon are a long lived amphidromous species that historically ranged extensively throughout the Columbia River Basin, occurring as broadly distributed, overlapping meta-populations (Parsley 2007; Beamesderfer et al. 2012). As early as the late 1880s and as late as the 1980s overfishing proved to be a large contributing factor in decreased productivity and declining population abundances (Mallette 2008). Populations have been in further decline, with greater fragmentation resulting from the advent of dam construction in the mainstem Columbia River and its tributaries that began in the early 1900s. White sturgeon populations have been effectively isolated within the impoundments behind dams throughout the Columbia River. In these regions flow regimes and hydrology have been altered or diminished from their natural state (Barten et al. 2010), affecting availability and quality of preferred spawning and rearing habitat for white sturgeon (Parsley et al. 1993; Rien et al. 2005; Parsley 2007). Most notably, dams greatly restrict migration through the Columbia River corridor (IDFG 2008), as fish passage has not provided the same benefit for sturgeon as has been observed for salmon (Beamesderfer et al. 2011: Beamesderfer et al. 2012) and by some estimates as many as 24 functionally discrete populations have now been created as a result (Parsley 2007).This method outlines procedures to aid incharacterizingthe genetic population structure of white sturgeon throughassessment of migration and gene flow, relatedness, effective population size or number of breeding adults, broodstock enhancement and relative productivity among largely isolated river reaches.",
