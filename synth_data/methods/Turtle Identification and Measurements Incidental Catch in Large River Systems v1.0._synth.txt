2. Abstract: This text discusses the importance of accurate data collection and recording methods for monitoring turtle populations in the Upper Mississippi River. By using electronic data entry systems, researchers can improve accuracy and reduce errors, ensuring the success of long-term resource monitoring programs. Proper data recording procedures are essential to maintain quality assurance and chain-of-custody information.
3. Description: The text highlights the presence of 13 species and subspecies of turtles in the Upper Mississippi River, its backwaters, and tributaries. Occasionally, a few other species may be found, but they account for less than 5% of the species composition in any area. Researchers often encounter turtles as by-catch while sampling for fish, providing an opportunity to collect additional data about these important ecosystem components. The success of long-term resource monitoring programs depends on accurate and complete data recording. Failure to comply with data recording procedures can compromise research missions and result in wasted sampling efforts. Proper data recording and tracking procedures are necessary for all field staff collecting fish and turtle data. Electronic data entry has significantly improved data collection and entry speed, reduced errors, and decreased the number of potential errors by an order of magnitude.
4. Target: Accurate and efficient data recording and collection methods for monitoring turtle populations in the Upper Mississippi River.
5. Constraints: The constraints mentioned are related to ensuring proper understanding and compliance with data recording and tracking procedures among field staff, as well as maintaining the necessary technology and resources for electronic data entry.
