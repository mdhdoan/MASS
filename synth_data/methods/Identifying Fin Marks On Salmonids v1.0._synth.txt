2. Abstract: Fin marks, such as clipped adipose, ventral, or maxillary fins, are crucial in fisheries management. They help identify fish of hatchery origin for selective harvesting and coded wire tag detection. Moreover, fin marks facilitate comparative studies, population assessment, broodstock management, and stray identification. This method enables efficient and accurate monitoring of fish populations and their interactions with natural environments.
3. Description: Fin marking is a long-standing tool in fisheries management with various applications. The most common fin mark is the complete removal of the adipose fin. Ventral (pelvic) fin clips, on either left or right sides, are also common. Less frequently used is the removal of the maxillary process, again, on either side. Fin mark combinations offer even more specific identification possibilities. Users must thoroughly examine the entire fish when looking for marks to ensure accurate identification. Fin marks serve multiple purposes: they help identify hatchery-origin fish in mark-selective fisheries and those implanted with coded wire tags (CWTs). They also enable comparative studies by indicating treatment and control groups. Additionally, fin marks assist in population assessment, broodstock management, and stray identification.
4. Target: Fin marking aims to provide a reliable method for identifying fish of hatchery origin, tracking individual fish, facilitating research, and managing fish populations in natural environments.
5. Constraints: Fin marking may face limitations due to the potential for similar marks appearing naturally on wild fish or other marking methods being unnoticed during visual inspections. Additionally, fin marking might not be suitable for certain species due to their delicate fins or swimming behaviors, which could lead to self-inflicted injuries or impaired mobility.
