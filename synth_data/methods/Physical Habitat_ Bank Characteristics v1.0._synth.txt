2. Abstract: The method discussed is based on an EMAP protocol for monitoring western wadeable streams and their bank characteristics. It outlines the importance of estimating bankful stream channel dimensions for calculating shear stress and bed stability. Key data to be collected includes bank angle, undercut distance, wetted width, bankfull channel width, and mid-channel bars width. These measurements facilitate the calculation of important hydrological parameters, enabling effective management and assessment of wadeable streams' environmental health.
3. Description: This method is derived from an EMAP protocol for monitoring western wadable streams. It includes detailed instructions for collecting essential stream bank characteristics using cross-sectional transects to determine bank angle and undercut distance. Measurements are taken at both the banks, allowing for comprehensive data collection. Wetted channel width and exposed mid-channel bars measurements are also included, as they contribute to estimating bankful stage dimensions. Bankfull dimensions of stream channels are crucial in EMAP surveys for calculating shear stress and bed stability (Kaufmann et al., 1999). The method specifies that data collection should include bank angle, undercut distance, channel incision, wetted width, bankfull channel width, and mid-channel bars width.
4. Target: Stream bank characterization and assessment for EMAP surveys in western wadable streams.
5. Constraints: The success of this method depends on accurate measurements and proper execution of the outlined procedures. Factors such as access to the stream banks and weather conditions might affect data collection, requiring flexibility and potential rescheduling of fieldwork.
