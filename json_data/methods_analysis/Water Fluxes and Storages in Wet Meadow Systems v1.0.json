  "abstractText": "A primary bound on changes to water storage, and therefore late season streamflow in restored meadows, is at the scale of the catchment. The term meadow requires definition here, as it is broadly used to describe a range of ecological or geomorphic features. We therefore refer to the nearly flat surfaces extending between two adjacent hillslopes located in the headwater reaches of mountain catchments as upland valley floors. Geomorphically, upland valley floors include the channel, neighboring alluvial surfaces (floodplains and terraces), and the sub-surface fill of the valley bottom extending vertically to unweathered bedrock (Figure 1). This valley fill creates an unconfined alluvial aquifer, where shallow sub-surface flow is tightly coupled with surface flow. We use the term meadow to refer to the vegetated surface of the upland valley floor and any associated channel-lining wetlands, and wet meadow restoration to refer to bringing the stream surface to an elevation where the meadow area will experience standing water connected to the stream and thus facilitate an ecological shift from xeric to mesic species",
