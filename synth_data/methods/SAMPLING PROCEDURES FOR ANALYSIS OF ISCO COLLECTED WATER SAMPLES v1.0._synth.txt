2. Abstract: This text outlines the procedure for analyzing water samples collected from ISCO automated water samplers. The analysis includes measuring conductivity, total suspended solids (TSS), and turbidity. These samplers are programmable, battery-powered, and can collect water samples four times a day for up to 24 days.
3. Description: The text discusses the sampling procedures for analyzing water samples collected from ISCO automated water samplers. These samplers, manufactured by Teledyne ISCO Co., are programmable and can collect water samples for up to 24 days before needing to be changed. The analysis of the water samples includes measuring conductivity, TSS, and turbidity.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a detailed procedure for analyzing water samples collected from ISCO automated water samplers.
5. Constraints: One constraint of this method is the need for regular maintenance and battery replacement for the ISCO water samplers. Additionally, the analysis requires specialized equipment for measuring conductivity, TSS, and turbidity.
