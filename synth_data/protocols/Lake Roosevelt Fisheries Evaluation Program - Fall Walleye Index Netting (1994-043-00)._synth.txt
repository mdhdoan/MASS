 1. Abstract: The Fall Walleye Index Netting (FWIN) is a collaborative effort between indigenous tribes and the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to assess and monitor the health, abundance, and population structure of walleye and burbot in Lake Roosevelt. Initiated in 2002, FWIN utilizes standardized protocols and modified sampling techniques for collecting data on these fish populations during their even dispersion period in November when water temperatures cool down.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: The importance of preserving and managing the health of fish populations is emphasized as it impacts food security, ecosystem balance, and cultural traditions. The problem addressed is the lack of comprehensive monitoring of walleye and burbot in Lake Roosevelt. Desired outcomes include informed decision-making for resource managers and conservation efforts based on the FWIN data.
3. Description: FWIN employs the Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) sampling method to select random sites for setting experimental gill nets with increasing mesh sizes. The nets collect walleye and burbot, and sampled fish are analyzed for relative abundance, population structure, health condition, sex, and sexual maturity. This data supports managers in assessing the long-term status of these populations in Lake Roosevelt.
4. Objectives: In detail, FWIN aims to provide an accurate representation of walleye and burbot populations in Lake Roosevelt during November by utilizing GRTS sampling and specialized gill nets. The solution coverage includes monitoring changes in relative abundance, population structure, and health of the targeted fish species. Keywords related to this objective are: FWIN, GRTS sampling, gill nets, walleye, burbot, Lake Roosevelt, and November.
5. Target: The primary focus of FWIN is to assess and monitor the walleye and burbot populations in Lake Roosevelt.
6. Constraints: Time constraints related to the specific period for data collection (November) and potential limitations in funding or resources allocated to this collaborative effort might impact the FWIN protocol's implementation and success.
