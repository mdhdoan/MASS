2. Abstract: Tangle nets are a fishing method that offers advantages over traditional gill nets by reducing mortality rates in captured fish, particularly for spring chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). The use of tangle nets, combined with careful handling techniques such as reduced soak time and meticulous removal of fish, has shown promising results in minimizing mortality. This method is crucial for the conservation of salmon populations while still allowing for fishery management purposes like tagging, broodstock collection, and biosample gathering.
3. Description: Tangle nets, also known as tooth nets, resemble gill nets but have a smaller mesh size, enabling fish to be caught by their snout or teeth. This design allows for better post-capture survival rates since the fish can continue respiring in the net and potentially be released alive. Research by Vander Haegen et al. (2002, 2004), Ashbrook et al. (2004a, 2004b), and Farrell et al. (2001) have provided valuable insights into the survival rates of bycatch released from tangle nets. As a result, Columbia River fishery managers have implemented selective tangle net fisheries for upriver spring chinook salmon.

Tangle net fishing can be conducted in areas suitable for gill-net fishing and various habitats, depending on the targeted species, life stage, and population(s). The environment should ideally have cooler water temperatures for optimal fish capture and release. However, adverse conditions like predators, high water velocity, or warm temperatures may increase postrelease mortality rates. Water flow, depth, and river bottom snags can also impact tangle net use. Adult salmonids are typically captured in habitats near migratory routes to spawning grounds, with the potential for capturing both visually marked and unmarked populations of the same species or other fish species (including salmonids). Since fish size may vary among species, selecting the appropriate mesh size is crucial to prevent unwanted bycatch.

4. Target: The primary focus of tangle net use is reducing mortality rates in captured fish while allowing for effective fishery management purposes such as tagging, broodstock collection, and biosample gathering.
5. Constraints: Factors affecting the success of tangle net fishing include adverse environmental conditions (e.g., predators, high water velocity, or warm temperatures), water flow, depth, river bottom snags, and appropriate mesh size selection to minimize bycatch and ensure targeted fish capture.
