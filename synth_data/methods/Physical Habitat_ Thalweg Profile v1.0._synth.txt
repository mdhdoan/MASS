 Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here are five keywords that I think are highly relevant to the method described in the text body:

1. Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP)
2. Thalweg profile
3. Habitat assessment
4. Channel measurements
5. Stream condition evaluation

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
This method provides a comprehensive approach for evaluating the ecological condition of western wadable streams by modifying traditional monitoring methods. Drawing from the EMAP protocol, this method includes instructions for collecting channel measurements and generating a thalweg profile, which is a detailed survey of the maximum flow path depth and other key characteristics at evenly spaced points along the stream channel. By measuring upstream distance in the middle of the channel rather than along the thalweg itself, this approach offers a more accurate assessment of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools. This information can be used to inform conservation efforts and improve the health of western wadable streams.
3. Description:
The method described in the text body is a protocol for monitoring and assessing the ecological condition of western wadable streams, based on an EMAP protocol. The method includes instructions for collecting stream channel measurements, such as measuring wetted width, classifying bed surface particles, and determining the depth of the thalweg (the flow path of the deepest water in a stream channel). To create a thalweg profile, the method calls for surveying the maximum flow path depth and several other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points along the length of the support reach, measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from the thalweg profile can be used to calculate indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools. This habitat assessment modifies traditional methods by measuring upstream distance in the middle of the channel, rather than along the thalweg itself (though each thalweg depth measurement is taken at the point of the deepest flow path at each station).
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to evaluate the ecological condition of western wadable streams by collecting and analyzing detailed channel measurements and generating a thalweg profile. This information can be used to inform conservation efforts and improve the health of western wadable streams.
5. Constraints:
There are several constraints to consider when using this method, including the need for specialized equipment (such as surveying tools) and training to accurately collect channel measurements and create a thalweg profile. Additionally, the method may be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring significant effort to complete. Finally, the accuracy of the assessment may be affected by factors such as weather conditions and changes in stream flow over time.
