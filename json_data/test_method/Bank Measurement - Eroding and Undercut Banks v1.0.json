Actively eroding bankstend to inhibit the development of undercut banks which provide desirable habitat forsalmonids. Unstable, actively eroding banks also degrade riparian vegetation.Salmonids strongly prefer the habitat provided by undercut banks. Flow velocities arelower beneath undercut banks, creating ideal holding areas and cover from predators.",
