  "abstractText": "After field data collection, the data are uploaded into an MS Access database which then computes summary statistics to reflect habitat conditions at the reach scale. These summary statistics were generally developed as part of the EPA EMAP and were selected for this program based on their high signal to noise ratios as compared to other potential summary variables. The following variables are reported for Spawning Gravel Placement Projects:  GPS Coordinates, Sample Date,  Reach Length,  Reach Width,  Gravel Present After Placement,  Percent Fines,  Percent Embeddedness,  Spawner Density,  and Redd Density.",
