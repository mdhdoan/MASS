2. Abstract: The methods of line intercept and point intercept are used to estimate shrub cover, with the former being utilized when shrub cover is less than 5%, and the latter for covers equal to or above 5%. Although point intercept results closely resemble those of line intercept technique at 5% cover, not all shrub species may be detected when cover is below 10%. The transect length and sample size are determined by a protocol, with shorter transects (300 ft) data allowed to be pooled to meet statistical objectives.

3. Description: The text discusses two methods for estimating shrub cover, line intercept and point intercept, with the former being used when cover is less than 5% and the latter for covers equal to or above 5%. Hays et al. (1981) are referenced in relation to these methods. The text highlights that while point intercept results closely resemble those of line intercept technique at 5% shrub cover, not all shrub species may be detected when cover is below 10%. A procedure for determining the transect length and sample size is provided in a protocol. Data from short transects (300 ft) can be pooled to meet statistical objectives, but this method should be consistently applied to all shrub transects within the same cover type once initiated.

4. Target: The primary focus of the method is on estimating shrub cover using line intercept and point intercept techniques, while ensuring consistency in data collection and analysis.
5. Constraints: A constraint for this method is that not all shrub species may be detected when shrub cover is below 10% using the point intercept method. Additionally, once initiated, the pooled data method should be consistently applied to all shrub transects within the same cover type.
