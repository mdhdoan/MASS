  "background": "This document details the monitoring design, procedures, and quality assurance steps necessary to document and report the effectiveness of: Livestock exclusion fencing. Livestock exclusions have the potential to create improvements in bank stabilization, streamside shading, erosion control, and other benefits in a moderate time (5-20 years). The goal of livestock exclusion fencing is to exclude cattle from the riparian area of the stream where they can cause severe damage to the stream by breaking down stream banks and increasing erosion, destroying shade producing trees and shrubs, and increasing sedimentation. By excluding cattle with fencing, these adverse impacts can be avoided and restoration of the shoreline can occur.Monitoring goal: Determine whether livestock exclusion projects are effective in excluding livestock, restoring riparian vegetation and restoring stream bank stability.Questions to be answered: Are livestock excluded from the riparian area?  Has riparian vegetation been restored in the impact reach? Has bank erosion been reduced in the impact reach?",
