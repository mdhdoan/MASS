2. Abstract: This method outlines the steps required to properly lay out a site for monitoring purposes. It is a continuation of Method 831 and assumes that the site has already been located. The method has been updated for 2012, with changes including the removal of a table of reasons for rejecting a site, adjustments in laying out transects, and the elimination of bearing readings from benchmarks to other benchmark locations.
3. Description: This method focuses on the process of laying out a site for monitoring purposes. It is built upon Method 831, which covers locating the site, and thus assumes that this step has already been completed. The 2012 updates to the method include the deletion of a table of reasons for rejecting a site, a modification in the laying out of transects from measuring in the middle of the bankfull channel to the middle of the wetted channel, and the removal of bearing readings from benchmarks to other benchmark locations.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide clear instructions for properly laying out a site for monitoring purposes.
5. Constraints: This method assumes that the site has already been located, and as such, it cannot be used until this step has been completed. Additionally, the 2012 updates to the method may require users to adjust their procedures if they are following an older version of the method.
