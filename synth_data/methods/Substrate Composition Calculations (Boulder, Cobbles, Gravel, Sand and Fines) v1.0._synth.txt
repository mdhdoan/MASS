2. Abstract:
The method described focuses on visually estimating the percentage of various substrate types (boulders, cobble, coarse gravel, fine gravel, sand, and fines) within a wetted site area. By analyzing each channel unit in a site or tier and weighting estimates by channel unit area, the method derives a comprehensive site-level estimate. This approach offers a practical solution for assessing riverbed composition, using the CHaMP-Ocular Channel Unit Substrate Composition Method as a reference for identifying analyzed channel units.

3. Description:
The text outlines a visual estimation method used to determine the percent of different substrate types in a wetted site area. The method involves analyzing each channel unit in a site or tier and calculating the percentage of boulders, cobbles, coarse gravel, fine gravel, sand, and fines. Channel unit areas are weighted when deriving site-level estimates, ensuring that more significant portions contribute more to the final calculation. The estimates are rounded to the nearest 5%, with 1% denoting minimal presence. Metrics for percent boulders, cobbles, coarse and fine gravel, and sand and fines are calculated at the site level. The CHaMP-Ocular Channel Unit Substrate Composition Method provides guidance on identifying channel units analyzed within this method.

4. Target:
The primary focus of the method is to estimate substrate composition within a wetted site area by visually analyzing and weighting channel unit areas in a site or tier.

5. Constraints:
This method's constraints include relying on visual estimations, which may introduce subjectivity and variability, as well as the need for careful identification of relevant channel units based on the CHaMP-Ocular Channel Unit Substrate Composition Method.
