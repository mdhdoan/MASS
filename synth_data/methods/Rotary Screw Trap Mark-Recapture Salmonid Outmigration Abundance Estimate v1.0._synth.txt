2. Abstract: The mark-recapture method is a valuable tool for drawing meaningful conclusions from data collected by a rotary screw trap in various fields. This approach uses a Lincoln-Peterson estimator with a Chapman modifier to increase accuracy and reliability. By implementing this technique, researchers can effectively analyze and interpret data, addressing the challenge of making accurate conclusions from limited samples.

3. Description: The text describes a method that utilizes a mark-recapture procedure for drawing meaningful conclusions from data collected by a rotary screw trap. To enhance accuracy, the Lincoln-Peterson estimator with a Chapman modifier is applied. This technique involves marking a subset of the sample, releasing them back into the population, and then capturing another subset. By comparing the number of marked individuals in the second subset, researchers can estimate the total size of the population. The inclusion of the Chapman modifier helps refine this estimation by accounting for cases where the probability of capture is not constant across all samples.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a reliable and accurate approach for estimating population sizes based on data collected through rotary screw traps, using mark-recapture procedures and advanced estimators.

5. Constraints: This method requires careful planning and execution, as it involves capturing, marking, and releasing a subset of the sample. Additionally, the Lincoln-Peterson estimator with a Chapman modifier assumes that the probability of capture remains constant across all samples, which might not always be the case in real-world scenarios. Researchers should consider these factors when implementing this method to ensure accurate results.
