  "abstractText": "Artificial propagation of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) has the potential to alter the abundance and distribution of males that precociously mature in freshwater and thereby influence ecological and genetic interactions in the natural environment (Pearsons et al. 2009). Annual surveys are conducted to monitor the relative abundance of precociously mature spring Chinook and the proportion of hatchery and wild origin conspecifics, and their distribution both on and away from primary spawning areas. We investigate the abundance and distribution of precociously mature, hatchery and natural origin male spring Chinook salmon during the spawning season (e.g., four to seven months after release from the hatchery). We count the number of precocious males on the spawning grounds while snorkeling during the peak of spawning (Johnson et. all 2011).",
