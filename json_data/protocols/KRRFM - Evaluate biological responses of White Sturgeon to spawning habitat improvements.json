  "background": "As part of the Kootenai River Resident Fish Mitigation (KRRFM) Project, 1988-065-00, Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) is funded by Bonneville Power Administration to monitor and evaluate the effects of Libby Dam operation and other habitat enhancement projects intended to benefit sturgeon and other native species on Kootenai River white sturgeon life stages. Specifically related to this habitat improvement in the meander reach, we are contracted to monitor the efficacy of spawning substrate additions in the current white sturgeon spawning locations of the Kootenai River. The purpose of this document is to provide an outline of how IDFG will monitor and evaluate the habitat enhancement project at Shortys Island. Most of the short-term monitoring of this project will involve IDFG readjusting existing sampling programs in the specific location of the enhancement project. The following monitoring and evaluation plan and study design described below should be an effective means to gauge the effectiveness of the habitat enhancement project under our current program funding capabilities. The goal or the study is to restore natural recruitment of Kootenai River white sturgeon.This work will evaluate the biological response to substrate enhancement pilot projects (SEPPS) installed at Shorty's Island (river kilometer 230.0) and Myrtle Creek (RKM 235) and other habitat projects in the Straight reach near Bonners Ferry. First, we will determine use of the structures by spawning female sturgeon using a Vemco VPS telemetry system, second we will evaluate whether adult sturgeon spawn on the habitat structures by using our standard egg mats, and finally we will evaluate if any successful hatching and subsequent drift occurs by using D-ring plankton nets. Although these 3 methods have been used for many years in this program, we have altered our standard sampling methods and have developed protocols and study designs specific to evaluate these habitat structures. We will use a Vemco VPS telemetry system to evaluate whether female sturgeon are selecting for or avoiding the habitat structures. Similarly, we will evaluate sturgeon spawning and selectivity on the habitat structures using egg mats as an egg deposition medium. Finally, hatching success will be evaluated using plankton nets.",
