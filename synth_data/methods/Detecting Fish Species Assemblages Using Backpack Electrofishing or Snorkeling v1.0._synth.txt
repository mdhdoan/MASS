 Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here are the keywords I've identified from the text body:
1. Electrofishing
2. Collectors permits and ESA clearances
3. Snorkeling
4. Transects
5. Fish survey

Now, let's move on to the other parts of your request:

2. Abstract:
Electrofishing and snorkeling are two methods used in fish surveys to collect data for monitoring and managing fish populations. Electrofishing involves using an electrofisher to stun fish, making it easier to collect and measure them. It is important to obtain the necessary permits and clearances before conducting electrofishing surveys. Snorkeling, on the other hand, involves observing and counting fish from underwater. It is a non-invasive method that can be used in both wadeable and non-wadeable streams. Both methods require careful planning and execution to ensure accurate data collection and minimize impacts on fish populations.
3. Description:
Electrofishing involves setting up an electrofisher with the appropriate settings and using it to sample fish in a reach, moving upstream and changing water after each transect to reduce mortality and track sampling effort. Collectors permits and ESA clearances are required before conducting electrofishing surveys. Snorkeling involves measuring water temperature and estimating visibility before beginning the survey at the downstream boundary of the control reach and proceeding upstream. A two-person snorkeling crew can conduct surveys in wadeable streams, while up to four snorkelers may be needed in non-wadeable areas. Each snorkeler counts fish to the immediate front and to the sides opposite the other snorkeler or as designated by the team leader to avoid duplication of counts. All species of fish observed from one transect to the next should be enumerated, identified, and recorded on a fish survey form. Forklengths should be estimated to the nearest 5 mm. After snorkeling, the underwater visibility of each study area should be rated.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of these methods is to collect accurate data on fish populations for monitoring and management purposes.
5. Constraints:
Constraints for electrofishing include obtaining the necessary permits and clearances before conducting surveys, ensuring that the electrofisher settings are appropriate for the target species and water conditions, and minimizing mortality of stunned fish. For snorkeling, constraints include estimating visibility accurately, avoiding duplication of counts between snorkelers, and identifying and recording all species of fish observed during the survey.
