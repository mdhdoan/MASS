2. Abstract:
Creel surveys are essential for estimating the non-tribal harvest of anadromous fish in the Hood River. With the removal of Powerdale Dam in 2010, additional fishing areas became available, requiring a redesign of creel surveys to accurately reflect the new angling zones. The revised survey area is divided into geographic sections, including sections 3 and 4 that were added after the expansion of angling areas.

3. Description:
Creel surveys on the Hood River have been conducted annually to estimate non-tribal harvest levels of steelhead (winter and summer runs), Chinook salmon (spring and fall runs), and coho salmon. The survey data is reported based on run year, with steelhead estimates covering a period spanning two calendar years. Before 2010, angling was restricted to the lower 4.5 river miles from the river mouth to Powerdale Dam.

The removal of Powerdale Dam in 2010 allowed for expanding the accessible angling areas: upstream of the dam to the confluence with West Fork Hood River (approximately 8 additional river miles) and in the West Fork Hood River from the mouth to Punchbowl Falls (approximately 0.5 river miles). Consequently, angler creel surveys were redesigned to account for these new fishing zones.

The revised survey area now consists of geographic sections, including sections 3 and 4 that were added following the expansion of angling areas. These additional sections provide more comprehensive data on fish harvesting in different regions of the Hood River. (See attached figure)

4. Target:
The primary focus is to accurately estimate non-tribal harvest levels of anadromous fish in the expanded fishing area of the Hood River, post-dam removal.

5. Constraints:
The main constraint for this method is ensuring that the redesigned creel surveys accurately capture and differentiate fish harvest data from the various sections of the expanded Hood River fishing areas.
