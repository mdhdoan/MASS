 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are five relevant keywords that summarize the main topics and themes covered in the text body:

1. Stormwater sampling
2. Automated equipment
3. Composite samples
4. Sampling methods (flow-weighted, time-weighted)
5. Particle size limitations of automatic samplers

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
This document outlines the Department of Ecology's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for collecting stormwater samples using automated equipment. The SOP provides guidelines and procedures for programming and installing automatic samplers, as well as collecting and processing samples. The method aims to provide representative water quality samples that reflect both flow-weighted and time-weighted sampling and base flow compositing. Automatic samplers can be configured to collect composite samples in various ways, but they may not represent the complete range of particle sizes in water. Therefore, bed load samples and special floatable capture nets may be needed to supplement automatic samplers if information for the complete range of solids is required.
3. Description:
The text body provides a detailed description of the Department of Ecology's SOP for collecting stormwater samples using automated equipment. The SOP covers a variety of technologies used for in-pipe stormwater discharge sampling and may also be applicable to open channel installations. The method describes programming and collection procedures when using automated samplers, including flow-weighted and time-weighted sampling and base flow compositing. Automatic samplers can collect composite samples in various ways, such as constant time/volume proportional to flow rate or flow volume increment, and constant time/constant volume. However, automatic samplers may not represent the complete range of particle sizes in water, particularly bed load material and larger particles. Therefore, bed load samples and special floatable capture nets may be needed to supplement automatic samplers if information for the complete range of solids is required.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide guidelines and procedures for collecting representative water quality samples using automated equipment for stormwater discharge sampling.
5. Constraints:
The main constraint of this method is that automatic samplers may not represent the complete range of particle sizes in water, particularly bed load material and larger particles. Therefore, bed load samples and special floatable capture nets may be needed to supplement automatic samplers if information for the complete range of solids is required. Additionally, groundwater, back water conditions or tidal influences and interactions should be avoided in the stormwater sample and may require further modification of these procedures.
