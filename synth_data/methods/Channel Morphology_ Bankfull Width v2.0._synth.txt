2. Abstract:
This method describes how to measure bankfull width in a river system using compass and laser technology. The necessity for this method arises from the importance of understanding river channel geometry, which is crucial for managing flood risk, water resources, and aquatic ecosystems. By identifying key indicators of an active channel, such as breaks in slope, depositional features, and mature vegetation, researchers can accurately measure bankfull width and gain insights into the river's behavior.

3. Description:
The method begins by explaining how to use a compass and laser to measure bankfull width at major transects throughout the length of the site. To ensure accurate measurements, researchers are advised to follow the full AREMP protocol for calibration and setup. The text then outlines six key indicators of an active channel: examining stream banks for an active floodplain, identifying depositional features such as point bars, looking for breaks in slope or changes in particle size distribution, locating mature riparian vegetation, examining the ceiling of undercut banks, and observing signs of active channel reform. Each indicator is explained in detail, with practical advice on how to identify it in the field.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to provide clear instructions for measuring bankfull width in a river system using compass and laser technology.

5. Constraints:
There are several constraints to consider when using this method. First, there must be well-defined bankfull indicators present throughout the length of the site. This may not always be the case, particularly in highly modified or disturbed river systems. Second, researchers must have access to compass and laser technology and be familiar with its use. Finally, interpreting some of the indicators, such as changes in particle size distribution or identifying mature riparian vegetation, may require specialized knowledge or training.
