  "abstractText": "Five distinct population segments of anadromous steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) werelisted as threatened under the Endangered Species Act from 1997-2009. Steelheadpopulations havedeclined due to cumulative factors, including hydropower development, overharvest, deterioration of freshwater habitat, and loss of access to freshwaterhabitat(NMFS 2017).Steelhead streamside incubators (SSIs) are a method of supplementing steelhead to help maintain, rehabilitate, and enhancesteelhead populations. Thegoal of the SSI programistodevelop an experimental project for assessing the potential for using artificial production to increase early life survival of steelhead and salmon populations (Tardy and Denny 2010). SSIs incubate eyed-eggsuntil fry are able to volitionally move out of the SSI. Theoretically, the use of on-site incubation strategies should yield significantly more production than allowing gametes to be spawned naturally because fertilization rates can be maximized in the hatchery prior to outplanting.In the past,hatch success from SSIs has been high, regularly exceeding 90% (Tardy and Denny 2010).",
