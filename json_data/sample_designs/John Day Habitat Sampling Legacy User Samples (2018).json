  "description": "<p>For the final season of CHaMP sampling in the John Day basin, we selected sites that represented high value to ODFW fish research objectives in the Middle and South Forks of the John Day River.&nbsp; All sites were chosen from previously sampled sites, no matter the original design, that had been sampled from 2011 to 2015.&nbsp; Sites sampled 2016-2017 were ignored, as data there were deemed recent enough to have value to current objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the South Fork John Day watershed, priority was given to sites in reaches that have substantial &ldquo;fish data&rdquo;.&nbsp; These include juvenile salmonid abundance, use, survival and growth; adult steelhead spawning use, and/or provide controls for physical habitat restoration projects in other parts of the John Day.&nbsp; In the Middle Fork John Day watershed, priority was given to sites in reaches that are part of the Intensively Monitored Watershed (IMW) project that is ongoing there.&nbsp; Sites of high value are those that have been recently restored, are controls for restoration sites or are slated for near-future restoration projects where pre-restoration habitat data is needed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, a subset of sites from Thirtymile Creek sample design were selected as part of a special project.&nbsp; This project is assessing the long-term effectiveness of riparian fencing in a desert canyon stream with significant steelhead production.&nbsp; One site of this design was sampled in 2011, all others are new samples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This design will load legacy sites from the User Samples&nbsp;JDW0001 and OJD04358 to the 2018 design.&nbsp; These designs are not currently compatible with the CBW Master Sample and therefore a separate design was created to manage the 2018 sites.&nbsp; All sites were selectively identified by ODFW for 2018 sampling so we do not forsee design issues with loading the Master Sample and User Sample sites under different designs for the one-time sampling in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
