  "abstractText": "Provided here are methods used to band and resight banded Caspian terns and double-crested cormorants on East Sand Island in the Columbia River estuary. Adult and juvenile Caspian terns and double-crested cormorants can be captured and banded with field readable leg bands to measure survival, post-breeding dispersal, movements among colonies, age of first breeding, relative dispersal, and the effects of disturbance or dissuasion. Demography and dispersal data is a key component of evaluating the efficacy of management actions to relocate tern and cormorant colonies that pose a risk to the survival of juvenile salmonids and other fish of conservation concern in the Columbia River estuary. Data derived from banding and band resighting is also paramount to our basic understanding of avian biology and ecology. Tern bands resighted by the public or by other, non-project staff at sites throughout North America can be reported via www.mybandedtern.org, a web site dedicated to previously banded Caspian terns. A similar web site for double-crested cormorants may also soon be available. Additional details about banding efforts and the data derived from them can be found in Suzuki (2012).",
