  "abstractText": "Due to human influences degrading and limiting habitat, salmon populations throughout the country have diminished (Scholz et al. 1985; Mengs and Lackey 2005; Gende et al. 2002). Much of fisheries research is concentrated around reestablishing salmonid populations back to their native habitats (Bosch et al. 2007). Artificial salmonid redds have been used to establish or re-establish runs of fish following restoration projects or when habitat is being underutilized (Harshbarger and Porter 1982; Gustafson-Marjanen and Moring 1994). Numerous devices for planting salmonid eggs have been described in the literature (Donaghy and Verspoor 2000). These devices can be modified to hold fewer eggs in order to monitor survival, growth and dispersal timing.",
