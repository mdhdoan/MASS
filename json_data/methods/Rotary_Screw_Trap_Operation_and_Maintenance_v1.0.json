  "abstractText": "Rotary screw traps (RSTs) are used to trap out-migrating salmon and steelhead from their natal streams. The main components of the RST, which are typically assembled at the trap site location, include a trap box, two pontoons and a helical cone. Upon bolting the components together, the system becomes operative or non-operative by lowering or raising (respectively) the cone into or out of the current via a cable and winch pulley system. RSTs can be installed and removed from a stream with two-three staff in a day provided the anchoring system is previously installed. Extreme caution is taken when working around RSTs; especially during periods of cold water and high flows. Trap crews work in pairs and wear personal floatation devices and have safety throw ropes available in case of an accident. All staff wear waders with felt soles to provide traction when working around the trap. Extra precaution is taken during freezing temperatures when the trap is covered in ice. Maintenance and repair of the trap occurs as needed to keep it fishing efficiently and to capture fish safely without causing harm.",
