  "background": "The status of migratory salmonidpopulations are monitored by generating annual estimates of the number of adult spawnersat either the tributary orwatershed scale. It is imperative to generate reliable estimates ofspawners given that one of the primary objectives of recovery efforts is to augment sub-populations of migratory adults that wouldsupport a persistent meta-population structure at the watershed scale andultimately provide a sustainable fishery. Survival rates of salmonidsduring their residence time outside their spawning and early life-history rearing environment, a key vital rate in influencing population trajectories(Stapp and Hayward 2002), are also estimated to understand whether processes in adult rearing environments (e.g., larger streams or lakes)are limiting adult production. Inclined-plane traps and weirshave been employed as a technique to sample juvenile and adult Westslope Cutthroat Trout in four tributaries to Priest River. The sampled tributaries to Priest River are Big, Quartz, Sadler, and Sanborn creeks.",
