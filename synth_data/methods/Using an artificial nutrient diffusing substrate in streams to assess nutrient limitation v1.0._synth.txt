2. Abstract: This study outlines a method for evaluating macro-nutrient limitation in streams using Nutrient Diffusing Substrata (NDS). The NDS are constructed with frames holding polycon cups covered with fritted glass discs, and filled with agar amended with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), a combination of both, or unamended as a control. The NDS are then secured to frames and incubated in riffle habitat units for 21 days. Chlorophyll a and Ash Free Dry Mass (AFDM) will be analyzed using ANOVA to determine nutrient limitation. This method aims to characterize and assess nutrient limitation in study streams, which can inform decisions on nutrient enrichment treatments for nutrient limited streams in the upper Salmon River subbasin.
3. Description: The text describes a method for evaluating macro-nutrient limitation in streams using NDS amended with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), a combination of both, or unamended as a control. The NDS are constructed with frames holding 30 ml polycon cups covered with fritted glass discs. Cups will be filled with 2% agar amended with either a 0.5M solution of NaNO3 (N treatment), a 0.5M solution of KH2PO4 (P treatment), a combination of N and P; or unamended agar for the control. Seven replicates of each treatment (control, N, P, and N+P) will be secured to frames and incubated in riffle habitat units for 21 days. Samples will then be analyzed for chlorophyll a and Ash Free Dry Mass (AFDM) using analysis of variance models (ANOVA). The results from the NDS experiments will help to characterize and assess nutrient limitation in study streams, which can inform decisions on nutrient enrichment treatments for nutrient limited streams in the upper Salmon River subbasin.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to evaluate macro-nutrient limitation in streams using Nutrient Diffusing Substrata (NDS) and analyze the results using ANOVA.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the availability of riffle habitat units, the need for precise measurements and calibration of equipment, and the time required to incubate and analyze samples. Additionally, the study is limited to evaluating macro-nutrient limitation, specifically nitrogen and phosphorus, and does not consider other potential limiting factors. The study also relies on the assumption that the NDS accurately represent nutrient availability in the study streams.
