2. Abstract: This method outlines the process of evaluating the health and level of disturbance of a stream corridor through semi-quantitative assessment of riparian vegetation. Based on an EMAP protocol for western wadable streams, it expands upon an existing canopy cover measurement method. The procedure involves visual estimation of various types of riparian vegetation within a 10m x 10m plot on each side of the stream, upstream and downstream from 11 cross-section transects. This method helps in understanding the impact of riparian vegetation on stream health and disturbance levels, providing valuable insights for conservation efforts.

3. Description: The method derives from an Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) protocol developed for monitoring western wadable streams, with a focus on enhancing the Canopy Cover Measurements outlined in the EMAP protocol. It provides visual estimation procedures to semi-quantitatively evaluate different types of riparian vegetation, contributing to an assessment of the health and level of disturbance within the stream corridor. These data also indicate present and future potential for various organic inputs and shading. The method further includes descriptions of legacy trees and invasive riparian plants in Sections 7.5.9 and 8, respectively. Observations are made on the riparian area upstream 5 meters and downstream 5 meters from each of the 11 cross-section transects. The visible area from the stream back a distance of 10m (-30 ft) shoreward from both the left and right banks is considered, creating a 10 m x 10 m riparian plot on each side of the stream. Riparian plot dimensions are estimated rather than measured, with adjusted boundaries on steeply sloping channel margins.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to evaluate the health and disturbance levels of a stream corridor by assessing various types of riparian vegetation using semi-quantitative visual estimation procedures.

5. Constraints: This method requires visual observations, which might be subjective and dependent on observer experience; it also involves estimating dimensions rather than measuring them directly, which may introduce some level of inaccuracy.
