2. Abstract: The RBT is a suite of Geographic Information System (GIS) tools designed to work within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software for analyzing river channels. Developed by North Arrow Research in association with ESSA and the Rocky Mountain Research Station, it allows users to derive high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from airborne remote sensing methods such as LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys. The RBT provides a comprehensive set of tools for describing and measuring river channels, including detrending DEMs, cutting cross sections, defining hydraulic geometry, computing stream gradient and sinuosity, mapping longitudinal variations in channel geometry metrics, varying water levels to investigate water depths and off-channel habitats, and identifying fish habitats.

3. Description: The RBT (River Bathymetry Toolkit) is a collection of GIS tools designed for use within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software that allows users to analyze river channels using high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). These DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing methods such as LiDAR or ground-based topographic surveys. The RBT enables users to detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope, cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM, define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section (such as bankfull width/depth), compute stream gradient and sinuosity, map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics, vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow, locate residual pools which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS add-in, requiring ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software as a prerequisite for its usage. The CHaMP - Topographic Point Collection Methods provides background information on the collection of measurement data that are analyzed using this calculation.

4. Target: River Channel Analysis and Measurement

5. Constraints: Requires ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software as a prerequisite for its usage. The accuracy and quality of analysis depend on the precision and availability of DEMs, which in turn rely on the quality and resolution of LiDAR or topographic survey data.
