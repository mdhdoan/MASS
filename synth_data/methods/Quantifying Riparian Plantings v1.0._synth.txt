2. Abstract: This method outlines a protocol to monitor the success of a habitat restoration project funded by the SRFB. The project involves planting vegetation along a riparian corridor, and this protocol will assess the survival, condition, growth, and cover provided by these plantings. The target density of trees is 400-700 trees per acre, but it is expected that after 3-5 years, 50% or more may be lost due to competition, browsing, or other factors. By comparing the tree density at the end of the study (approximately 200 trees per acre) with the initial target density, the effectiveness of the restoration project can be evaluated.
3. Description: The text describes a post-habitat restoration monitoring protocol for assessing the success of vegetative plantings along a riparian corridor. The intent is to trace the survival, condition, growth, and cover provided by the riparian plantings. The plantings may consist of evergreen and deciduous tree and shrub species that are tolerant of riparian areas. In reforestation areas, tree densities of 400-700 trees per acre are commonly used at the time of planting. However, it is anticipated that tree loss will occur, and after 3-5 years, 50% or more may have succumbed to competition, browsing, or some other effect. Normal timberlands in the Pacific Northwest thinned for wood production will contain 30 trees/acre for Douglas fir and up to 60 trees per acre for planted hemlock and alder. To test the effectiveness of the restoration project over a relatively short period of ten years, it is expected that there will be approximately 200 trees per acre at the end of the study.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to evaluate the success of a habitat restoration project by monitoring the survival, condition, growth, and cover provided by vegetative plantings along a riparian corridor.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need for regular monitoring over a period of ten years and the potential loss of trees due to competition, browsing, or other factors. Additionally, the success of the restoration project will be evaluated based on a target density of 200 trees per acre at the end of the study, which may not fully restore the habitat to its original state.
