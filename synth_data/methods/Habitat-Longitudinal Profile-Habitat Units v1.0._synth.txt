2. Abstract: This method involves conducting detailed surveys of river channels using longitudinal profiles at regular intervals between transects. The main channel's thalweg is followed to assess various features such as habitat type, depth, and presence of side channels or inactive habitats. By adopting the NWIFC definition of secondary habitat units, this method identifies areas that are less than 50% of the wetted width in conjunction with primary units (greater than 50% of the wetted width). This approach aims to increase efficiency by incorporating habitat unit identification with long-profile measurements. Additionally, large woody debris (LWD) is counted during the survey process.
3. Description: Longitudinal profiles are performed along the main channel at equal intervals, following the thalweg for consistent measurement. Habitat type, pool maximum depth, crested depth, and presence of side channels or inactive habitats are recorded for each longitudinal point. The method uses the NWIFC definition of secondary habitat units (units less than 50% of the wetted width) which occur together with primary units (greater than 50% of the wetted width). Surveyors and recorders collaborate to efficiently measure LWD while moving upstream between transects. Substrate size class measurements are taken at secondary transects as part of the longitudinal profile, offering an alternative method for identifying discrete habitat units.
4. Target: To improve efficiency in surveying river channels and their habitats by incorporating long-profile measurements with detailed habitat assessments.
5. Constraints: This method requires a well-coordinated team of surveyors and recorders to efficiently collect data on LWD, habitat types, and depths. Additionally, the method assumes a certain level of expertise in interpreting river channels' thalweg and understanding the NWIFC definition of secondary habitat units.
