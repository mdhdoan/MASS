2. Abstract:
The objective of this method is to determine the average bankfull width for a river reach. This information is crucial in understanding the hydraulic and geomorphic properties of river systems, as well as their response to environmental changes. The method involves identifying the bankfull interval, measuring the width at various points along the reach, and calculating the mean value. This approach provides a standardized and objective way of estimating bankfull width, which can be used for comparison across different reaches and rivers.

3. Description:
To determine the average bankfull width for a river reach, the first step is to identify the bankfull interval, which is defined as the "highest level to which a stream flows regularly under natural conditions" (Leopold et al., 1964). This can be done through various methods, such as visual inspection, topographic maps, or aerial photographs. Once the bankfull interval has been identified, the width of the channel is measured at regular intervals along the reach. These measurements are then used to calculate the mean value, which represents the average bankfull width for the reach. This method can be applied to different types of river systems and under various environmental conditions, making it a versatile tool for understanding the behavior of rivers.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to estimate the average bankfull width for a river reach, which provides valuable information about the hydraulic and geomorphic properties of the system.

5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is the need for accurate identification of the bankfull interval, which can be challenging in some cases, especially if the channel is heavily modified or if there are multiple channels present. Another constraint is the spatial resolution of the data used to measure the width, which can affect the accuracy and precision of the results. Finally, this method assumes that the reach is relatively homogeneous in terms of its hydraulic and geomorphic properties, which may not always be the case.
