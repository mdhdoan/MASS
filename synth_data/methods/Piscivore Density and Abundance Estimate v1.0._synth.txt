2. Abstract: This text describes a new method for estimating the abundance of predators in a section of the Columbia River. The authors propose to use hierarchical Bayesian modeling, which allows them to incorporate variability and uncertainty in their estimates. The new approach addresses previous limitations in traditional methods that required simplifying assumptions about fish density and lacked empirical validation. To increase precision, the study area will be stratified based on general flow characteristics, with observed fish densities used to classify all nearshore habitat within each stratum. Mark-recapture will be employed for a random sample of habitat types in each stratum, while additional sites may be sampled using a single pass method to reduce variability in abundance estimates.

3. Description: The text discusses a hierarchal Bayesian modeling approach (Korman et al., 2016) as an alternative to traditional methods for estimating predator abundance in the Columbia River between Priest Rapids and McNary dams. Previous methods (Beamesderfer and Rieman, 1991) relied on simplifying assumptions about fish density in sampled and unsampled areas but lacked validation using empirical data. The new method aims to improve accuracy by accounting for heterogeneity in fish distribution across different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth, and velocity).

The study area will be stratified based on general flow characteristics to reduce variability and increase precision in abundance estimates. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture methods for a random sample of habitat types within each stratum. If necessary, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass method with adjustments made for the respective capture probability of the habitat class. For unsampled habitat units within each stratum, fish densities will be estimated based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to develop a robust and accurate approach for estimating predator abundance in large rivers like the Columbia River, taking into account heterogeneity in fish distribution across different habitat types and incorporating uncertainty through hierarchical Bayesian modeling.

5. Constraints: The success of this method depends on several factors, including the availability of empirical data on fish densities from various habitat types, accurate classification of all nearshore habitats within each stratum, reliable mark-recapture estimates for a random sample of habitat types in each stratum, and appropriate capture probability adjustments for additional sites sampled using the single pass method.
