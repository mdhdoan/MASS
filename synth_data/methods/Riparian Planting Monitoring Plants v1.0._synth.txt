 1. Keywords: Stream channel incision, riparian vegetation, revegetation, herbivory, monitoring.

2. Abstract: This method outlines the process of monitoring woody riparian revegetation in a small, incised stream system located in a semi-arid region of the Pacific Northwest. The necessity for this method arises from the common problem of stream channel incision in such regions, which often results in the loss of ecologically important riparian vegetation. By monitoring tree stakes planted in riparian areas annually, this method allows for the assessment of impacts of various factors on growth and survivorship, thereby improving future restoration practices.

3. Description: The text describes a method for monitoring woody riparian revegetation in a small, incised stream system in a semi-arid region of the Pacific Northwest. This method is necessary due to the common problem of stream channel incision in such regions, which often results in the loss of riparian vegetation. Riparian vegetation plays a crucial role in altering processes such as sedimentation and erosion, providing important habitat for fish and wildlife, and enhancing adjacent habitats. Therefore, revegetation is a common activity undertaken in river and stream restoration projects across the United States.

This method focuses on monitoring tree stakes planted in riparian areas annually in the spring to assess the impacts of herbivory, different herbivory protection structures, spatial location, and plant species on growth and survivorship. The locations of riparian tree stakes are assumed to have been recorded at the time of initial planting, and trees are labeled with an identifying tag. This method utilizes a database on a tablet device for field data collection, although paper datasheets could also be used effectively for monitoring a small restoration project.

4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to monitor woody riparian revegetation in a small, incised stream system located in a semi-arid region of the Pacific Northwest, with the aim of assessing the impacts of various factors on growth and survivorship to improve future restoration practices.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the necessity for accurate recording of riparian tree stake locations at the time of initial planting and the use of identifying tags for each tree. Additionally, the success of this method relies on annual monitoring in the spring, which may be limited by factors such as weather conditions or accessibility to the site.
