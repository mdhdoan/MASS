2. Geomorphic heterogeneity
3. Aquatic habitat
4. Human activities impact
5. Large wood computations

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
This method outlines the process for calculating large wood frequency and volume in a river or stream reach. Large wood plays an important role in providing habitat and structuring channel morphology, with even small pieces contributing to geomorphic heterogeneity and aquatic biodiversity. However, human activities can limit the production, recruitment, and storage of large wood within these systems. By accurately measuring and quantifying large wood, researchers and managers can better understand its impact on aquatic ecosystems and make informed decisions regarding its management.

3. Description:
The text describes the importance of large wood in structuring channel morphology and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Climate and ecosystem capacity affect the relative role of large wood, while human activities such as timber harvesting, grazing, and channelization can limit its production, recruitment, and storage. Large wood can serve as both an indicator and a covariate in aquatic systems. The method for calculating large wood frequency and volume is provided, which remains consistent regardless of the application.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to accurately measure and quantify large wood frequency and volume in a river or stream reach.

5. Constraints:
This method assumes that the necessary data for calculating large wood frequency and volume is available. Additionally, it may be challenging to accurately measure large wood in systems with high flow velocities or limited accessibility. Finally, human activities such as timber harvesting, grazing, and channelization can make it difficult to accurately assess large wood in certain areas.
