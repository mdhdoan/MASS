  "abstractText": "Invasive species are increasingly becoming a matter of concern. In the Pacific Northwest. Species such as the New Zealand mud snail have been detected in stream systems of nine Western states (including Oregons Columbia River estuary) and are steadily expanding their range. Because of the spatial extent to which the field crews travel, the potential to serve as a vector for exotic species and diseases is great. AREMP has proactively developed this protocol as a mechanism to reduce the potential for spreading exotic species and diseases. The procedures that follow assume that all appropriate field gear starts each trip into the field in a clean (disinfected) state.",
