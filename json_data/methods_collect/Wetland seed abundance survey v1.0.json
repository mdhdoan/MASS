  "abstractText": "Moist soil management is a valuable tool for the managing of wetland habitats and the wildlife species associated with wetlands. The ability to manage water levels, create disturbance, and manipulate vegetation to allow for more productive early successionalwetland habitats is crucial to the TD-1 project.  Moist soil management provides critical habitat and food sources for wetland obligate and wetland associated species, while also allowing for valuable recreation opportunities. During April and May of 2017 Columbia Basin Wildlife Area staff harrowed and seeded four wetland cells, harrowed one wetland cell and left unseeded, and left one wetland cell un-harrowed and unseeded in the Desert Project 1. All cells had varying degrees of soil moisture and composition allowing WDFW staff to assess where seeding is most beneficial. Wetland cells that were seeded had Proso Millet,Wild Millet, and Smartweed planted. Millet planted was spread by a broadcast seeder at the rate of 20 lbs. /acre and Smartweed as mixed in with the Millet at the rate of 10 lbs. /acre. WDFW staff has always seen the benefit in seeding wetlands and providing food sources for migrating waterfowl. However, information on how seeded wetlands versus naturally establishing wetlands compare had not been investigated. Through this analysis, we hoped to gain the data to support that seeded wetlands are producing more seed biomass of desirable plant species.",
