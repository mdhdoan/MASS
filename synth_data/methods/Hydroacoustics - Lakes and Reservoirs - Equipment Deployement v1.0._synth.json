  "abstract": " Hydroacoustics is a non-invasive method used to study fish populations underwater without disturbing their habitats or the fish themselves. It provides detailed maps of fish densities and sizes across large bodies of water, making it particularly useful for areas with patchy fish distribution. The method uses sound waves that are not typically detected by most fish species, allowing for efficient and cost-effective data collection. However, hydroacoustics has some limitations such as inability to identify target species using single frequency systems and difficulty discerning modes in length-frequency distributions with side-looking mobile systems. Recognizing these limitations, hydroacoustics is best used in conjunction with other sampling methods like purse seining for a comprehensive survey of fish populations, providing valuable information on size, density, and distribution."

  "description": " Hydroacoustics is a non-destructive underwater technology used for quantifying fish densities and mean sizes across large water bodies (MacLennan & Simmonds, 1992; Brandt, 1996). The primary advantage of hydroacoustics lies in its ability to survey the entire water column without disturbing the habitat or fish population. This method is particularly beneficial for areas where spatial patchiness in fish distribution poses challenges for traditional sampling methods such as purse-seine hauls (Hubert, 1996).\n\nSonar systems used in hydroacoustic surveys typically employ frequencies between 38 to 200 kHz, which are generally undetectable by most fish species except a few exceptions (Mann et al., 2001; Gregory & Clabburn, 2003). As the sampling area increases, variability in density estimates across acoustic transects is typically reduced compared to other gear types.\n\nHowever, hydroacoustics does present certain limitations in terms of data collection. Single frequency hydroacoustic surveys cannot identify specific target species (Fernandes et al., 2003). Side-looking mobile hydroacoustic systems may not distinguish modes within length-frequency distributions if significant differences in length classes do not exist.\n\nDespite these limitations, hydroacoustic sampling remains a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods such as creel surveys or catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU) measures (Hubert, 1996). When combined with active sampling gears like purse seining, hydroacoustics offers a comprehensive survey method capable of providing valuable information on target size, population densities, and spatial distribution.\n\nTo better understand the underlying principles of hydroacoustic surveys, let us delve deeper into some of the terminologies used in the text:\n\n1. Water column: The vertical extent of water from the surface to the bottom. Hydroacoustics enables us to assess fish densities across the entire water column.\n2. Spatial patchiness: The irregular distribution of fish populations within a given area. Traditional sampling methods, such as purse-seine hauls, may encounter difficulties in areas with high spatial patchiness. Hydroacoustics alleviates this issue by providing an unbiased estimate of fish densities across larger areas.\n3. Frequency band: A range of frequencies used in a sonar system. In the context of hydroacoustic surveys, the standard frequency band ranges from 38 to 200 kHz. Most fish species are not sensitive to these frequencies.\n4. Target species: The specific fish or organism being surveyed. Single frequency hydroacoustic surveys cannot identify target species but multifrequency and broadband sonar systems show promise in discerning species in low-diversity systems.\n5. Side-looking mobile hydroacoustics: A hydroacoustic system that provides detailed information about the water column by emitting sounds and analyzing the returning echoes. It cannot distinguish modes within length-frequency distributions unless large differences in length classes exist.\n6. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU): A method used to estimate fish populations based on the number of fish caught per unit of effort, such as time or gear usage. The estimates developed from this method may not necessarily be directly proportional to fish density.\n7. Comprehensive survey method: An approach that combines multiple sampling techniques to provide a more accurate representation of the population being surveyed. In this context, hydroacoustics is used in conjunction with purse seining or other active sampling gears for a more comprehensive assessment of fish populations."
