2. Abstract: This method describes the use of gill nets, a passive fishing gear, for sampling juvenile white sturgeon in the Columbia River Basin. Gill nets are an effective sampling gear for assessing natural recruitment and evaluating hatchery supplementation efforts. The document outlines the deployment and retrieval of gill nets using hydraulic gill net drums mounted on 7 to 10 meter vessels, with a focus on targeting sub-yearling (age 0) white sturgeon using small-mesh gill nets.
3. Description: Gill nets are a type of passive fishing gear made up of a panel of mesh netting. They work by capturing fish that swim into the netting and become wedged, gilled, or entangled. The design and construction of gill nets can vary to target specific species and sizes of fish, as well as to accommodate different water body and vessel sizes. In the context of this method, gill nets are used primarily for sampling juvenile white sturgeon in the Columbia River Basin. Small-mesh (5.1 cm stretch mesh webbing) gill nets are specifically used to target sub-yearling (age 0) white sturgeon. The document outlines the steps for deploying and retrieving these gill nets using hydraulic gill net drums mounted on 7 to 10 meter vessels.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is the use of gill nets for sampling juvenile white sturgeon in the Columbia River Basin.
5. Constraints: The use of gill nets for sampling juvenile white sturgeon in the Columbia River Basin requires vessels with specialized net deployment and retrieval equipment, as well as gill nets of appropriate mesh size and type. Additionally, this method is limited to the use of hydraulic gill net drums mounted on 7 to 10 meter vessels.
