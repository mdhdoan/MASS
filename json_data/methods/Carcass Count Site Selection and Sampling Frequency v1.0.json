  "abstractText": "Most adult anadromous salmon die shortly after returning from the sea to spawn in their natal streams. Salmon carcasses provide important information to scientists, including scales, tissue samples, length measurements, and population sex composition data. With marked fish, carcass recoveries offer a mechanism to support markrecapture population assessments. Carcass counts are often done in conjunction with foot-based visual counts of spawning fish and with redd counts.",
