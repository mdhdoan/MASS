  "abstractText": "The presence of fin marks and tags can help to identify individual fish, or can help to show that the fish is used for a purpose. The presence of coded-wire tags and adipose fin clips usually identify that the fish is of hatchery origin. Understanding the origin of a fish can help to describe the proportion of hatchery fish in a population. Furthermore, if your project is focused on one production type, ether hatchery or natural, marks and tags can increase efficiency and reduce handling time of natural fish. The absence of any mark or tag usually indicates that the fish if natural origin.",
