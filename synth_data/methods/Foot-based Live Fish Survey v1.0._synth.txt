2. Abstract: This method focuses on accurately estimating the number of spawning adult salmonids in their natal streams to monitor population abundance and ensure it aligns with management objectives. Spawner counts are ideally replicated weekly throughout the spawning period, with more frequent surveys providing better accuracy. Streamflow, turbidity, and other factors can influence count accuracy; however, counts can be conducted visually during spawning as fish dig egg nests (redds) and mate. This method is primarily used in regions with developed road networks, such as southern British Columbia and Japan.
3. Description: The necessity of accurate spawner counts arises from the importance of adult spawner abundance as a primary population measurement for many salmonid populations. These counts enable estimation of potential egg deposition, helping to manage and monitor species' abundance in relation to escapement goals or other management objectives. As salmonids enter rivers or streams over an extended period, continuous mortality (for salmon) and/or emigration (for steelhead) make it challenging to obtain accurate spawner estimates. To improve accuracy, weekly replication of counts throughout the spawning period is recommended, with more frequent surveys providing better precision. Streamflow, turbidity, and other factors can impact count accuracy; however, clear streams in many regions allow for visual counting of spawning fish as they create redds and engage in mating activities. Counts are often conducted on foot or from a boat, focusing on steelhead and chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus mykiss, O. tshawytscha), chum salmon (O. keta), and coho salmon (O. kisutch). In addition to supporting spawning escapement estimates, live fish counts can describe spawning timing, particularly when combined with redd and carcass counts.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a reliable technique for estimating the abundance of adult spawning salmonids in their natal streams by conducting accurate spawner counts throughout the spawning period.
5. Constraints: This method requires accessible waterways, suitable stream conditions (e.g., low turbidity), and developed road networks for efficient access to various sites. The timing of spawning activities may also present challenges, as counts often need to be conducted under suboptimal conditions.
