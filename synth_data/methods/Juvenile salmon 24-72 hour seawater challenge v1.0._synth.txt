2. Abstract: Smoltification is a critical process for salmonids to adapt from freshwater to seawater environments. A common method to evaluate smolt development is the seawater challenge test. This test involves immersing a set number of fish in artificial seawater and monitoring mortality over 24, 48, or 72 hours. By repeating this test monthly, it documents the change in the proportion of seawater-adapted (smolted) fish within a population or treatment group, providing valuable insights into their physiological readiness for migration and environmental adaptability.
3. Description: Smoltification is a complex process that involves physical, biological, and behavioral changes in salmonids to enable seawater adaptation (Folmar and Dickhoff, 1980). The seawater challenge test is a widely adopted method for evaluating smolt development, with various protocols adapted for different species and life-history types (Clarke and Blackburn, 1977). A typical procedure immerses 15-25 fish from a test group in a static bath of artificial seawater at 30-37ppt, providing air. Mortality is recorded after predetermined intervals (24, 48, or 72 hours), and the test is repeated monthly to track changes in seawater adaptability within a population or treatment group over time.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to assess the smolt development and readiness for migration by evaluating their ability to survive in seawater conditions.
5. Constraints: This method requires access to artificial seawater, appropriate testing facilities, and a consistent monitoring process to ensure accurate mortality recordings over specific time intervals. Monthly repetition of the test can be resource-intensive, particularly when dealing with larger sample sizes or limited facility availability.
