  "abstractText": "Minimum elevation and Water Residence Time (WRT) are derived to describe extent of the annual drawdownand compare between years.Deeper drawdowns greatly reduce the surface area of Lake Roosevelt and dewater near-shore habitats. Theyresult in an altered hydrologic system with characteristics more riverine than lacustrine including elevated TDG levels, increased nutrient flux, shorter WRT and reduced water clarity and primary and secondary production.",
