2. Abstract:
This method details the process of analyzing water table elevation data to assess restoration project outcomes. By comparing changes in water table elevation between reference and treated sites, this approach helps determine if restoration work is achieving its goals. The procedure involves summarizing and graphically displaying data, followed by applying a linear mixed model time series analysis to understand the effect of treatment on the restored site. While this method specifically focuses on seven-day maximum, minimum, and mean water table elevation, groundwater temperature data analysis is discussed separately.

3. Description:
The method begins by describing the purpose of analyzing water table elevation data, which is to detect changes resulting from restoration activities such as floodplain reconnection projects. The procedure assumes that data has been collected in both reference and treated sites with a minimum resolution of one reading per hour or two hours for the monitoring period. 

Two main parts make up this method: (1) summarizing and graphically displaying data, and (2) utilizing a linear mixed model time series analysis to determine the effect of treatment on the restored site. The first part involves generating summary statistics and visual representations for seven-day maximum, minimum, and mean water table elevation.

The second part employs a linear mixed model time series analysis, which allows for more accurate results compared to traditional methods despite potential data irregularities. This technique can account for missing or inconsistent data points while estimating treatment effects over time. 

Although this method primarily addresses water table elevation analysis, it acknowledges the significance of groundwater temperature data and refers users to a separate method for its examination.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is comparing changes in water table elevation between reference and treated sites to evaluate restoration project success.

5. Constraints:
This method assumes that data has been collected using Onset HOBO U20 Water Level Loggers installed as part of a restoration monitoring design. Adapting the procedure for different data collection methods or equipment might require modifications not covered in this text body.
