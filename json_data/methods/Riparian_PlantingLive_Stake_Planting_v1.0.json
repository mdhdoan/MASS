  "abstractText": "All live stake materials should be transported from cold storage to the restoration site in 3  4 batches. Batches should arrive 24 hours prior to being needed for planting so that live stakes can soak in water for 24 hours prior to planting. Batches should provide a representative mix of cottonwood and willow so that both species can be randomly distributed within the planting areas. Using a motorized auger, drill within the riparian areas identified in the planting maps that fall within three vertical feet of the stream bed base elevation or where wet/moist soils. Holes should be spaced roughly 6  10 feet apart. For each plant, confirm that the soil at the bottom of the drilled hole is wet or moist and insert a live stake that has been cut at a 45 angle just below the bottom-most node and a 90 angle approximately 22 cm above the ground. Backfill the soil until it is level with the surrounding ground. Record the species (record genus, species, and variant if known), date of planting.",
