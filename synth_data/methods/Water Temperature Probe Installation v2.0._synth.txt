 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the keywords I've identified from the text body:

1. Large rocks or boulders
2. Immobile during floods
3. Relatively flat downstream attachment surface
4. Low-gradient meadow reaches
5. Sensor installation

Now, let's move on to the other sections you've requested:

2. Abstract:
The method described in the text focuses on the importance of finding a suitable rock for sensor installation in a low-gradient meadow reach. The necessity of this method arises from the need to find a stable and immobile structure that can withstand floods, provide a flat surface for attachment, and remain submerged for an entire year. By identifying large rocks or boulders as suitable structures, this method aims to ensure successful sensor installation and data collection in these environments.
3. Description:
The text provides detailed guidance on how to identify a suitable rock for sensor installation. It emphasizes the importance of finding a large rock that is immobile during floods and easy to identify for subsequent site visits. The ideal rock should be wide enough to shield the sensor from moving rocks or debris, and have a relatively flat downstream attachment surface that is deep enough to remain submerged in flowing water for the entire year. The text also advises against attaching sensors to large logs as they may decay over time. In low-gradient meadow reaches where large substrates suitable for attachment are rare, the method suggests seeking steeper channels immediately up or downstream of the meadow.
4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to ensure successful sensor installation in low-gradient meadow reaches by finding a suitable rock or boulder as an immobile structure for attachment.
5. Constraints:
The constraints of this method include the availability and accessibility of large rocks or boulders that are immobile during floods, have a relatively flat downstream attachment surface, and remain submerged for an entire year. In low-gradient meadow reaches where such rocks are rare, the constraint is finding suitable steep channels immediately up or downstream of the meadow. Another constraint is the need to avoid large logs as potential structures for sensor attachment due to their likelihood of decaying over time.
