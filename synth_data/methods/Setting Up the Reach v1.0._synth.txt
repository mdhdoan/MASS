2. Abstract: This method explains how to determine the reach length by averaging 5 bankfull widths. This is an important step to take after confirming that the reach can be sampled and collecting necessary water quality data. The use of this method ensures standardization in determining reach length for various purposes such as hydrologic studies or environmental impact assessments.
3. Description: According to the AIM Protocol or Method 7012 Water Quality, after confirming that the reach is sampleable and collecting water quality data, one needs to determine the reach length using the average of 5 bankfull widths. This process allows for a consistent method in determining the reach length which can be used for various applications. The AIM Protocol or Method 7012 Water Quality provides detailed guidelines on how to collect water quality data and ensure that the reach is sampleable.
4. Target: To calculate the reach length using the average of 5 bankfull widths.
5. Constraints: This method can only be used after confirming that the reach is sampleable and collecting water quality data, as outlined in Section 5 of the AIM Protocol or Method 7012 Water Quality.
