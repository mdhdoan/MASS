2. Abstract: The standard length method is a technique used to measure the length of a fish from the anterior-most extreme of its head to the posterior margin of its hypural bone, which forms a notch when the caudal peduncle is flexed. This method is an alternative when the maximum total length or fork length methods cannot be used due to damaged or deformed caudal fins.
3. Description: The standard length method is a way of measuring fish that involves bending the caudal peduncle to create a notch, which indicates the posterior margin of the hypural bone. This measurement is taken from the anterior-most extreme of the head, with the jaw closed, to the notch created by flexing the caudal peduncle. The purpose of this method is to obtain an accurate measurement of the fish's length when the maximum total length or fork length methods cannot be used due to damaged or deformed caudal fins. This method was developed by Anderson and Gutreuter in 1983 and has been widely adopted in the field of fish biology.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide an alternative way of measuring the length of a fish when traditional methods are not possible due to damaged or deformed caudal fins.
5. Constraints: This method can only be used if the fish specimen has damaged or deformed caudal fins, preventing the use of the maximum total length or fork length methods.
