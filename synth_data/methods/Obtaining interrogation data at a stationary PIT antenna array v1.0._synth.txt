2. Abstract: PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) technology and the use of stationary antenna arrays have become an effective method for monitoring the movement of salmonids. This approach is non-intrusive, cost-effective, and time-efficient. After the initial installation, maintenance requirements are minimal, making it a practical solution for long-term monitoring. Data collected from interrogated fish at a site is accurately recorded with timestamps and can be easily accessed through interfacing with the receiver using a computer or PDA.

3. Description: The research discusses the implementation of PIT technology, specifically focusing on stationary antenna arrays for monitoring salmonids. This method offers several advantages over traditional monitoring techniques. Firstly, it is minimally intrusive as interrogation of PIT tagged fish does not require additional recapture events. Secondly, after installing the stationary arrays, operation and maintenance do not demand significant time investments; the initial investment in equipment is offset by the low cost of maintenance and operation. Data from interrogated fish at a site is time-stamped and logged on the receiver. To collect this data, one can interface with the receiver using a computer or PDA, ensuring easy access to collected information.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide an efficient, non-intrusive, and cost-effective solution for monitoring salmonids' movement using PIT technology and stationary antenna arrays.

5. Constraints: While the PIT technology and stationary antenna arrays offer several benefits, there may be limitations such as the need for initial capital investment, potential limitations in detection range, and the requirement of specialized equipment and knowledge to implement the system.
