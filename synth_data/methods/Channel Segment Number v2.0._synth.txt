 1. Keywords: Channel identification, segment numbering, main channel, side channels, technical method.

2. Abstract: This method focuses on identifying and labeling the main channel and different types of side channels in a system. By assigning segment numbers to all channel units within the main channel and qualifying side channels, this approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the system's structure. The use of channel segment numbers helps distinguish the main channel from side channels, allowing for better analysis and decision-making processes.

3. Description: The text outlines a technical method aimed at identifying and labeling various channel types within a system. Channel segment numbers are used to differentiate between the main channel and qualifying side channels. This process involves assigning unique segment numbers to all channel units within both the main channel and side channels, enabling clear distinction and organization. The necessity of this method arises from the need for a more precise understanding of complex systems, which can help improve decision-making processes and overall performance.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to effectively identify and label various channel types within a system for better analysis and understanding.

5. Constraints: This method's constraints include the complexity of the system being analyzed and the accuracy of data collection, which directly impacts the ability to correctly identify and assign segment numbers to channels. Additionally, the effectiveness of this method may be limited in cases where channel units are not clearly defined or differentiated within a system.
