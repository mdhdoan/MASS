  "abstractText": "This method explains the general procedure for using juvenile salmon otoliths to reconstruct timing of marine entry and marine growth rates. It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all for this type of analysis and the use of some of the required instrumentation, such as the laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, requires training and supervision that cannot be fully explained in the step-by-step instructions below.",
