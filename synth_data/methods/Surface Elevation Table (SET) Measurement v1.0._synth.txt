2. Abstract: Surface Elevation Tables (SETs) are a precise method for measuring sediment accumulation rates and monitoring surface processes. By anchoring SETs to bedrock and utilizing marker horizons, researchers can differentiate between earth movement and surface accretion or erosion. This method is particularly useful in evaluating subsidence and sea level rise risks. Regular quarterly monitoring allows for the consideration of seasonal environmental factors' effects on these processes (Rogers et al., 2013).

3. Description: Surface Elevation Tables (SETs) are a highly accurate method for measuring sediment accretion rates, as they are anchored to bedrock and incorporate marker horizons to estimate surface processes. This approach enables the separation of earth movement processes from surface accretion or erosion, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms behind these phenomena. SETs are commonly employed to assess subsidence and sea level rise risks, which is crucial in coastal management and climate change studies. The method involves regular monitoring, typically on a quarterly basis, allowing researchers to gather data about seasonal environmental factors' impact on surface processes (Rogers et al., 2013).

4. Target: The primary focus of the SETs method is to accurately measure sediment accretion rates and evaluate subsidence and sea level rise risks by differentiating earth movement processes from surface accretion or erosion, accounting for seasonal environmental factors.

5. Constraints: Although Surface Elevation Tables are a highly accurate method, their implementation may be limited by factors such as accessibility to bedrock, the need for consistent monitoring, and potential disturbances caused by human activities or extreme weather events. Moreover, the complexity of the data analysis and interpretation process could pose a constraint for non-specialist users.
