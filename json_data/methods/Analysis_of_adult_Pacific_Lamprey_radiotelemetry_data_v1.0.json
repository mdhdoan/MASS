  "abstractText": "Radiotelemetry has been used widely to document passage efficiency of anadromous fishes withinmainstem rivers, tributaries, and at barriers within these environments. The data are used to evaluate structural and operational modifications made to improve passage success of adult Pacific Lampreyat mainstem and tributary dams. Fixed-site receivers are strategically positioned to detect radio-tagged fish passing at specific areas of interest in the fishways. The resulting detections are then used to document passage success, passage duration, and timing of fish movements. The original fishway design and sub-sequent modifications have focused on maximizing salmonid passage efficiencies. However, fishes that do not share salmonid migration behaviors may not respond positively to these configurations.",
