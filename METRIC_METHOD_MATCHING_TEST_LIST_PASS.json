Tern bands resighted by the public or by other, non-project staff at sites throughout North America can be reported via www.mybandedtern.org, a web site dedicated to previously banded Caspian terns. A similar web site for double-crested cormorants may also soon be available. Additional details about banding efforts and the data derived from them can be found in Suzuki (2012)."

Avian predation rates can then be calculated based on the percentage of PIT-tagged juvenile salmonids released and/or detected passing hydroelectric dams that are subsequently consumed and deposited by birds on their nesting colonies. Because each PIT tag represents a unique fish, the tag recovery approach allows the testing of hypotheses on the effects of smolt morphology, condition, abundance, and origin on smolt vulnerability to avian predation."

            "Beach and pole seining can be an efficient method to capture fishes in a wide variety of habitats, including rivers, estuarine, and nearshore lake, reservoir, and marine habitats (Pierce et al. 1990). It is most effective when used in relatively shallow water with few obstructions, where fish are in high concentrations, and for species that are less likely to outswim the net; however, in some circumstances seining can capture highly mobile species such as adult salmon. Seining permits the sampling of relatively large areas in short periods of time as well as the capture and release of fish without significant stress or harm, as long as the bunt of the seine is kept in water and the fish are not too crowded (or fish are quickly moved to a holding container). Cost of gear, boats, and personnel range from relatively inexpensive to modest, depending on the scope and frequency of sampling.Seining may be carried out in a variety of habitat types, depending on the population and life stage of the targeted species. Sites with irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, or dense stands of aquatic vegetation may not be suitable for seining due to net snagging or lifting and reduced fish retention. Current velocity and depth influence site selection and choice of net design. Seines vary in size and design. To help understand what affects selectivity and capture efficiencyand therefore, effectiveness of seiningwe considered the following categories: habitat, water, fish, time of year and day, net, and method. Considering these factors in your study design before you sample and after you begin sampling (by underwater observation and calibration studies) will help you to decide when seining may be a good technique to meet your objectives; it will also help improve the analysis of data collected.Perpendicular set beach seining may be used for fish/area or fish/volume analysis (length, width, and depth must be measured), but fish/set is appropriate only if the distance pulled is consistent. The poles may be marked with 0.1-m-depth increments to facilitate measuring the water depth at the offshore end of the seine (note: take an average of two or more depths). To ensure consistent width of swept area, a rope of known length can be attached to the upper end of each pole (DE in Figure 1) and stretched tight during seining."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

The thalweg profile is a longitudinal survey of maximum flow path depth and several other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points (termed stations) along the length of the support reach measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from the thalweg profile allows calculation of indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools. This habitat assessment modifies traditional methods by measuring upstream distance in the middle of the channel, rather than along the thalweg itself (though each thalweg depth measurement is taken at the point of the deepest flow path at each station).Overview: method activities/data collected1.

This is a relatively flat, depositional area that is commonly vegetated and above the bankfull elevation.ii. Examine depositional features such as point bars. The highest elevation of a point bar usually indicates the lowest possible elevation for bankfull stage. However, depositional features can form both above and below the bankfull elevation when unusual flows occur during years preceding the survey. Large floods can form bars that extend above bankfull whereas several years of low flows can result in bars forming below bankfull elevation.iii. A break in slope of the banks and/or change in the particle size distribution from coarser bed load particles to finer particles deposited during bank overflow conditions.iv.

            "Monitoring the health and long-term stability of bird communities can provide an important measure of overall environmental health and (Smits and Fernie 2012) effectiveness of management decisions (Noson and Hutto 2005). Birds are good environmental monitors for several reasons: many species can be monitored simultaneously with a single method, methods for monitoring are well understood and standardized, birds occupy all habitat types, and as a community represent several trophic levels and habitat use guilds. Monitoring species abundance, community diversity, and trends provides information that can be used to determine the effectiveness of management actions in moving towards restoration goals.Point counts are the most widely used quantitative method used for monitoring land birds and involve an observer recording birds from a single point for a standardized time period (Ralph et al. 1995). The methodology follows recommendations by Ralph et al. (1995) and is consistent with that employed by the USDA Forest Service Northern Region Land Bird Monitoring Project (Hutto et al. 2001) and recommendations for the Idaho Partners in Flight Bird Monitoring Plan (Leukering et al. 2000). Fixed-radius plots (where the radius is arbitrarily small) reduce the interspecific difference in detectability by assuming that: a) all the birds within the fixed-radius are detectable; b) observers do not actively attract or repel birds; and c) birds do not move into or out of the fixed-radius plot during the counting period. This allows for comparisons of abundance among species. Unlimited radius plots maximize the amount of data collected because they include all detections and are appropriate when the objective is to monitor population changes within a single population (Ralph et al. 1995). Birds should be tallied in two distance bands, one 0-50 meters from the point center and one >50 meters from the point center. This maximizes data collection while permitting interspecific analysis. Additional information on establishing point count stations, data collection, and sample data forms can be found in Ralph et al. (1993), Ralph et al. (1995), and Huff et al. (2000)."

            "Beach and pole seining can be an efficient method to capture fishes in a wide variety of habitats, including rivers, estuarine, and nearshore lake, reservoir, and marine habitats (Pierce et al. 1990). It is most effective when used in relatively shallow water with few obstructions, where fish are in high concentrations, and for species that are less likely to outswim the net; however, in some circumstances seining can capture highly mobile species such as adult salmon. Seining permits the sampling of relatively large areas in short periods of time as well as the capture and release of fish without significant stress or harm, as long as the bunt of the seine is kept in water and the fish are not too crowded (or fish are quickly moved to a holding container). Cost of gear, boats, and personnel range from relatively inexpensive to modest, depending on the scope and frequency of sampling.Seining may be carried out in a variety of habitat types, depending on the population and life stage of the targeted species. Sites with irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, or dense stands of aquatic vegetation may not be suitable for seining due to net snagging or lifting and reduced fish retention. Current velocity and depth influence site selection and choice of net design. Seines vary in size and design. To help understand what affects selectivity and capture efficiencyand therefore, effectiveness of seiningwe considered the following categories: habitat, water, fish, time of year and day, net, and method. Considering these factors in your study design before you sample and after you begin sampling (by underwater observation and calibration studies) will help you to decide when seining may be a good technique to meet your objectives; it will also help improve the analysis of data collected.Perpendicular set beach seining may be used for fish/area or fish/volume analysis (length, width, and depth must be measured), but fish/set is appropriate only if the distance pulled is consistent. The poles may be marked with 0.1-m-depth increments to facilitate measuring the water depth at the offshore end of the seine (note: take an average of two or more depths). To ensure consistent width of swept area, a rope of known length can be attached to the upper end of each pole (DE in Figure 1) and stretched tight during seining."

Monitoring species abundance, community diversity, and trends provides information that can be used to determine the effectiveness of management actions in moving towards restoration goals.Point counts are the most widely used quantitative method used for monitoring land birds and involve an observer recording birds from a single point for a standardized time period (Ralph et al. 1995).

Unlimited radius plots maximize the amount of data collected because they include all detections and are appropriate when the objective is to monitor population changes within a single population (Ralph et al. 1995).

Additional information on establishing point count stations, data collection, and sample data forms can be found in Ralph et al. (1993), Ralph et al. (1995), and Huff et al. (2000)."

An active channel will have some combination of the following bankfull indicators:i. Examine stream banks for an active floodplain. This is a relatively flat, depositional area that is commonly vegetated and above the bankfull elevation.ii. Examine depositional features such as point bars. The highest elevation of a point bar usually indicates the lowest possible elevation for bankfull stage. However, depositional features can form both above and below the bankfull elevation when unusual flows occur during years preceding the survey. Large floods can form bars that extend above bankfull whereas several years of low flows can result in bars forming below bankfull elevation.iii. A break in slope of the banks and/or change in the particle size distribution from coarser bed load particles to finer particles deposited during bank overflow conditions.iv. Locate the elevation where mature key riparian woody vegetation exists. The lowest elevation of birch, alder, and dogwood can be useful, whereas willows are often found below the bankfull elevation.v. Examine the ceiling of undercut banks. This elevation is usually slightly below the bankfull elevation.vi. Stream channels actively reform bankfull features such as floodplains after shifts or down cutting in the channel.

Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines.

            "The ability to see and count what is under the surface of the water without disturbing the habitat or the fish is a key advantage of hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can sample the entire water column quickly, and detailed maps of fish densities and mean sizes can be obtained over large bodies of water. As more area is encompassed by a sample, many of the sampling problems created by the spatial patchiness of fish distribution are alleviated. Thus, there tends to be less variation in density estimates across acoustic transects compared to purse-seine hauls or other gear types. Also, the frequency band used in scientific sonars (typically 38 to 200 kHz) is not detectable by most fishes (except see Mann et al. 2001; Gregory and Clabburn 2003). There remain limitations in the type of data that can be collected using hydroacoustics. Currently, single frequency hydroacoustics cannot identify the target species, though broadband and multifrequency sonar systems are showing promise in discerning species in low-diversity systems (Fernandes et al. 2003). Side-looking mobile hydroacoustics cannot discern modes in lengthfrequency distributions unless large differences in length classes exist. When these limitations are recognized, hydroacoustic sampling efforts are cost effective, as estimates from creel surveys are expensive and labor intensive, and the estimates developed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU) measures are not necessarily directly proportional to fish density (Hubert 1996:158159; Yule 2000). When used in concert with purse seining or other active sampling gears, hydroacoustics can provide a comprehensive survey method capable of providing valuable information on target size, population densities, and spatial distribution. Additional aspects of the strengths and limitations of acoustic surveys can be found in MacLennan and Simmonds (1992) and Brandt (1996)."

It is designed for arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, dominated by willow and shrub-steppe. This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor floodplain vegetation response before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation with increasing distance from the main channel. These methods can be completed in conjunction with the Floodplain Vegetation Monitoring Greenline Data Collection methods.In riparian areas, change is continuous due to flux in stream flow and sediment aggregation, resulting in pronounced changes in successional vegetation (Windward 2000). Monitoring the change in vegetation communities and at what distance these changes are occurring with respect to the main channel create a cross-section portrait of the riparian zone over time. Observing the relative abundance of hydric, riparian, and upland species with respect to distance from the main channel defines the extent and characterizes the riparian area with respect to local flora communities typical for the area (Crawford 2003). Over time, changes reveal whether floodplains are expanding and becoming further inundated as is shown to occur in the presence of damming high levels of beaver activity (Pollock, et al. 2014). In addition to measuring changes in vegetative composition and abundance at various distances from the main channel, these methods aid in tracking beaver forage radius and woody species recruitment rates at study sites with beaver activity.Transect data measurements are collected within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1), with the first quadrat beginning at the greenline, and 3-5 quadrat measurements within one transect. A transect is laid out starting at the greenline and distance along the transect is measured by walking away from the greenline, perpendicular to stream flow. The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton, T.A., S.J. Smith, and E.R. Cowley. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008)."

It is designed for arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, dominated by willow and shrub-steppe. This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor the greenline before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation at the greenline.Streamside vegetation and GGW are significant indicators of the levels of incision and riparian health (Burton et al. 2011). Because changes occur most rapidly at the greenline due to high levels of disturbance, greenline vegetation data can be used to make early management decisions (Winward 2000). There are a variety of stream health indicators that can be assessed, using the data metrics collected at the greenline. For example: the presence or absence of deep rooted perennial vegetation can indicate how susceptible the streambank is to erosion; the types of hydrophilic species present can indicate the successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity; the abundance of invasive exotic species found at the greenline (due to high levels of disturbance) can indicate the degree to which the area is susceptible to the establishment of invasive species. Measuring the GGW will provide a more general view into landscape level changes. Over time, changing GGW indicates the degree of sediment aggradation occurring to create a wider stream networks, a key component to improving habitat complexity within and along narrow, incised channels (Pollock et al. 2007) and how quickly this change is occurring.Greenline data measurements are collected in pairs, one on each side of the channel, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1). The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton et al. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008). The measurements taken within the quadrat, in conjunction with information about each quadrats location along the reach, can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization (browse), and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence."

            "Variable mesh gill nets are appropriate for sampling when fish mortality is not a limiting factor. Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993).

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Included in this method are instructions for collecting stream channel measurements. Thalweg refers to the flow path of the deepest water in a stream channel. The thalweg profile is a longitudinal survey of maximum flow path depth and several other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points (termed stations) along the length of the support reach measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from the thalweg profile allows calculation of indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools. This habitat assessment modifies traditional methods by measuring upstream distance in the middle of the channel, rather than along the thalweg itself (though each thalweg depth measurement is taken at the point of the deepest flow path at each station).Overview: method activities/data collected1. Measure wetted width.2. Classify the size of the bed surface particles.3. Measure depth of thalweg.4. Determine the channel unit code and pool forming element codes."

Field practitioners must physically walk each reach, using a GPS to geo-reference each habitat type, and afterwards post-process the GPS data to create a map of the reach. See method 6910 Habitat Type for field procedures.Habitat types are recorded in one of two formats, either as a polyline or a polygon and classified into channel pattern and type. The appropriate format is based upon the wetted/bankfull channel size and data collection precision and effort. The format chosen should be whichever of the two options will provide the most accurate representation of the relative habitat abundances for a stream section. In general, a polyline format is used on channels less than 20m bankfull width and a polygon format is used on larger channels. In some instances it may be appropriate to employ both formats during a single survey effort.All months are rated the same for this attribute, although it is recognized that the relative amount of this habitat type can change over a wide range of flow levels. When rating this attribute, a moderate flow level should be assumed. Habitat types are entered as a point estimate of the percentage of the stream reach wetted width for the particular habitat type."

However, river basins of the Northern Hemisphere host the highest number of non-native fish species and they represent more than a quarter of the total number of species(Leprieuret al. 2008). Non-native species can often become invasive species due to many factors including: the release from enemies (parasites/predators/etc.) or having novel weapons or traits that gives the invasive species an advantage in their introduced system (Torchin et al. 2003, Callaway and Ridenour 2004). Furthermore, invasive species can cost hundreds of billions of dollars annually to mitigate and maintain (Pimentel et al. 2005).Thus, the identificationof the fish to a species level is importantecologically and economically.Correct and complete recording of data is absolutely essential to the success of all long term resource monitoring programefforts (Ratcliff et al. 2014). Conversely, failure to comply with data recording procedures compromises the mission of the research andresults in unrecoverable waste of sampling effort (Ratcliff et al. 2014). Procedures for recording data are driven by the need for correct information and documentation of quality assurance and chain-of-custody information.

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

            "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

            "Water Quality Measurements Using a Conductivity/DO/Temperature Meter",
            "Standardizing sampling effort, techniques, and gear is critical to allow for comparisons of data among field stations. A suite of environmental measurements are recorded at every site immediately before sampling for fishes. Measurements or observations are taken at the anticipated midpoint of a run (electrofishing, trawling) or at the net location for sampling locations with stationary gear (fyke netting, hoop netting).Water temperature is an essential indicator of freshwater fish health and ecosystem health. Water temperature influences fish metabolic rates, gonad development, fry and fish behavior, and fish embryo development time (Alabaster and Lloyd 2013). Unseasonable (high or low) changes in water temperature can greatly disrupt fish life cycles and health and can result in premature mortality (Alabaster and Lloyd). Thus water temperature isan important measurement for determining the health of the sampling site.Oxygen ispotentially as important as organic substrates derived from food in determining the energy budget for fish. Dissolved oxygen (DO) availability likely affects the ecology of fishesthrough the availability of energy for locomotion, growth, and reproduction (Kramer 1987). Diminished DO concentrations, which can occur with increasing temperatures, can cause behavioral changes in fish, habitat selection changes, and mortality (Kramer 1987; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013).Specific conductance is also an important indicator of ecosystem health. Specific conductance can be a useful indicator of macroinvertebratediversity and richness (Walters et al. 2009; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013), and elevated conductivity has beenlinked to increased urbanization and altered macroinvertebrate assemblages (Walters et al. 2009). Because macroinvertebratesare a common food source of many fish species, it is no surprise that macroinvertebrate densities and fish densities are often positively correlated (Walters et al. 2009).Food webs are inherently dependent on the health of the ecosystem. Water quality measurements like temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygenhelp identify ecosystem health and thus provideessential data for long term resource monitoring and specifically fish monitoring."

Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries.

With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

The goal is to characterize in-stream and floodplain geomorphology to support aquatic habitat analyses and numerical models of flow and sediment transport. Tools were created for ArcGIS to conduct several types of analyses associated with DEMs, including geomorphic change detection, uncertainty analyses, user-defined density of cross-sections and longitudinal profiles. These tools can extract hydrologic parameters such as wetted area, bankfull width, water depths, hydraulic radius, gradient, sinuosity (McKean et al. 2009), erosion and depositional patterns and budgets, and uncertainty in the DEM (Wheaton et al. 2010). Using an automated detrending algorithm we are able to remove the overall valley slope. Tools are being created that use the detrended raster to investigate flooding outside a main channel at any prescribed discharge or flow stage. The RBT will also allow users to recreate other survey protocols that use cross-sectional and longitudinal profile approaches.

            "Topographic Point Collection v2.0",
            "To capture X, Y, and Z coordinates as points and lines that collectively represent a topographic surface of the stream channel and floodplain. Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks. Changes made for 2012: - added water surface (ws) code - added mid-channel island (mw) code - added inflow point (in) code - added outflow point (out) code - added discharge (q) code"

            "Standardizing sampling effort, techniques, and gear is critical to allow for comparisons of data among field stations. A suite of environmental measurements are recorded at every site immediately before sampling for fishes. Measurements or observations are taken at the anticipated midpoint of a run (electrofishing, trawling) or at the net location for sampling locations with stationary gear (fyke netting, hoop netting).Water temperature is an essential indicator of freshwater fish health and ecosystem health. Water temperature influences fish metabolic rates, gonad development, fry and fish behavior, and fish embryo development time (Alabaster and Lloyd 2013). Unseasonable (high or low) changes in water temperature can greatly disrupt fish life cycles and health and can result in premature mortality (Alabaster and Lloyd). Thus water temperature isan important measurement for determining the health of the sampling site.Oxygen ispotentially as important as organic substrates derived from food in determining the energy budget for fish. Dissolved oxygen (DO) availability likely affects the ecology of fishesthrough the availability of energy for locomotion, growth, and reproduction (Kramer 1987). Diminished DO concentrations, which can occur with increasing temperatures, can cause behavioral changes in fish, habitat selection changes, and mortality (Kramer 1987; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013).Specific conductance is also an important indicator of ecosystem health. Specific conductance can be a useful indicator of macroinvertebratediversity and richness (Walters et al. 2009; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013), and elevated conductivity has beenlinked to increased urbanization and altered macroinvertebrate assemblages (Walters et al. 2009). Because macroinvertebratesare a common food source of many fish species, it is no surprise that macroinvertebrate densities and fish densities are often positively correlated (Walters et al. 2009).Food webs are inherently dependent on the health of the ecosystem. Water quality measurements like temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygenhelp identify ecosystem health and thus provideessential data for long term resource monitoring and specifically fish monitoring."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

Electrofisher settings will be pulsed direct current (DC) at 60 pulses per second, 40% power, and low voltage range (50-500 V) which are withing the range established by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS 2000) (Table 3). McMichael (2018) conducted electrofishing in the McNary Pool in 2017 and found that the most efficient and fish safe electrofisher power output was between 2-4 amperes. Output will be adjusted to the minimum amperes to achieve fish galvanotaxis (narcosis). Effective sampling depth is about 2 meters and will occur at night."

            "Historical reach or project scale abundance estimates typically required simplifying assumptions about fish density in sampled versus unsampled areas with some rationale, but lack validation using empirical data (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). We propose to take advantage of a new hierarchal Bayesian modeling approach to estimate predator abundance in the Columbia River between Priest Rapids and McNary dams (Korman et al. 2016). Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled). A more detailed description of the field methods, model structure and assumptions is provide below."

Predators are marked with Floy tags (see method ID: 1443) then recaptured at successive intervals throughout the juvenile outmigration season. The mark and recapture information is then used in a computer program to generate estimates of predator abundance. This method applies to smallmouth bass but can be customized for use with any predator."

The diet composition (percent of various prey taxa in the diet) of Caspian terns is investigated during the time that birds reside on breeding colonies, roughly from April through August. In addition to providing data on the types of fish consumed, data collected from fish watch observations can also be used to calculate the total number of fish consumed via bioenergetics modeling (see Method entitled Bioenergetics Modeling to Determine Fish Consumption by Bird Colonies). Presented here are methods used to collect fish watch data at the Caspian tern colony on East Sand Island in the Columbia River estuary."

Photos and ground counts are taken at various periods during the birds nesting season, including the period of peak egg incubation (to quantify the total number of adults) and the period of peak chick rearing (to quantify productivity). Multiple ground counts of sitting/standing or adult/juveniles are taken in concert with aerial surveys to calibrate counts from aerial imagery. Aerial images are georeferenced so the total amount of habitat used by the birds during the nesting season can also be quantified.  Data on the total number of nesting pairs (adults), young (productivity), and habitat use can then be used to evaluate the efficacy of avian management actions aimed at reducing colony size and, ultimately, impacts from the colony on juvenile salmonids."

Adult and juvenile Caspian terns and double-crested cormorants can be captured and banded with field readable leg bands to measure survival, post-breeding dispersal, movements among colonies, age of first breeding, relative dispersal, and the effects of disturbance or dissuasion. Demography and dispersal data is a key component of evaluating the efficacy of management actions to relocate tern and cormorant colonies that pose a risk to the survival of juvenile salmonids and other fish of conservation concern in the Columbia River estuary. Data derived from banding and band resighting is also paramount to our basic understanding of avian biology and ecology. Tern bands resighted by the public or by other, non-project staff at sites throughout North America can be reported via www.mybandedtern.org, a web site dedicated to previously banded Caspian terns.

Avian predation rates can then be calculated based on the percentage of PIT-tagged juvenile salmonids released and/or detected passing hydroelectric dams that are subsequently consumed and deposited by birds on their nesting colonies. Because each PIT tag represents a unique fish, the tag recovery approach allows the testing of hypotheses on the effects of smolt morphology, condition, abundance, and origin on smolt vulnerability to avian predation."

Tools were created for ArcGIS to conduct several types of analyses associated with DEMs, including geomorphic change detection, uncertainty analyses, user-defined density of cross-sections and longitudinal profiles. These tools can extract hydrologic parameters such as wetted area, bankfull width, water depths, hydraulic radius, gradient, sinuosity (McKean et al. 2009), erosion and depositional patterns and budgets, and uncertainty in the DEM (Wheaton et al. 2010). Using an automated detrending algorithm we are able to remove the overall valley slope.

Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks.

The RBT allows users to describe and measure river channels using high resolution digital elevation models (DEM). The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

            "The ability to see and count what is under the surface of the water without disturbing the habitat or the fish is a key advantage of hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can sample the entire water column quickly, and detailed maps of fish densities and mean sizes can be obtained over large bodies of water. As more area is encompassed by a sample, many of the sampling problems created by the spatial patchiness of fish distribution are alleviated. Thus, there tends to be less variation in density estimates across acoustic transects compared to purse-seine hauls or other gear types. Also, the frequency band used in scientific sonars (typically 38 to 200 kHz) is not detectable by most fishes (except see Mann et al. 2001; Gregory and Clabburn 2003). There remain limitations in the type of data that can be collected using hydroacoustics. Currently, single frequency hydroacoustics cannot identify the target species, though broadband and multifrequency sonar systems are showing promise in discerning species in low-diversity systems (Fernandes et al. 2003). Side-looking mobile hydroacoustics cannot discern modes in lengthfrequency distributions unless large differences in length classes exist. When these limitations are recognized, hydroacoustic sampling efforts are cost effective, as estimates from creel surveys are expensive and labor intensive, and the estimates developed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU) measures are not necessarily directly proportional to fish density (Hubert 1996:158159; Yule 2000). When used in concert with purse seining or other active sampling gears, hydroacoustics can provide a comprehensive survey method capable of providing valuable information on target size, population densities, and spatial distribution. Additional aspects of the strengths and limitations of acoustic surveys can be found in MacLennan and Simmonds (1992) and Brandt (1996)."

Observing the relative abundance of hydric, riparian, and upland species with respect to distance from the main channel defines the extent and characterizes the riparian area with respect to local flora communities typical for the area (Crawford 2003). Over time, changes reveal whether floodplains are expanding and becoming further inundated as is shown to occur in the presence of damming high levels of beaver activity (Pollock, et al. 2014). In addition to measuring changes in vegetative composition and abundance at various distances from the main channel, these methods aid in tracking beaver forage radius and woody species recruitment rates at study sites with beaver activity.Transect data measurements are collected within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1), with the first quadrat beginning at the greenline, and 3-5 quadrat measurements within one transect. A transect is laid out starting at the greenline and distance along the transect is measured by walking away from the greenline, perpendicular to stream flow. The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton, T.A., S.J. Smith, and E.R. Cowley. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008)."

            "Floodplain Monitoring Greenline Data Collection v1.0",
            "This procedure is designed to monitor the composition (percent cover), woody species individuals, and greenline-to-greenline width (GGW) along the greenline of a stream. It is designed for arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, dominated by willow and shrub-steppe. This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor the greenline before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation at the greenline.Streamside vegetation and GGW are significant indicators of the levels of incision and riparian health (Burton et al. 2011). Because changes occur most rapidly at the greenline due to high levels of disturbance, greenline vegetation data can be used to make early management decisions (Winward 2000). There are a variety of stream health indicators that can be assessed, using the data metrics collected at the greenline. For example: the presence or absence of deep rooted perennial vegetation can indicate how susceptible the streambank is to erosion; the types of hydrophilic species present can indicate the successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity; the abundance of invasive exotic species found at the greenline (due to high levels of disturbance) can indicate the degree to which the area is susceptible to the establishment of invasive species. Measuring the GGW will provide a more general view into landscape level changes. Over time, changing GGW indicates the degree of sediment aggradation occurring to create a wider stream networks, a key component to improving habitat complexity within and along narrow, incised channels (Pollock et al. 2007) and how quickly this change is occurring.Greenline data measurements are collected in pairs, one on each side of the channel, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1). The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton et al. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008). The measurements taken within the quadrat, in conjunction with information about each quadrats location along the reach, can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization (browse), and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence."

            "Gill Netting",
            "Variable mesh gill nets are appropriate for sampling when fish mortality is not a limiting factor. Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993). Additional insights into use of gill nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

            "Boat Electrofishing",
            "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

Field practitioners must physically walk each reach, using a GPS to geo-reference each habitat type, and afterwards post-process the GPS data to create a map of the reach. See method 6910 Habitat Type for field procedures.Habitat types are recorded in one of two formats, either as a polyline or a polygon and classified into channel pattern and type. The appropriate format is based upon the wetted/bankfull channel size and data collection precision and effort. The format chosen should be whichever of the two options will provide the most accurate representation of the relative habitat abundances for a stream section. In general, a polyline format is used on channels less than 20m bankfull width and a polygon format is used on larger channels. In some instances it may be appropriate to employ both formats during a single survey effort.All months are rated the same for this attribute, although it is recognized that the relative amount of this habitat type can change over a wide range of flow levels. When rating this attribute, a moderate flow level should be assumed. Habitat types are entered as a point estimate of the percentage of the stream reach wetted width for the particular habitat type."

With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat.The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

The direction of a fish movement was classified as top, bottom, left or right, with each consisting of a ninety-degree range centered at the focal point (Figure 1). Movements were classified as either feeding or agonistic depending upon whether the focal fish 1) obtained a food item, or 2) moved aggressively as an instigator or in response to an intruding Chinook.

However, river basins of the Northern Hemisphere host the highest number of non-native fish species and they represent more than a quarter of the total number of species(Leprieuret al. 2008). Non-native species can often become invasive species due to many factors including: the release from enemies (parasites/predators/etc.) or having novel weapons or traits that gives the invasive species an advantage in their introduced system (Torchin et al. 2003, Callaway and Ridenour 2004). Furthermore, invasive species can cost hundreds of billions of dollars annually to mitigate and maintain (Pimentel et al. 2005).Thus, the identificationof the fish to a species level is importantecologically and economically.Correct and complete recording of data is absolutely essential to the success of all long term resource monitoring programefforts (Ratcliff et al. 2014). Conversely, failure to comply with data recording procedures compromises the mission of the research andresults in unrecoverable waste of sampling effort (Ratcliff et al. 2014). Procedures for recording data are driven by the need for correct information and documentation of quality assurance and chain-of-custody information. Allfield staff that collect fish and turtle data are expected to understand and comply with data recording and tracking procedures.Electronic data entry has improved the speed and accuracy of collecting and entering data while decreasing the number of potential errors identified in the raw, unreconciled data by an order of magnitude (Ratcliff et al. 2014)."

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

            "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

            "Water Quality Measurements Using a Conductivity/DO/Temperature Meter",
            "Standardizing sampling effort, techniques, and gear is critical to allow for comparisons of data among field stations. A suite of environmental measurements are recorded at every site immediately before sampling for fishes. Measurements or observations are taken at the anticipated midpoint of a run (electrofishing, trawling) or at the net location for sampling locations with stationary gear (fyke netting, hoop netting).Water temperature is an essential indicator of freshwater fish health and ecosystem health. Water temperature influences fish metabolic rates, gonad development, fry and fish behavior, and fish embryo development time (Alabaster and Lloyd 2013). Unseasonable (high or low) changes in water temperature can greatly disrupt fish life cycles and health and can result in premature mortality (Alabaster and Lloyd). Thus water temperature isan important measurement for determining the health of the sampling site.Oxygen ispotentially as important as organic substrates derived from food in determining the energy budget for fish. Dissolved oxygen (DO) availability likely affects the ecology of fishesthrough the availability of energy for locomotion, growth, and reproduction (Kramer 1987). Diminished DO concentrations, which can occur with increasing temperatures, can cause behavioral changes in fish, habitat selection changes, and mortality (Kramer 1987; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013).Specific conductance is also an important indicator of ecosystem health. Specific conductance can be a useful indicator of macroinvertebratediversity and richness (Walters et al. 2009; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013), and elevated conductivity has beenlinked to increased urbanization and altered macroinvertebrate assemblages (Walters et al. 2009). Because macroinvertebratesare a common food source of many fish species, it is no surprise that macroinvertebrate densities and fish densities are often positively correlated (Walters et al. 2009).Food webs are inherently dependent on the health of the ecosystem. Water quality measurements like temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygenhelp identify ecosystem health and thus provideessential data for long term resource monitoring and specifically fish monitoring."

Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks.

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Progeny from any of these parents (either collected as juveniles or returning adults), if genotyped, could be assigned back to their parents, thus identifying the hatchery they originated from and exact brood year they were produced in (Anderson and Garza 2005; Steele et al 2011). Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number. The step by step instructions below summarize tissue sampling and storage in either coin envelopes (dry method) or in tubes filled with ethanol."

The RBT is being actively developed by ESSA Technologies and is available for free. The goal is to characterize in-stream and floodplain geomorphology to support aquatic habitat analyses and numerical models of flow and sediment transport. Tools were created for ArcGIS to conduct several types of analyses associated with DEMs, including geomorphic change detection, uncertainty analyses, user-defined density of cross-sections and longitudinal profiles. These tools can extract hydrologic parameters such as wetted area, bankfull width, water depths, hydraulic radius, gradient, sinuosity (McKean et al. 2009), erosion and depositional patterns and budgets, and uncertainty in the DEM (Wheaton et al. 2010). Using an automated detrending algorithm we are able to remove the overall valley slope. Tools are being created that use the detrended raster to investigate flooding outside a main channel at any prescribed discharge or flow stage. The RBT will also allow users to recreate other survey protocols that use cross-sectional and longitudinal profile approaches.

            "To capture X, Y, and Z coordinates as points and lines that collectively represent a topographic surface of the stream channel and floodplain. Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks.

            "Standardizing sampling effort, techniques, and gear is critical to allow for comparisons of data among field stations. A suite of environmental measurements are recorded at every site immediately before sampling for fishes. Measurements or observations are taken at the anticipated midpoint of a run (electrofishing, trawling) or at the net location for sampling locations with stationary gear (fyke netting, hoop netting).Water temperature is an essential indicator of freshwater fish health and ecosystem health. Water temperature influences fish metabolic rates, gonad development, fry and fish behavior, and fish embryo development time (Alabaster and Lloyd 2013). Unseasonable (high or low) changes in water temperature can greatly disrupt fish life cycles and health and can result in premature mortality (Alabaster and Lloyd). Thus water temperature isan important measurement for determining the health of the sampling site.Oxygen ispotentially as important as organic substrates derived from food in determining the energy budget for fish. Dissolved oxygen (DO) availability likely affects the ecology of fishesthrough the availability of energy for locomotion, growth, and reproduction (Kramer 1987). Diminished DO concentrations, which can occur with increasing temperatures, can cause behavioral changes in fish, habitat selection changes, and mortality (Kramer 1987; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013).Specific conductance is also an important indicator of ecosystem health. Specific conductance can be a useful indicator of macroinvertebratediversity and richness (Walters et al. 2009; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013), and elevated conductivity has beenlinked to increased urbanization and altered macroinvertebrate assemblages (Walters et al. 2009). Because macroinvertebratesare a common food source of many fish species, it is no surprise that macroinvertebrate densities and fish densities are often positively correlated (Walters et al. 2009).Food webs are inherently dependent on the health of the ecosystem. Water quality measurements like temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygenhelp identify ecosystem health and thus provideessential data for long term resource monitoring and specifically fish monitoring."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

Large floods can form bars that extend above bankfull whereas several years of low flows can result in bars forming below bankfull elevation.iii.

With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks.

Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4.

            "The ability to see and count what is under the surface of the water without disturbing the habitat or the fish is a key advantage of hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can sample the entire water column quickly, and detailed maps of fish densities and mean sizes can be obtained over large bodies of water. As more area is encompassed by a sample, many of the sampling problems created by the spatial patchiness of fish distribution are alleviated. Thus, there tends to be less variation in density estimates across acoustic transects compared to purse-seine hauls or other gear types. Also, the frequency band used in scientific sonars (typically 38 to 200 kHz) is not detectable by most fishes (except see Mann et al. 2001; Gregory and Clabburn 2003). There remain limitations in the type of data that can be collected using hydroacoustics. Currently, single frequency hydroacoustics cannot identify the target species, though broadband and multifrequency sonar systems are showing promise in discerning species in low-diversity systems (Fernandes et al. 2003). Side-looking mobile hydroacoustics cannot discern modes in lengthfrequency distributions unless large differences in length classes exist. When these limitations are recognized, hydroacoustic sampling efforts are cost effective, as estimates from creel surveys are expensive and labor intensive, and the estimates developed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU) measures are not necessarily directly proportional to fish density (Hubert 1996:158159; Yule 2000). When used in concert with purse seining or other active sampling gears, hydroacoustics can provide a comprehensive survey method capable of providing valuable information on target size, population densities, and spatial distribution. Additional aspects of the strengths and limitations of acoustic surveys can be found in MacLennan and Simmonds (1992) and Brandt (1996)."

It is designed for arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, dominated by willow and shrub-steppe. This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor floodplain vegetation response before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation with increasing distance from the main channel. These methods can be completed in conjunction with the Floodplain Vegetation Monitoring Greenline Data Collection methods.In riparian areas, change is continuous due to flux in stream flow and sediment aggregation, resulting in pronounced changes in successional vegetation (Windward 2000). Monitoring the change in vegetation communities and at what distance these changes are occurring with respect to the main channel create a cross-section portrait of the riparian zone over time. Observing the relative abundance of hydric, riparian, and upland species with respect to distance from the main channel defines the extent and characterizes the riparian area with respect to local flora communities typical for the area (Crawford 2003). Over time, changes reveal whether floodplains are expanding and becoming further inundated as is shown to occur in the presence of damming high levels of beaver activity (Pollock, et al. 2014). In addition to measuring changes in vegetative composition and abundance at various distances from the main channel, these methods aid in tracking beaver forage radius and woody species recruitment rates at study sites with beaver activity.Transect data measurements are collected within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1), with the first quadrat beginning at the greenline, and 3-5 quadrat measurements within one transect. A transect is laid out starting at the greenline and distance along the transect is measured by walking away from the greenline, perpendicular to stream flow. The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton, T.A., S.J. Smith, and E.R. Cowley. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008)."

However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation at the greenline.Streamside vegetation and GGW are significant indicators of the levels of incision and riparian health (Burton et al. 2011). Because changes occur most rapidly at the greenline due to high levels of disturbance, greenline vegetation data can be used to make early management decisions (Winward 2000). There are a variety of stream health indicators that can be assessed, using the data metrics collected at the greenline. For example: the presence or absence of deep rooted perennial vegetation can indicate how susceptible the streambank is to erosion; the types of hydrophilic species present can indicate the successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity; the abundance of invasive exotic species found at the greenline (due to high levels of disturbance) can indicate the degree to which the area is susceptible to the establishment of invasive species. Measuring the GGW will provide a more general view into landscape level changes. Over time, changing GGW indicates the degree of sediment aggradation occurring to create a wider stream networks, a key component to improving habitat complexity within and along narrow, incised channels (Pollock et al. 2007) and how quickly this change is occurring.Greenline data measurements are collected in pairs, one on each side of the channel, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1). The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton et al. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008). The measurements taken within the quadrat, in conjunction with information about each quadrats location along the reach, can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization (browse), and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence."

The sampling method (ID 244) and analysis method (ID 164) described in this document were designed to generate data sufficient to characterize the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage and evaluate impacts from human caused disturbances. The purpose of this protocol is to characterize the macroinvertebrate assemblage for a stream reach as an indicator of biological integrity and stream health. It is not intended to characterize the condition of individual stream habitats or to provide data to analyze the macroinvertebrates as a food source for fish.These collection procedures, along with other environmental data, will allow analysis of biotic data with either multi-metric [e.g., an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI)] or predictive models [e.g., River InVertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS)] methods. Use of these procedures will allow users to share data, express their data in terms of standardized bioassessment measures, and thus directly compare their results with all other parties using these methods. Their general use does not preclude use of other sampling procedures that may be needed to address the specific objectives of individual projects.Macroinvertebrates are good indicators of watershed health because they live in the water for all or most of their life, are easy to collect, differ in their tolerance to amount and types of pollution/habitat alteration, can be identified in a laboratory, often live for more than one year; have limited mobility, and are integrators of environmental condition.Analysis PrepMany different approaches have been used to prepare and analyze macroinvertebrate assemblage data. But they all start out with a list of macroinvertebrates that were collected, identified, and counted. The data analysis tools presented in Monitoring Resources (method 4084) published under the Northwest Biological Assessment Workgroup are the methods commonly used by State and Federal agencies to analyze and interpret macroinvertebrate data.All of the data analysis procedures described in Monitoring Resources published under the Northwest Biological Assessment Workgroup (method 4084) concept of using a reference condition in order to determine divergence from expected conditions. Whether you develop this information yourself, or rely on what others have developed, reference conditions are described in method ID 4082.Data AnalysisThere are three major categories of data analyses that can be conducted with your macroinvertebrate data they are individual metrics, a biological index (often called an IBI, or Index of Biological Integrity) and predictive models (i.e. RIVPACs). The type of analysis you do will depend upon your capabilities, the type of questions that you are trying to answer (your monitoring objectives), the amount of data that you have and, if you are using existing reference condition, then type of tool that was used to develop this reference condition.Multimetric indexAmultimetricindex combines indicators, or metrics, into a single index value, often called an Index of Biological Integrity orIBI. The individual metrics that provide information on diverse biological attributes are integrated into an index to provide an overall indication of biological condition. This document will not cover how to develop anIBI, however, detailed methods for the multi-metricIBIdevelopment are outlined inKeransandKarr(1994) and Barbour et al. (1999). Multi-metric Indexes (IBIs) that have been developed in the northwest and their applicability to data collected using the field protocol are cited in this document.Use of a multi-metric index requires use of comparable field protocols and taxonomic laboratory protocols for generating biological data. Multi-metric indexes are developed for specific regions on the landscape and use of the analytical tool is restricted to streams within this region (i.e. small streams in the Puget Lowlandecoregion)."

            "After completing a trawling event, the data must be analyzed in order to calculate density estimates. These estimates must be completed even when the final population estimate is completed using hydroacoustics because the age-specific proportions needed for the final estimate come from trawling. Because the minimum and maximum depths of the kokanee layer are not identical throughout the lake, the volume of water sampled varies by transect, and thus, the proportion of each age class is not a simple percent of fish collected. Herein we describe how we estimate fish density from the trawling data."

            "Variable mesh gill nets are appropriate for sampling when fish mortality is not a limiting factor. Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993). Additional insights into use of gill nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

The RBT allows users to describe and measure river channels using high resolution digital elevation models (DEM). The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat.The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

However, river basins of the Northern Hemisphere host the highest number of non-native fish species and they represent more than a quarter of the total number of species(Leprieuret al. 2008). Non-native species can often become invasive species due to many factors including: the release from enemies (parasites/predators/etc.) or having novel weapons or traits that gives the invasive species an advantage in their introduced system (Torchin et al. 2003, Callaway and Ridenour 2004). Furthermore, invasive species can cost hundreds of billions of dollars annually to mitigate and maintain (Pimentel et al. 2005).Thus, the identificationof the fish to a species level is importantecologically and economically.Correct and complete recording of data is absolutely essential to the success of all long term resource monitoring programefforts (Ratcliff et al. 2014). Conversely, failure to comply with data recording procedures compromises the mission of the research andresults in unrecoverable waste of sampling effort (Ratcliff et al. 2014). Procedures for recording data are driven by the need for correct information and documentation of quality assurance and chain-of-custody information. Allfield staff that collect fish and turtle data are expected to understand and comply with data recording and tracking procedures.Electronic data entry has improved the speed and accuracy of collecting and entering data while decreasing the number of potential errors identified in the raw, unreconciled data by an order of magnitude (Ratcliff et al. 2014)."

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Progeny from any of these parents (either collected as juveniles or returning adults), if genotyped, could be assigned back to their parents, thus identifying the hatchery they originated from and exact brood year they were produced in (Anderson and Garza 2005; Steele et al 2011). Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

A suite of environmental measurements are recorded at every site immediately before sampling for fishes. Measurements or observations are taken at the anticipated midpoint of a run (electrofishing, trawling) or at the net location for sampling locations with stationary gear (fyke netting, hoop netting).Water temperature is an essential indicator of freshwater fish health and ecosystem health. Water temperature influences fish metabolic rates, gonad development, fry and fish behavior, and fish embryo development time (Alabaster and Lloyd 2013). Unseasonable (high or low) changes in water temperature can greatly disrupt fish life cycles and health and can result in premature mortality (Alabaster and Lloyd). Thus water temperature isan important measurement for determining the health of the sampling site.Oxygen ispotentially as important as organic substrates derived from food in determining the energy budget for fish. Dissolved oxygen (DO) availability likely affects the ecology of fishesthrough the availability of energy for locomotion, growth, and reproduction (Kramer 1987). Diminished DO concentrations, which can occur with increasing temperatures, can cause behavioral changes in fish, habitat selection changes, and mortality (Kramer 1987; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013).Specific conductance is also an important indicator of ecosystem health. Specific conductance can be a useful indicator of macroinvertebratediversity and richness (Walters et al. 2009; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013), and elevated conductivity has beenlinked to increased urbanization and altered macroinvertebrate assemblages (Walters et al. 2009). Because macroinvertebratesare a common food source of many fish species, it is no surprise that macroinvertebrate densities and fish densities are often positively correlated (Walters et al. 2009).Food webs are inherently dependent on the health of the ecosystem. Water quality measurements like temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygenhelp identify ecosystem health and thus provideessential data for long term resource monitoring and specifically fish monitoring."

The RBT allows users to describe and measure river channels using high resolution digital elevation models (DEM). The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

Currently, the proportions of hatchery and natural-origin fish that spawn in this reach is unknown but the target is>85% natural fish. One approach to determining these proportions is to collect fall Chinook spawner carcasses conduct genetic analyses of their tissue. Since 2015, all hatchery fall Chinook salmon in the Snake River basin are analyzed for PBT (parentage based tagging). The results of tissue analysis can be compared to the database of hatchery fish to determine which fish are hatchery and natural."

We propose to take advantage of a new hierarchal Bayesian modeling approach to estimate predator abundance in the Columbia River between Priest Rapids and McNary dams (Korman et al. 2016). Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled). A more detailed description of the field methods, model structure and assumptions is provide below."

These materials influence channel stability and resistance to scour during high flow events. The frequency of bed load transport can be critically important to fish spawning and other aquatic organisms that use the substrate for cover. The pebble count procedure was originally designed to quantify streambed substrate without having to collect substrate samples and take them back to the lab for sieve analysis. The procedure requires taking measurements of substrate at increments along main channel and side channels transects within bankfull constraints."

An active channel will have some combination of the following bankfull indicators:i. Examine stream banks for an active floodplain. This is a relatively flat, depositional area that is commonly vegetated and above the bankfull elevation.ii. Examine depositional features such as point bars. The highest elevation of a point bar usually indicates the lowest possible elevation for bankfull stage. However, depositional features can form both above and below the bankfull elevation when unusual flows occur during years preceding the survey. Large floods can form bars that extend above bankfull whereas several years of low flows can result in bars forming below bankfull elevation.iii. A break in slope of the banks and/or change in the particle size distribution from coarser bed load particles to finer particles deposited during bank overflow conditions.iv. Locate the elevation where mature key riparian woody vegetation exists. The lowest elevation of birch, alder, and dogwood can be useful, whereas willows are often found below the bankfull elevation.v. Examine the ceiling of undercut banks. This elevation is usually slightly below the bankfull elevation.vi. Stream channels actively reform bankfull features such as floodplains after shifts or down cutting in the channel.
