2. Abstract: The Department of Water Resources is responsible for monitoring water quality in the San Francisco Bay Delta through the collection of discrete data using advanced technology called water quality sondes. This method ensures compliance with regulations such as Water Resources Decision D-1641 and provides essential information to manage and protect this valuable resource.
3. Description: The Department of Water Resources utilizes water quality sondes, specialized instruments that measure various parameters of water quality, at key sites in the San Francisco Bay Delta. This method is mandated by regulations such as Water Resources Decision D-1641 to ensure thorough and accurate data collection. Water quality sondes provide discrete measurements, meaning they take readings at specific points in time, as opposed to continuous monitoring. The use of these devices enables the Department to collect essential data on the water quality of this important water body, helping them make informed decisions for its management and protection.
4. Target: The primary focus is to collect discrete water quality data in compliance with regulations and protect the San Francisco Bay Delta's water quality.
5. Constraints: The constraints include the need for regular calibration and maintenance of the water quality sondes, as well as ensuring their proper placement and operation at designated key sites. Additionally, complying with Water Resources Decision D-1641 and other regulations may require reporting and documentation that can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
