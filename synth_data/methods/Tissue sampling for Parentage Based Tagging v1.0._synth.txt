2. Abstract: Parentage-based tagging (PBT) is a method used in hatcheries to identify the origin of fish progeny by genotyping all broodstock and their offspring. This technique provides a significant advantage over mechanical tagging methods as it allows for increased sample size and accuracy in tracking the source of each juvenile. The key to successfully implementing PBT is to obtain tissue samples from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning, ensuring proper labeling, preservation, and recording of relevant data.
3. Description: Parentage-based tagging (PBT) is a method used in hatcheries to identify the origin of fish progeny by genotyping all broodstock and their offspring. This process involves collecting tissue samples from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning, preserving them properly in coin envelopes or tubes filled with ethanol, and recording essential data such as sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, and cross information. The primary objective of PBT is to create a parental genotype database that allows for the identification of progeny origin, including the hatchery they originate from and the exact brood year they were produced in. This technology resembles human parentage analyses, focusing on determining paternity or maternity.
4. Target: The primary focus of PBT is to enable accurate identification of the source of each juvenile fish by genotyping all broodstock and their offspring.
5. Constraints: The successful implementation of PBT relies heavily on the ability to sample 100% of hatchery broodstock, ensuring proper tissue sampling, preservation, labeling, and recording of relevant data. Failure to meet these constraints may lead to reduced accuracy in tracking progeny origin and hatchery management.
