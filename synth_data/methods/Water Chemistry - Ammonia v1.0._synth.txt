2. Abstract: The Columbia River Basin has seen a significant decline in anadromous salmonid populations over the past 30 years, with several now protected under the ESA. To address this issue, a comprehensive monitoring strategy is necessary to reduce uncertainties surrounding the declines and develop effective recovery plans. This method proposes continuous monitoring of seven key water quality attributes at specific integrator sites, located downstream of each population or subpopulation. By adhering to manufacturers' guidelines for deployment and calibration, and coupling monitoring stations with associated flow gauges, this strategy enables investigators to assess the impact of stream flow on water quality attributes and ensure data accuracy as per the Oregon Watershed Plan Water Quality Monitoring Technical Guidebook (2001).
3. Description: The Columbia River Basin is home to anadromous salmonid populations that have experienced significant declines over the past 30 years, with several now protected under the ESA. In response to this issue, a comprehensive monitoring strategy must be implemented to address the uncertainties surrounding these declines and develop effective recovery plans. The proposed method involves continuous monitoring of seven water quality attributes identified by the UCMS (Hillman 2006), including temperature (weekly and daily maximums), turbidity, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrogen, and phosphorous. Monitoring sites are located at the downstream end of each population or subpopulation distribution, also known as integrator sites (Jordan 2003). To ensure data accuracy, monitoring programs must adhere to manufacturers' guidelines for deployment and calibration and be co-located with flow gauges operated by the USGS or WDOE. By coupling water quality monitoring stations with associated flow gauges, investigators can assess the effect of stream flow upon the water quality attributes. The accuracies of the water quality instruments must meet the Data Quality Level A as defined by the Oregon Watershed Plan Water Quality Monitoring Technical Guidebook (2001).
4. Target: Develop a comprehensive monitoring strategy for anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin, focusing on continuous monitoring of key water quality attributes at specific integrator sites.
5. Constraints: The success of this method relies on accurate and reliable data collection from current and historical monitoring programs. Additionally, adequate funding is necessary to ensure ongoing monitoring efforts and adherence to manufacturers' guidelines for deployment and calibration. Monitoring programs must also be initiated at the appropriate scale (specific reaches, subpopulations, populations, and ESU) to meet ESA requirements. Finally, water quality instruments must meet Data Quality Level A as defined by the Oregon Watershed Plan Water Quality Monitoring Technical Guidebook (2001).
