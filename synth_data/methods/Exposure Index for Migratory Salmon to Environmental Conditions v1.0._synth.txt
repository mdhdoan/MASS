1. Abstract:
The Exposure Index is a method for quantifying the exposure of a population of animals to an environmental variable at a specific site. This index helps assess the relative exposure of salmon populations to various conditions that may impact their survival, travel time, or fitness during migration. By computing a weighted average of daily environmental variables, this method takes into account the varying exposure levels experienced by fish on different days. The Exposure Index can be applied to any population of animals that can be enumerated at the site where the environmental variable is being monitored.
2. Description:
The Exposure Index is a method designed to calculate the relative exposure of a population of animals to an environmental variable at a specific site. This index considers river conditions during salmon migration, which can vary significantly, and aims to assess the impact of these variations on fish populations. The Exposure Index is calculated as a weighted average of daily environmental variables, where the weights correspond to the number of animals present on each day. The method does not impose any constraints on the type of metrics used for the environmental variable or the population of animals. However, time series data is required to calculate the index.
3. Target:
The primary goal of the Exposure Index is to assess and quantify the relative exposure of a population of animals to an environmental variable at a specific site.
4. Constraints:
There are no explicit constraints mentioned in the text for the current method. However, it requires time series data on both the population of animals and the environmental variable being monitored. Additionally, the method assumes that there is a way to enumerate the population of animals at the site where the environmental variable is being measured.
