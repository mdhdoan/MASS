2. Abstract: This study focuses on the impact of oceanic avian predation on the early marine survival of juvenile salmon in the Pacific Northwest waters, particularly in the Columbia River Plume. By quantifying the distribution and abundance of marine birds and their overlap with juvenile salmon distributions, this research aims to understand how biotic and abiotic environmental conditions influence the early marine life history of coho and Chinook salmon, contributing to a long-term effort by academic and federal scientists to study coastal ecosystems.
2. Description: This research is part of an interdisciplinary, long-term effort to understand coastal ecosystems and biological and physical processes that may influence recruitment variability of salmon in the Pacific Northwest waters. The primary focus is on examining the effects of biotic and abiotic environmental conditions on the early marine life history of coho and Chinook salmon, with a specific interest in the Columbia River Plume due to its importance as an area of high salmonid abundance influenced by anthropogenic factors. The study investigates marine birds as abundant, highly mobile predators that consume fish and zooplankton found in the Columbia River Plume and adjacent coastal waters of the California Current. By quantifying the distribution and abundance of marine birds at sea and their overlap with juvenile salmon distributions, this research aims to determine if oceanic avian predation affects early marine survival of juvenile salmon.
3. Target: The primary focus of this method is understanding the impact of marine bird predation on the early marine survival of juvenile salmon in the Pacific Northwest waters, specifically within the Columbia River Plume.
4. Constraints: The constraints for this current method include potential limitations in data collection related to tracking and observing both marine birds and juvenile salmon distributions simultaneously, as well as accounting for various environmental factors that may influence their interactions. Additionally, further analysis and modeling might be required to establish a causal relationship between oceanic avian predation and early marine survival of juvenile salmon.
