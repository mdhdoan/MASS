2. Abstract:
The Bonneville Power Administration funds a long-term effort by academic and federal scientists to investigate the impact of various environmental factors on Pacific Northwest waters' coastal ecosystems, particularly focusing on the Columbia River Plume. This study addresses the need for understanding how biotic and abiotic conditions affect early marine life history stages of coho and Chinook salmon, which is crucial given their importance in the region and the influence of anthropogenic factors.

3. Description:
This research focuses on a Bonneville Power Administration-funded long-term effort by academic and federal scientists to understand coastal ecosystems and biological and physical processes that affect the variability in salmon recruitment in Pacific Northwest waters, specifically examining coho and Chinook salmon species. The study targets the Columbia River Plume as a critical area of interest due to its significance as an area with high salmonid abundance influenced by human-induced factors. Research is currently focused on the effects of environmental conditions, both biotic and abiotic, on the early marine life history stages of coho and Chinook salmon.

4. Target:
The primary goal of this method is to understand coastal ecosystems and biological and physical processes that may influence recruitment variability of salmon in Pacific Northwest waters, with a specific focus on the Columbia River Plume's effects on juvenile salmon and higher trophic level predators.

5. Constraints:
The main constraints for this method include potential limitations in data collection, limited understanding of certain environmental factors affecting salmon recruitment, and the challenge of accounting for various anthropogenic influences impacting the Columbia River Plume.
