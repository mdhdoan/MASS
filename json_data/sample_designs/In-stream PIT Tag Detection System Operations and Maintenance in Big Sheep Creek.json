  "description": "<p>The detection system consists of 2 antennas, installed in a pass-over loop configuration approximately 170 feet apart. Each half duplex antenna spans the width of the channel which is approximately 80 feet and is operated by a Single-Antenna HDX Reader (Oregon RFID). This site is configured to detect half-duplex tags only. Data from the antennas is stored in the internal memory and is uploaded to PTAGIS on a monthly basis. A 24V DC battery bank connected to solar panel powers the detection system. The antennas were built and installed by WDFW staff. The site is operated year round.</p>\r\n",
