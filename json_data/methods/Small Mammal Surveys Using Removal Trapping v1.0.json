  "abstractText": "The small mammal community is an important component of biological diversity in most ecosystems. Small mammals act as seed dispersal agents, their burrowing disturbs soil and creates microsites for seedling development, and they provide a prey base for higher trophic level consumers (Hallett et al. 2003, Martin 2003). Small mammals can be useful indicators of environmental change for several reasons. They respond rather quickly to disturbances in habitat structure or plant composition, are sufficiently mobile to leave unsuitable sites and relocate to suitable ones but at the same time are dependent upon a localized area for survival, and are ubiquitous and suitably fecund (Leis et al. 2008). Monitoring small mammal species abundance, community diversity, and trends provides information that can be used to determine the effectiveness of management actions in moving towards conservation or restoration goals. Removal trapping is used rather than live-trapping because (1) it allows for positive species identification using skull and teeth morphology, (2) reproductive condition can be determined, and (3) it is more efficient at small-mammal capture (Eulinger and Burt 2011).",
