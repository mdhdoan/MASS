  "abstractText": "Quantitative PCR is used to test an environmental sample for the presence of a species DNA through the use of a species specific primer probe set targeting a small fragment of DNA. Goldberg et al. (2016) and MacDonald and Sarre(2017) identified critical considerations for the development and validation of quantitative PCR assays for environmental DNA (eDNA) analyses. We expand upon these critical considerations in the following step by step instructions.",
