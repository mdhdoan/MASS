  "background": "This protocol describes how data will be collected, managed, analyzed, and reported through 2016 to evaluate a new genetic technology, called Parentage Based Tagging (PBT), that should provide a better tool to meet Fish & Wildlife Program objectives associated with marking hatchery stocks, conducting hatchery evaluations and reform, and enforcing salmonid fishery management measures.  A large-scale evaluation of this technology was recommended by several committees and science review groups (PFMC 2008; PSC 2005; ISRP/ISAB 2009).  State, tribal and federal agencies in the Snake River basin are uniquely positioned to perform large-scale proof-of-concept PBT studies for both steelhead and Chinook because most hatchery steelhead and Chinook broodstock spawned in the Snake River basin (WA, OR, and ID) have been genetically sampled since spawn year 2008; significant resources have been dedicated to the development of powerful and cost-efficient genetic markers for both species (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms-SNPs); and there are sampling programs in place at Bonneville Dam, at Lower Granite Dam, and in tribal and non-tribal fisheries in the mainstem Columbia River and in the Salmon and Clearwater rivers, to sample returning hatchery adults and verify the accuracy and utility of PBT technology. This project is currently creating the first generation of PBT parental genetic baselines for hatchery steelhead and Chinook in the Snake basin (Steele et al 2011). In doing so, it will effectively, permanently genetically mark ~12 million smolts, per species, per year.  This project will work closely with an existing BPA funded project (2008-907-00) to ensure that future genetic marker sets used in the Columbia River basin are standardized, providing unprecedented genetic tools for managing wild and hatchery stocks in the basin with GSI techniques segregating adult wild runs by stock of origin, and PBT technologies identifying the stock and age of sampled hatchery fish.",

  "id": 281,
  "assumptions": "Genetic samples can be collected and properly preserved from every steelhead and Chinook salmon hatchery broodstock spawned in the Snake River basin.  In addition, accurate biological information (stock, spawn date, sex, cross information) can be recorded for every adult sampled.\r\n\r\nA set of SNP markers can be developed/identified that can achieve high parental assignment accuracy even when tens of thousands of potential parents are involved and when parentage involves hatchery populations that are very similar genetically due to shared ancestry or in situations where the broodstock contains closely related individuals (ISRP/ISAB 2009).",
