  "abstractText": "Growth of juvenile salmonids in length and weight are important phenotypic traits that vary widely among native salmonids across watersheds of northern latitudes. A steady increase in population size over time is one factor that can affect long-term changes in those two traits. Growth in length of natural Snake River fall Chinook salmonOncorhynchus tshawytschajuveniles was first described by Connor and Burge (2003). It was concluded that high rates of growth were necessary for maintaining an ocean-type life history. Parr growth prior to reservoir entry provided the most information on variability in parr-to-smolt survival (Connor and Tiffan 2012; inset Figure 4). Connor et al. (2013) were the first to calculate growth in weight of natural Snake River fall Chinook salmon juveniles. That baseline information will be important to consider when assessing the status of the population when future levels of abundance are higher than presently observed and a decision is made about removing Snake River basin fall Chinook salmon from the federal list of threatened species. Methods for calculating the growth in length and weight are described here.",
