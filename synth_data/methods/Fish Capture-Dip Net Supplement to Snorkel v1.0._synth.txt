2. Abstract: This method describes the use of a dipping net as a supplement to night snorkeling for observing and catching fish during fall and winter after civil twilight. The cold temperature causes fish to become less active, making it easier to spot and catch them using a dipping net. This method provides a valuable tool for researchers studying fish behavior in colder months.

3. Description: The text describes a sampling method that utilizes the reduced mobility of fish during cold winter temperatures as an opportunity for observation and collection. By engaging in night snorkeling, researchers can take advantage of this phenomenon to more easily spot and catch fish using a dipping net. This method is particularly useful during fall and winter months, after the end of civil twilight, when other sampling methods may be less effective due to reduced visibility and fish activity. The use of this supplementary sampling method can provide valuable data on fish behavior and population dynamics in colder months.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to serve as a supplementary tool for night snorkeling, enabling researchers to more easily observe and collect fish during the cold winter months.

5. Constraints: This sampling method requires that the water temperature be cold enough to reduce fish mobility, limiting its use to certain times of year and geographic locations. It also relies on the availability of night snorkeling as a primary sampling method, and therefore may not be suitable for all research projects or study sites. Additionally, this method requires specialized equipment (a dipping net) and training in its use, which may limit its accessibility for some researchers.
