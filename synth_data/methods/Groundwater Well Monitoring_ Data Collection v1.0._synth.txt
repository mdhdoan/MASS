2. Abstract: This method details the process of collecting and uploading data from Onset HOBO U20 Water Level Loggers, which are used to monitor changes in water table elevation and temperature as part of a restoration project. By comparing pre-restoration and post-restoration data, project managers can determine if their efforts are meeting intended goals.
3. Description: The method assumes that groundwater wells have been installed and monitoring is being conducted using U20 probes suspended within each well casing. Data collected by the probes are uploaded to a computer using Onset's HOBOware software, following these steps: (1) connect the device to the computer via USB; (2) launch HOBOware; (3) select 'Device' then 'Upload'; and (4) follow prompts to complete the upload process. Once data are uploaded, they can be analyzed to detect changes in water table elevation and temperature patterns, helping ensure that restoration work is achieving project goals.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to provide clear instructions on how to effectively collect and analyze groundwater monitoring data using Onset HOBO U20 Water Level Loggers.
5. Constraints: This method requires access to a computer with HOBOware software installed, as well as a USB connection to the U20 probes. It also assumes that groundwater wells have already been installed and are currently being used for monitoring purposes. Additionally, users must follow all safety guidelines when handling and installing the U20 probes to prevent damage or injury.
