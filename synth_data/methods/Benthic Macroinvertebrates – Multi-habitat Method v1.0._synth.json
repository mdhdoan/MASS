  "abstract": " The multi-habitat method is used to assess benthic communities in slow water habitats that have been restored. This method is necessary when the habitat does not have enough riffles for targeted riffle sampling or when flow is extremely low. The goal is to measure food availability for salmonids using a D-frame kick net, taking samples proportional to the different major habitat types present: hard-bottomed (kick samples) or soft-bottomed (jab/sweep samples). For kick samples, the area in front of the net is disturbed for 30 seconds and the net is swept through the disturbed particles. For jab/sweep samples, a single thrust and sweep is used to collect material from vegetated areas or very calm areas with little flow. This method allows for sampling in various habitat conditions that cannot be assessed using targeted riffle samples. (Code generation not applicable)"

  "description": " In this text, the multi-habitat method is described as a sampling technique used for assessing food type availability in restored slow water habitats for salmonids. This method is particularly relevant after restoration projects have been implemented (post-project years). The goal is to measure benthic community composition in habitats that lack sufficient riffle habitat for targeted riffle sample collections.\n\nThe multi-habitat method employs the D-frame kick-net, similar to the one used for targeted riffle samples. However, due to distinct habitat conditions, sampling procedures differ:\n\n1. Kick Samples: This method is utilized for hard-bottomed habitats like cobble and gravel. It involves placing the dip net on the stream bed and disturbing a 1 ft² (0.09 m²) area in front of the sampler for 30 seconds. This technique may also be used for soft-bottomed habitats with sufficient flow, enabling disturbed particles to flow into the net.\n\n2. Jab/Sweep Samples: In bank, woody debris, vegetated habitats, or very calm areas with little to no flow, jab samples are collected. A single thrust of the net is used to penetrate a 1 ft² (0.09 m²) area of substrate, followed by 2-3 sweeps of the net through the disturbed drift. For vegetated areas, sweeps are conducted directly downstream of the vegetation. In cases with very little flow requiring bottom sediment samples, the net is swept back and forth within the disturbed water column to capture debris while maintaining flow through the net.\n\nThe decision trees in Figures 32 and 33 provide guidelines for selecting the appropriate sampling method based on habitat conditions. Habitats with extremely low gradients or those occurring in oxbows, side-channels, or off-channel habitats may not have enough riffle habitat to collect targeted riffle samples. In such cases, the multi-habitat method is a viable alternative to assess benthic communities."

  "constraints": " The text provides constraints for using the multi-habitat method for benthic sampling based on the following criteria:\n\n1. Restoration projects: Multi-habitat samples are only collected after a restoration project has been implemented (lines 2-4).\n2. Slow water habitats: Multi-habitat samples are used to assess food type availability in slow water habitats created or connected by restoration actions (line 5).\n3. Lack of riffle habitat: If the total available area of riffle habitat is less than 8 ft² (2.4 m²), other methods, such as multi-habitat sampling, are necessary to assess benthic communities in these habitats (lines 19-22).\n4. Habitat types: Sampling is performed according to major habitat types, using either kick samples or jab/sweep samples depending on the habitat conditions (lines 25-30).\n5. Low flow areas: For areas with very little flow requiring a bottom sediment sample, the area in front of the net is disturbed and the net is swept back and forth within the disturbed water column to capture debris and maintain flow through the net (lines 31-34).\n\nTherefore, the constraints applicable to the multi-habitat method are:\n\n1. Sampling after restoration projects have been implemented.\n2. Assessing food type availability in slow water habitats created or connected by restoration actions.\n3. Utilizing other methods for assessing benthic communities when riffle habitat is not available or has less than 8 ft² (2.4 m²) of total area.\n4. Sampling according to major habitat types using appropriate sampling techniques: kick samples or jab/sweep samples.\n5. For low flow areas, disturbing the area in front of the net and sweeping back and forth within the disturbed water column to capture debris and maintain flow through the net."
