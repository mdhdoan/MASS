  "abstractText": "To measure water depth along the thalweg for the entire sample reach. The spacing between thalweg depth measurements is determined as a function of stream width.Note: thalweg measurements should not be taken on side channels or in pools on the side of the main channel that the thalweg does not flow through.See Appendix C of the cited protocol for guidance on how to take thalweg measurements in reaches with interrupted flow or in braided systems. If continuous thalweg depth measurements are not taken along the entire reach, a thalweg depth measurement still needs to be taken at each transect in order to compute floodplain connectivity.The location of the thalweg is identified using the following criteria:The thalweg is the longitudinal path of a stream connecting the deepest part of the channel and usually containing the most flow. The thalweg is used to quantify the longitudinal profile of a reach and thus the heterogeneity of the streambed morphology and associated channel units.The thalweg can be identified by finding the location laterally across a stream that has the deepest water and usually the most flow. One should be able to walk up- or downstream and consistently follow the thalweg. In low gradient, sinuous systems, the thalweg will alternate between left and right bank. The thalweg usually crosses from one side of the river to the other in riffles,making the location of the thalweg in some riffles hard to identify. In such instances, the thalweg generally corresponds to the center of the riffle.Once the thalweg is identified, depth measurements are taken at one-sixteenth of transect spacing. For example, a reach of 150 m has transects every 15 m, and the thalweg will be measured every 94 cm.",
