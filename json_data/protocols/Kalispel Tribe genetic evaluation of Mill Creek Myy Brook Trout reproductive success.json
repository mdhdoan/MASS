  "background": "To address impacts to native Westslope Cutthroat Trout (cutthroat) populations by non-nativeBrook Trout,actions have been implemented to reduce theirabundance in select streams. Mechanical, chemical or alternative removal methods have been applied, that reduce Brook trout abundance and allownatural or assisted re-occupancy of vacated habitat.In Mill Creek, multiple-pass backpack electrofishing has beenemployed as the primary method to reduce Brook Trout, yet established populationscan be difficult to control or eradicate with traditionaltechniques (Britton et al. 2010). To augment this method, we are attempting to shiftthe sex ratio of the Brook Troutpopulation through use of the Trojan Y Chromosome method, consistingof production and stocking of male fish that are genetically YY (MYY), instead of XY, into areas inhabited by the non-native species targeted for removal (Gutierrez and Teem 2006; Teem and Gutierrez 2010; Schill et al. 2016, 2017). All offspring produced by MYYmales are male. In theory, if stocked MYYmales successfully spawnwith female Brook Troutfrom the target population and contributesufficient numbers of offspring, the sex ratio of the target population should shift toward male fish. Over time, given continued stocking, the target population should eventually become 100% male, resulting ultimately in extirpation.IDFG developed MYYBrook Trout stocks (Schill et al. 2016) and modelled the success of coupling various MYYBrook Troutstocking strategiesand levels of active suppression of the extant population (Schill et al. 2017). The Western Associationof Fish and Wildlife Agencies subsequently initiatedtrials of stocked MYYBrook Trout in several western states. Mill Creek was selected as a a pilot project due to active Brook Trout suppression that has taken place by the Kalispel Tribe since 2018. Approximately 3,000-4,000 MYYBrook Trout have been stocked in Mill Creek annually since 2018. The the intent of this project is to evaluate MYYcontribution toward shifting the population to predominantly males, thus expediting the extirpation of Brook Trout from Mill Creek and allowing cutthroat to eventually reoccupy>30 km of vacated habitat.Using annual genetic tissue sampling of juveniles, parentage information collected will inform the spawning success of stocked MYYBrook Trout. Genetic determination of sex will inform ratio shifts from the expectednormalproportion ofmales in a wild population (i.e., 0.5).",
