 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the text body you provided, here are five keywords that summarize the main topics and themes:

1. Bottom of reach (BR) markers
2. Top of reach (TR) markers
3. Site location
4. Sampling
5. Marking site boundaries

Now, let's move on to the rest of your request.

2. Abstract:
Bottom of reach (BR) and top of reach (TR) markers are essential tools used in determining the location and boundaries of a sampling site. These markers help ensure that nearly all sites sampled have clear starting and ending points, which is crucial for collecting accurate data. The use of BR and TR markers streamlines the sampling process by providing a consistent method for monumenting site locations.

3. Description:
BR and TR markers serve to monument the site location and determine where to start and stop sampling. These markers are typically placed at the bottom and top of the reach, or area, being sampled. By using these markers, field crews can ensure that they collect data from consistent locations across multiple sites. This approach helps minimize errors and improves the accuracy of the data collected. In most cases, BR and TR markers will already be placed at the sampling sites, making it easier to begin the sampling process.

4. Target:
The primary goal of using BR and TR markers is to establish clear site boundaries for sampling and ensure consistency in data collection.

5. Constraints:
While BR and TR markers are essential tools for monumenting site locations and determining where to start and stop sampling, they do have some constraints. For example, they may not be suitable for use in areas with rapidly changing water levels or unstable banks, as the markers could become dislodged or submerged. Additionally, BR and TR markers may require regular maintenance to ensure that they remain in place and are visible above the water line.
