2. Abstract: This text discusses the importance of proper data collection and recording methods when studying turtle species in the Upper Mississippi River. By accurately recording data, researchers can ensure the success of long-term resource monitoring programs and minimize sampling errors. The use of electronic data entry has improved both the speed and accuracy of data collection.
3. Description: The text highlights the presence of 13 species and subspecies of turtles in the Upper Mississippi River, its backwaters, and tributaries. Some species are rarer than others, but it is important to correctly record all sightings for long-term resource monitoring programs. When sampling for fish, turtles can often be caught unintentionally, providing an opportunity to collect additional data about this important component of the ecosystem. Proper data recording and tracking procedures are essential, with all field staff responsible for understanding and complying with these procedures. The use of electronic data entry has improved the efficiency and accuracy of data collection by decreasing potential errors in raw, unreconciled data.
4. Target: To establish and implement proper data recording methods for turtle species research in the Upper Mississippi River.
5. Constraints: Ensuring compliance with data recording procedures can be challenging, as it requires all field staff to understand and follow these guidelines. The use of electronic data entry may also require adequate resources and training.
