2. Abstract: This method focuses on identifying and evaluating artificial fish passage barriers such as road crossings, dams, and fishways using remote sensing and field surveys. The WDFW (2000) protocols serve as a guide for conducting field surveys to identify potential barriers that hinder fish passage. A watershed-scale assessment of culverts is provided in Parker (2000), which further helps in understanding fish habitat connectivity. To ensure standardization, assessments are conducted annually during base-flow conditions, allowing for effective monitoring and prioritization of restoration projects to enhance fish habitats.

3. Description: The methodology consists of using remote sensing techniques like aerial photos or LANDSAT ETM+ as an initial screening process to locate possible barriers in the form of road crossings (culverts), dams, and fishways. After this preliminary assessment, field surveys are carried out following WDFW (2000) protocols for further evaluation of potential barriers. The WDFW (2000) manual is a crucial resource, providing detailed guidance on identifying, inventorying, and evaluating fish passage barriers to prioritize restoration projects effectively. Additionally, Parker (2000) focuses on culverts, offering insights into assessing fish habitat connectivity on a watershed scale, which contributes valuable information for the evaluation process. Annual assessments during base-flow conditions ensure consistent monitoring of fish passage barriers and facilitate well-informed decisions regarding restoration efforts.

4. Target: The primary focus is to evaluate and identify artificial fish passage barriers and prioritize watershed restoration projects based on their potential impact on fish habitats.

5. Constraints: This method requires access to specialized remote sensing tools, as well as familiarity with field survey protocols and the WDFW (2000) and Parker (2000) manuals. Time and resources must be allocated for annual assessments during base-flow conditions, which could present a constraint depending on local hydrological conditions and operational budgets.
