2. Abstract: Aerial photography and photo points are crucial tools for monitoring and assessing landscape features at specific sites. These methods provide a cost-effective alternative to more expensive technologies, enabling users to evaluate environmental changes over time without the need for specialized software or expertise. By documenting spatial changes in geomorphological features and vegetation communities, researchers can complement traditional statistical sampling methods and gain a more comprehensive understanding of site-specific environmental changes.
3. Description: Aerial photography and photo points serve as key tools for conducting quantitative measurements and qualitative assessments of landscape features at monitored sites. These methods are particularly useful for documenting spatial changes in geomorphological features, such as tidal channel evolution or the intertidal area, as well as vegetation communities, such as agricultural meadows vs. emergent marshes, at a site scale. Full-color or near-infrared aerial photographs are often publicly available through governmental agencies, providing a low-cost alternative for evaluating environmental change without image analysis software and remote sensing expertise. However, if funds and expertise are available, hyperspectral or multispectral satellite imagery or digital aerial photography can provide additional information. These methods are important for complementing less extensive statistical sampling methods and gaining a more comprehensive understanding of site-specific environmental changes over time.
4. Target: To provide a low-cost, accessible method for monitoring and assessing landscape features at monitored sites.
5. Constraints: The effectiveness of these methods may be limited by the availability of high-quality aerial photographs or satellite imagery, as well as the expertise required to analyze and interpret the data. Additionally, while these methods can provide valuable insights into site-specific environmental changes, they may not be suitable for all research questions or contexts.
