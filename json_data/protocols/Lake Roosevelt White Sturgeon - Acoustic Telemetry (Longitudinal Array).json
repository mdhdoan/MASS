  "background": "Since 2003, entities in the U.S. and Canada working collaboratively under the Upper Columbia White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative Transboundary Telemetry and Data Management Project have collectively acoustic tagged approximately 450 white sturgeon of various sizes and ages in the Transboundary Reach (Grand Coulee Dam in WA to HLK Dam in BC) of the Columbia River to monitor movements (e.g. spawning migrations) spawning fidelity, survival rates and seasonal habitat use (e.g. overwintering areas). Tagged sturgeon are passively tracked with a longitudinal array of acoustic receivers that has been developed and maintained by various U.S. and Canadian agencies that extends from Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state to HLK Dam in British Columbia. While a great deal of acoustic data has been collected to date, continued operation of the array is desirable. Manysturgeon have been outfitted withacoustic tags in both the US and Canadaand theseindividualsprovidethe opportunity to continue to build upon adata set that is meaningful in the context of long term sturgeon behavorial movements.In addtion, the maintenance of the array over the long term also provides the opportunity for its utilization by other researchers to conduct studies on other species of interest in Lake Roosevelt",
