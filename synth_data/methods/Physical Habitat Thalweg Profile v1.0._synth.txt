2. Abstract: This method, derived from the EMAP protocol, is used for monitoring and assessing the ecological condition of western wadable streams. It involves collecting stream channel measurements, such as wetted width, bed surface particle size, thalweg depth, and channel unit codes. The unique aspect of this method is measuring upstream distance in the middle of the channel instead of along the thalweg. This approach allows for the calculation of indices related to residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and habitat types such as riffles and pools, contributing to a better understanding of the stream's ecological condition.

3. Description: The method discussed is an environmental monitoring protocol derived from the EMAP protocol designed for western wadable streams. It includes detailed instructions for collecting stream channel measurements, focusing on the thalweg profile. The thalweg refers to the path of deepest water flow in a stream channel. A thalweg profile involves surveying maximum flow path depth and other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points along the support reach, measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from this profile enables calculations of various indices that provide insights into residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and habitat types like riffles and pools. This method differs from traditional approaches by measuring upstream distance in the middle of the channel instead of along the thalweg itself. Additional measurements include wetted width, bed surface particle classification, and determining channel unit codes and pool forming element codes.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to assess and monitor the ecological condition of western wadable streams by measuring specific stream channel characteristics.

5. Constraints: Possible constraints for this method could include limitations in accessibility to certain stream areas, time and resource constraints, or the need for specialized equipment and trained personnel to conduct the measurements accurately and safely.
