            "Moist soil management activities (tillage, planting, mowing, flooding, and burning) provide valuable habitat improvements for waterfowl and other wetland obligate species. At the TD-1 project waterfowl abundance counts have been occurring for three consecutive years to monitor spring migration and waterfowl response to increased habitat management through moist soil management. During the 2020 remote camera survey season 2 cameras were added to the TD-2 project area. The intention of the TD-2 project area was to create 71 acres of hemi marsh habitat to provide brood ponds for local waterfowl production. Currently with tall emergent vegetation and sedimentation wetlands in TD-2 are seeing very low amounts of waterfowl production. Our goal is to have cameras surveying the area to witness the positive response in waterfowl use as more habitat management occurs. In our study design biologists place elevated camera traps across habitats in a project area. Photos are taken every hour from sunrise to sunset and each camera trap has a measurable surface area (1 acre)to create sub-samples of density estimates across the project area."

Birds are good environmental monitors for several reasons: many species can be monitored simultaneously with a single method, methods for monitoring are well understood and standardized, birds occupy all habitat types, and as a community represent several trophic levels and habitat use guilds. Monitoring species abundance, community diversity, and trends provides information that can be used to determine the effectiveness of management actions in moving towards restoration goals.Point counts are the most widely used quantitative method used for monitoring land birds and involve an observer recording birds from a single point for a standardized time period (Ralph et al. 1995). The methodology follows recommendations by Ralph et al. (1995) and is consistent with that employed by the USDA Forest Service Northern Region Land Bird Monitoring Project (Hutto et al. 2001) and recommendations for the Idaho Partners in Flight Bird Monitoring Plan (Leukering et al. 2000). Fixed-radius plots (where the radius is arbitrarily small) reduce the interspecific difference in detectability by assuming that: a) all the birds within the fixed-radius are detectable; b) observers do not actively attract or repel birds; and c) birds do not move into or out of the fixed-radius plot during the counting period. This allows for comparisons of abundance among species. Unlimited radius plots maximize the amount of data collected because they include all detections and are appropriate when the objective is to monitor population changes within a single population (Ralph et al. 1995). Birds should be tallied in two distance bands, one 0-50 meters from the point center and one >50 meters from the point center. This maximizes data collection while permitting interspecific analysis. Additional information on establishing point count stations, data collection, and sample data forms can be found in Ralph et al. (1993), Ralph et al. (1995), and Huff et al. (2000)."

Avian predation rates can then be calculated based on the percentage of PIT-tagged juvenile salmonids released and/or detected passing hydroelectric dams that are subsequently consumed and deposited by birds on their nesting colonies. Because each PIT tag represents a unique fish, the tag recovery approach allows the testing of hypotheses on the effects of smolt morphology, condition, abundance, and origin on smolt vulnerability to avian predation."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks.

The RBT allows users to describe and measure river channels using high resolution digital elevation models (DEM). The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

The following criteria should be used when considering sections of channel for delineation as unique channel units: 1. In general, channel units are at least as long as the wetted channel width. 2. Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4. Falls, steps, and plunge pools are rarely as long as the wetted channel width, but should be delineated as separate channel units due to their importance as fish habitat and areas of topographic complexity."

It is designed for arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, dominated by willow and shrub-steppe. This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor the greenline before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation at the greenline.Streamside vegetation and GGW are significant indicators of the levels of incision and riparian health (Burton et al. 2011). Because changes occur most rapidly at the greenline due to high levels of disturbance, greenline vegetation data can be used to make early management decisions (Winward 2000). There are a variety of stream health indicators that can be assessed, using the data metrics collected at the greenline. For example: the presence or absence of deep rooted perennial vegetation can indicate how susceptible the streambank is to erosion; the types of hydrophilic species present can indicate the successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity; the abundance of invasive exotic species found at the greenline (due to high levels of disturbance) can indicate the degree to which the area is susceptible to the establishment of invasive species. Measuring the GGW will provide a more general view into landscape level changes. Over time, changing GGW indicates the degree of sediment aggradation occurring to create a wider stream networks, a key component to improving habitat complexity within and along narrow, incised channels (Pollock et al. 2007) and how quickly this change is occurring.Greenline data measurements are collected in pairs, one on each side of the channel, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1). The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton et al. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008). The measurements taken within the quadrat, in conjunction with information about each quadrats location along the reach, can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization (browse), and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

            "The RBT is a suite of GIS tools that work within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software. The RBT allows users to describe and measure river channels using high resolution digital elevation models (DEM). The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

            "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

In addition, because objectsviewed underwater are magnified about 1.3 times, accurately estimatingthe size of fish underwater requires practice.Snorkelers can practice estimating fish sizes byviewing objects and fish of known sizes underwater.Calibrated wooden dowels or floating cutouts of fishof various sizes can be attached to weights and distributedthroughout a stream channel. Snorkelers approach each object andestimate its size. Live fishof known size can also be used. One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size. Another method is to capture fish of severalsize classes and place them in temporary live cages(Rich 1993). Snorkelers independently view each fishand report their results to an instructor."

With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

            "The ability to see and count what is under the surface of the water without disturbing the habitat or the fish is a key advantage of hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can sample the entire water column quickly, and detailed maps of fish densities and mean sizes can be obtained over large bodies of water. As more area is encompassed by a sample, many of the sampling problems created by the spatial patchiness of fish distribution are alleviated. Thus, there tends to be less variation in density estimates across acoustic transects compared to purse-seine hauls or other gear types. Also, the frequency band used in scientific sonars (typically 38 to 200 kHz) is not detectable by most fishes (except see Mann et al. 2001; Gregory and Clabburn 2003). There remain limitations in the type of data that can be collected using hydroacoustics. Currently, single frequency hydroacoustics cannot identify the target species, though broadband and multifrequency sonar systems are showing promise in discerning species in low-diversity systems (Fernandes et al. 2003). Side-looking mobile hydroacoustics cannot discern modes in lengthfrequency distributions unless large differences in length classes exist. When these limitations are recognized, hydroacoustic sampling efforts are cost effective, as estimates from creel surveys are expensive and labor intensive, and the estimates developed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU) measures are not necessarily directly proportional to fish density (Hubert 1996:158159; Yule 2000). When used in concert with purse seining or other active sampling gears, hydroacoustics can provide a comprehensive survey method capable of providing valuable information on target size, population densities, and spatial distribution. Additional aspects of the strengths and limitations of acoustic surveys can be found in MacLennan and Simmonds (1992) and Brandt (1996)."

It is designed for arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, dominated by willow and shrub-steppe. This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor the greenline before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation at the greenline.Streamside vegetation and GGW are significant indicators of the levels of incision and riparian health (Burton et al. 2011). Because changes occur most rapidly at the greenline due to high levels of disturbance, greenline vegetation data can be used to make early management decisions (Winward 2000). There are a variety of stream health indicators that can be assessed, using the data metrics collected at the greenline. For example: the presence or absence of deep rooted perennial vegetation can indicate how susceptible the streambank is to erosion; the types of hydrophilic species present can indicate the successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity; the abundance of invasive exotic species found at the greenline (due to high levels of disturbance) can indicate the degree to which the area is susceptible to the establishment of invasive species. Measuring the GGW will provide a more general view into landscape level changes. Over time, changing GGW indicates the degree of sediment aggradation occurring to create a wider stream networks, a key component to improving habitat complexity within and along narrow, incised channels (Pollock et al. 2007) and how quickly this change is occurring.Greenline data measurements are collected in pairs, one on each side of the channel, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1). The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton et al. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008). The measurements taken within the quadrat, in conjunction with information about each quadrats location along the reach, can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization (browse), and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence."

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993).

The definition applied here is from the ODFW habitat survey manual (Moore et al. 1999): an area with generally uniform depth and flow with no surface turbulence, generally in reaches of <1% gradient. Glides may have some small scour areas but are distinguished from pools by their overall homogeneity and lack of structure. They are generally deeper than riffles with few major flow obstructions and low habitat complexity.Large Cobble/Boulder RifflePercentage of the wetted channel surface area comprising large cobble/boulder riffles. Particle sizes of substrate modified from Platts et al. (1983): gravel (0.2 to 2.9 inch diameter), small cobble (2.9 to 5 inch diameter), large cobble (5 to 11.9 inch diameter), boulder (>11.9 inch diameter). Cascades are included in this habitat type for the purposes of the EDT analysis.Pool TailoutsPercentage of the wetted channel surface area comprising pool tailouts. Pool-tailouts are a primary spawning habitat for nearly all salmonids.Primary PoolPercentage of the wetted channel surface area comprising pools, excluding beaver ponds. Pools serve as key habitat for some life stages of virtually all salmonids.Small Cobble/Gravel RifflePercentage of the wetted channel surface area comprising small cobble/gravel riffles. Particle sizes of substrate modified from Platts et al. (1983): gravel (0.2 to 2.9 inch diameter), small cobble (2.9 to 5 inch diameter), large cobble (5 to 11.9 inch diameter), boulder (>11.9 inch diameter).Off-Channel HabitatA multiplier used to estimate the amount of off-channel habitat based on the wetted surface area of the all combined in-channel habitat. Off-channel habitat consists of oxbows, back swamps, riverine ponds, and the channels that connect them to the main channel or its side channels.Off-channel habitat is not a percent, rather, it is a multiplier used to estimate the amount of off-channel habitat based on the wetted surface area of the all combined in-channel habitat. To calculate the off-channel habitat factor, divide the total length of off-channel habitat by the total length of the reach."

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

The RBT allows users to describe and measure river channels using high resolution digital elevation models (DEM). The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat.

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

We propose to take advantage of a new hierarchal Bayesian modeling approach to estimate predator abundance in the Columbia River between Priest Rapids and McNary dams (Korman et al. 2016). Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled). A more detailed description of the field methods, model structure and assumptions is provide below."

It is designed for arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, dominated by willow and shrub-steppe. This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor floodplain vegetation response before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation with increasing distance from the main channel. These methods can be completed in conjunction with the Floodplain Vegetation Monitoring Greenline Data Collection methods.In riparian areas, change is continuous due to flux in stream flow and sediment aggregation, resulting in pronounced changes in successional vegetation (Windward 2000). Monitoring the change in vegetation communities and at what distance these changes are occurring with respect to the main channel create a cross-section portrait of the riparian zone over time. Observing the relative abundance of hydric, riparian, and upland species with respect to distance from the main channel defines the extent and characterizes the riparian area with respect to local flora communities typical for the area (Crawford 2003). Over time, changes reveal whether floodplains are expanding and becoming further inundated as is shown to occur in the presence of damming high levels of beaver activity (Pollock, et al. 2014). In addition to measuring changes in vegetative composition and abundance at various distances from the main channel, these methods aid in tracking beaver forage radius and woody species recruitment rates at study sites with beaver activity.Transect data measurements are collected within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1), with the first quadrat beginning at the greenline, and 3-5 quadrat measurements within one transect. A transect is laid out starting at the greenline and distance along the transect is measured by walking away from the greenline, perpendicular to stream flow. The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton, T.A., S.J. Smith, and E.R. Cowley. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008)."

This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor the greenline before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation at the greenline.Streamside vegetation and GGW are significant indicators of the levels of incision and riparian health (Burton et al. 2011). Because changes occur most rapidly at the greenline due to high levels of disturbance, greenline vegetation data can be used to make early management decisions (Winward 2000). There are a variety of stream health indicators that can be assessed, using the data metrics collected at the greenline. For example: the presence or absence of deep rooted perennial vegetation can indicate how susceptible the streambank is to erosion; the types of hydrophilic species present can indicate the successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity; the abundance of invasive exotic species found at the greenline (due to high levels of disturbance) can indicate the degree to which the area is susceptible to the establishment of invasive species. Measuring the GGW will provide a more general view into landscape level changes. Over time, changing GGW indicates the degree of sediment aggradation occurring to create a wider stream networks, a key component to improving habitat complexity within and along narrow, incised channels (Pollock et al. 2007) and how quickly this change is occurring.Greenline data measurements are collected in pairs, one on each side of the channel, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1). The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton et al. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008). The measurements taken within the quadrat, in conjunction with information about each quadrats location along the reach, can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization (browse), and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence."

Surveys will be conducted utilizing Smith-Root LR-24 24 volt backpack units fitted with 11 ring anodes and rat-tail cathodes.  These electrofishing units will be programmed to output pulsed DC current with frequency, duty cycle, and voltage settings adjusted relative to reach conductivity and temperature.  Each electrofishing crew will consist of one operator and two netters, assignment of duties remaining fixed throughout the project.  Double block nets (1/4 in. mesh) will be deployed at the upper and lower ends of transects subject to closed-population modeling.  Electrofishing will begin at the bottom of each transect and move upstream, with shocked fish being netted.   Single pass electrofishing occurs in much the same manner, but no block nets are used and no fish are marked."

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993).

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Data from the thalweg profile allows calculation of indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools.

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Progeny from any of these parents (either collected as juveniles or returning adults), if genotyped, could be assigned back to their parents, thus identifying the hatchery they originated from and exact brood year they were produced in (Anderson and Garza 2005; Steele et al 2011). Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

In addition, because objectsviewed underwater are magnified about 1.3 times, accurately estimatingthe size of fish underwater requires practice.Snorkelers can practice estimating fish sizes byviewing objects and fish of known sizes underwater.Calibrated wooden dowels or floating cutouts of fishof various sizes can be attached to weights and distributedthroughout a stream channel. Snorkelers approach each object andestimate its size. Live fishof known size can also be used. One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size. Another method is to capture fish of severalsize classes and place them in temporary live cages(Rich 1993). Snorkelers independently view each fishand report their results to an instructor."

With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

            "It is often difficult for fisheries researchers and managers to obtain a numeric estimate of a given fish stock fora variety of reasons (e.g., time, funding, logistics, etc.). In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

Snorkelers approach each object andestimate its size. Live fishof known size can also be used. One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size.

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

The thalweg profile is a longitudinal survey of maximum flow path depth and several other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points (termed stations) along the length of the support reach measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from the thalweg profile allows calculation of indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools.

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993). Additional insights into use of gill nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

Snorkelers approach each object andestimate its size. Live fishof known size can also be used. One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size.

When researchers want to compare fish lengths of male spawners versus female spawners or hatchery spawned females versus carcasses, it is a good idea to use this type of length measurement to remove the bias of the eroded tails on female spawners.  So length measurements are made from specific parts of the body that are intact, such as the orbit and the hypural plate.

The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993).

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

The thalweg profile is a longitudinal survey of maximum flow path depth and several other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points (termed stations) along the length of the support reach measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from the thalweg profile allows calculation of indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools. This habitat assessment modifies traditional methods by measuring upstream distance in the middle of the channel, rather than along the thalweg itself (though each thalweg depth measurement is taken at the point of the deepest flow path at each station).Overview: method activities/data collected1.

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

In response to predation concerns, actions were taken to evaluate predator reduction strategies and eventually an aggressive predator removal program was implemented in 2006 aimed at collapsing the lake trout population and temporarily reducing the rainbow trout population. A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used.Netting cannot be used to effectively capture rainbow trout, so the AIP is essentially the sole method to reduce rainbow trout predation on kokanee. Additionally, population modeling suggested angling was a critical component needed to effectively collapse the lake trout population (Hansen et al. 2010)."

The relation between CPUE and timing of downstream dispersal for Snake River fall Chinook salmonOncorhynchus tshawytschajuveniles was first described by Connor et al. (2013; Figure 5 inset). It was concluded that timing of downstream dispersal became later as relative abundance along the shorelines increased.

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

The RBT allows users to describe and measure river channels using high resolution digital elevation models (DEM). The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.

            "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream.

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled). A more detailed description of the field methods, model structure and assumptions is provide below."

Data for population estimates, survival, and migration timing can be gathered with PTISs. PIT tagging of anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin is a primary tool used by researchers, and instream PTIS have become a key tool in such research. Because of the limits of tag size and read speed required at hydroelectid facilities, most anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin are tagged with full duplex 134.2 kHz 12-mm PIT tags. Use of PTISs allow researchers to tag and follow cohorts of fish from parr size to return as adults. Detection data from PIT-tagged fish may be used for population estimates,behavioral studies, or caluclation of life-stage specific survival rates."

Tagging of Steelhead parr at age-0 or age-1 with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags and subsequent recaptures of those fish allows individual identification of fish and calculation of growth sesonally or annually. Relative growth is simply growth as a percent of fish length or weight at initial tagging (Lugert et al. 2016), and is useful because fish of the same cohort vary in size even in the same location. For instance, two age-0 steelhead might be tagged at a location, one might be 55 mm Fork Length (FL), the other might be 60 mm FL. Both fish might be recatpured two months later having both grown by 2 mm. Thoughchange in length was the same (2 mm), the 55 mm fish grew more relative to it's initial length. With age-0 and age-1 salmonids in a field setting, FL should be measured to the nearest mm and weight to the nearest 0.1 g."

Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4. Falls, steps, and plunge pools are rarely as long as the wetted channel width, but should be delineated as separate channel units due to their importance as fish habitat and areas of topographic complexity."

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

            "One of the first tests that geneticists perform on a dataset is to measure whether the genotypes in the sample are present in the expected proportions given the observed allele frequencies.  They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

This includes information about the genetic linkage of markers, selection, the rate of recombination, the rate of mutation, genetic drift, non-random mating, and population structure.When genetic linkage is suspected (a pair of loci exhibit strong LD across multiple populations) often only the one with the highest allele frequency is retained.  If LD is observed between many pairs of loci within the same population, the population may be dropped since many statistical tests assume equilibrium within populations."

Gill nets are one of the most commonly used gears to collect fish and can be used in a variety of different ways including floating, sinking, suspended, vertical, set, or drifted. Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

Typically, trap nets are biased towards capturing larger, more active fish. One benefit to trap nets is they have essentially zero mortality, with the rare exception of a small fish that becomes stuck in the trap mesh. Therefore, trap nets are effective for capturing fish to be used for other purposes (e.g., telemetry, population estimates), and the nets are easily standardized for catch rate trend analyses. Large versions of trap nets have been used in commercial fisheries in the Great Lakes for many years. More details on the use of trap nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

            "Discriminant function analysis (DFA)is used to determine which continuous variables discriminate (e.g., differentiate) between two or more groupings. More simply, DFAis useful for determining whether a set of variables is effective in predicting category membership. Discriminant function analysis is the preferred and most commonly used multivariate assignment techniquewhen dealing with isotopic ratio data with the intent of assigning fish to an origin location (Nowling et al. 2011; Gahagan et al. 2012). Discriminant function analysis maintains the following assumptions that should be considered, although this technique is typically robust to slight violations of these assumptions.1) multivariate normality2) homoscedasticity3) non-multicollinearity4) independenceThe following text was paraphrased from Poulsen and French (http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/discrim/discrim.pdf)Discriminant function analysis can be broken into two steps. The first step is testing the significance of a set of discriminant functions. The second step is classification.In the first step there is a matrix of total variances and covariances, and there is also a matrix of pooled within-group variances and covariances. The two matrices are compared via multivariate F tests in order to determine whether or not there are any significant differences (with regard to all variables) between groups. The multivariate test is performed first to determine which of the variables have significantly different means across the groups. Once group means are found to be statistically significant, classification of variables is undertaken. Discriminant function analysis automatically determines some optimal combination of variables so that the first function provides the most overall discrimination between groups, the second provides second most, and so on. Moreover, the functions will be independent or orthogonal, that is, their contributions to the discrimination between groups will not overlap. The first function picks up the most variation; the second function picks up the greatest part of the unexplained variation, etc. Computationally, a canonical correlation analysis is performed that will determine the successive functions and canonical roots. Classification is then possible from the canonical functions. Subjects are classified in the groups in which they had the highest classification scores. The maximum number of discriminant functions will be equal to the degrees of freedom, or the number of variables in the analysis, whichever is smaller."

The length measurement of choice will depend on the species of interest. For example, a larval mayfly might have its total length measured whereas a crayfish might just have its carapace length measured. The number of individuals measured will also depend on the final use of the data and the amount of length variability in the population. For example, a sample size of 100 individuals might be adequate for generating a length-weight regression, but a sample size of 500 individuals might be more appropriate for discerning the age structure of a population for which many length bins are used.

Diets can be analyzed in a number of ways depending on different study objectives. Quantifying the proportions of different prey in an invertebrate's stomach is difficult do to their small size. The approach described here relies on examination of macroinvertebrate gut contents and provides a quasi-quantitative description of the diet based on estimating the proportion of different prey in the cells of a Sedgewick-Rafter slide."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4.

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993). Additional insights into use of gill nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water).

            "Entrapment gears such as trap nets are commonly used in fisheries studies to capture species that are mobile and willing to follow leads into the trap. Typically, trap nets are biased towards capturing larger, more active fish. One benefit to trap nets is they have essentially zero mortality, with the rare exception of a small fish that becomes stuck in the trap mesh. Therefore, trap nets are effective for capturing fish to be used for other purposes (e.g., telemetry, population estimates), and the nets are easily standardized for catch rate trend analyses. Large versions of trap nets have been used in commercial fisheries in the Great Lakes for many years. More details on the use of trap nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

Tools were created for ArcGIS to conduct several types of analyses associated with DEMs, including geomorphic change detection, uncertainty analyses, user-defined density of cross-sections and longitudinal profiles.

            "In order to determine fish lengths (for adults and juveniles)during underwater activities when it is not feasible to use a measuring board, such as snorkeling,researchers will need to accurately estimate total length. In addition, because objectsviewed underwater are magnified about 1.3 times, accurately estimatingthe size of fish underwater requires practice.Snorkelers can practice estimating fish sizes byviewing objects and fish of known sizes underwater.Calibrated wooden dowels or floating cutouts of fishof various sizes can be attached to weights and distributedthroughout a stream channel. Snorkelers approach each object andestimate its size. Live fishof known size can also be used. One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size. Another method is to capture fish of severalsize classes and place them in temporary live cages(Rich 1993). Snorkelers independently view each fishand report their results to an instructor."

The RBT is being actively developed by ESSA Technologies and is available for free. The goal is to characterize in-stream and floodplain geomorphology to support aquatic habitat analyses and numerical models of flow and sediment transport. Tools were created for ArcGIS to conduct several types of analyses associated with DEMs, including geomorphic change detection, uncertainty analyses, user-defined density of cross-sections and longitudinal profiles. These tools can extract hydrologic parameters such as wetted area, bankfull width, water depths, hydraulic radius, gradient, sinuosity (McKean et al. 2009), erosion and depositional patterns and budgets, and uncertainty in the DEM (Wheaton et al. 2010). Using an automated detrending algorithm we are able to remove the overall valley slope. Tools are being created that use the detrended raster to investigate flooding outside a main channel at any prescribed discharge or flow stage. The RBT will also allow users to recreate other survey protocols that use cross-sectional and longitudinal profile approaches. The CHaMP - Topographic Point Collection Methods (Method ID:5328) provides background on collection of the X, Y, Z point measurement data used to generated the DEM that is analyzed for this calculation."

A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used.Netting cannot be used to effectively capture rainbow trout, so the AIP is essentially the sole method to reduce rainbow trout predation on kokanee. Additionally, population modeling suggested angling was a critical component needed to effectively collapse the lake trout population (Hansen et al. 2010)."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

Therefore, trap nets are effective for capturing fish to be used for other purposes (e.g., telemetry, population estimates), and the nets are easily standardized for catch rate trend analyses. Large versions of trap nets have been used in commercial fisheries in the Great Lakes for many years. More details on the use of trap nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

Gill nets are one of the most commonly used gears to collect fish and can be used in a variety of different ways including floating, sinking, suspended, vertical, set, or drifted. Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes. Similarly, a different approach would be to replicate the methods and equipment used by these companies."

Here we attempt to provide schematics of various scenarios to help visually explain genetic tagging rates.Managers are likely already familiar with tagging rates as they apply to traditional physical tagging technologies, such as CWTs. Determining tagging rate is usually straightforward for physical tags because the total number of hatchery-produced fish is enumerated, a subset of the total is then counted and tagged allowing a direct measure of tagging rate to be calculated. With genetic tagging the approach is inherently different because the parental broodstock, not the progeny, are used to calculate a tagging rate. Both the male and female broodstock in any particular spawning cross must be genetically sampled and successfully genotyped in order for their progeny to be PBT tagged.If all parents are sampled, and all samples are successfully genotyped, then the stock is 100% PBT tagged (e.g. all offspring can be assigned back to their parents). Genotypes from each parent are needed to conduct PBT and the failure to sample or genotype either parent from a spawning cross drives down the overall tagging rate for a stock. PBT Tagging rates that are <100% are not problematic for conducting PBT but rates <100% must be estimated. There are several simple methods used to estimate tagging rates, each with its own assumptions.Here we review the various ways PBT tagging rates can be estimated and illustrate that some methods provide a more accurate estimate of tagging rate under certain scenarios of incomplete broodstock sampling."

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

The direction of a fish movement was classified as top, bottom, left or right, with each consisting of a ninety-degree range centered at the focal point (Figure 1). Movements were classified as either feeding or agonistic depending upon whether the focal fish 1) obtained a food item, or 2) moved aggressively as an instigator or in response to an intruding Chinook. Feeding strikes were denoted by a dark circle or point on the datasheet, and agonistic strikes with an x. (Johnson et. al. 2012)"

            "It is often difficult for fisheries researchers and managers to obtain a numeric estimate of a given fish stock fora variety of reasons (e.g., time, funding, logistics, etc.). In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993).

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3.

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

            "In the past, we have estimated salmonid abundances using multiple-pass removal depletion methods. Though multipass-depletion estimates are useful for examining site-specific temporal trends, the large degree of within-year variability among site estimates that has commonly been documented in our surveys does not permit a reliable examination of abundance when estimates are expanded to larger spatial scales (Firehammer et al. 2009). Because of this shortcoming and the desire to increase sampling efficiency, an index of site abundance was preferable to an absolute estimate, and was found to track true abundance over time (Firehammer et al. 2011). Others have also found single-pass indices to perform well in predicting abundances for salmonid populations in small-streams (Jones and Stockwell 1995; Kruse et al. 1998; Bateman et al. 2005). More importantly, we found that depletion estimates underestimated the true abundance, primarily as a result of an overestimation of capture probability during subsequent passes, which was consistent with other studies that documented biases associated with depletion-removal estimates for salmonids in small stream systems (Peterson et al. 2004; Rosenberger and Dunham 2005). Results from trend analyses also indicated that first pass catch data provided similar interpretations of watershed-wide abundance trends in salmonids as did our removal-depletion estimates (Firehammer et al. 2011). These results lend support to using first-pass catch rather than multi-pass depletion estimates to examine long-term reach trajectories in our watersheds."

A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used.Netting cannot be used to effectively capture rainbow trout, so the AIP is essentially the sole method to reduce rainbow trout predation on kokanee. Additionally, population modeling suggested angling was a critical component needed to effectively collapse the lake trout population (Hansen et al. 2010)."

            "Beach and pole seining can be an efficient method to capture fishes in a wide variety of habitats, including rivers, estuarine, and nearshore lake, reservoir, and marine habitats (Pierce et al. 1990). It is most effective when used in relatively shallow water with few obstructions, where fish are in high concentrations, and for species that are less likely to outswim the net; however, in some circumstances seining can capture highly mobile species such as adult salmon. Seining permits the sampling of relatively large areas in short periods of time as well as the capture and release of fish without significant stress or harm, as long as the bunt of the seine is kept in water and the fish are not too crowded (or fish are quickly moved to a holding container). Cost of gear, boats, and personnel range from relatively inexpensive to modest, depending on the scope and frequency of sampling.Seining may be carried out in a variety of habitat types, depending on the population and life stage of the targeted species. Sites with irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, or dense stands of aquatic vegetation may not be suitable for seining due to net snagging or lifting and reduced fish retention. Current velocity and depth influence site selection and choice of net design. Seines vary in size and design. To help understand what affects selectivity and capture efficiencyand therefore, effectiveness of seiningwe considered the following categories: habitat, water, fish, time of year and day, net, and method. Considering these factors in your study design before you sample and after you begin sampling (by underwater observation and calibration studies) will help you to decide when seining may be a good technique to meet your objectives; it will also help improve the analysis of data collected.Perpendicular set beach seining may be used for fish/area or fish/volume analysis (length, width, and depth must be measured), but fish/set is appropriate only if the distance pulled is consistent. The poles may be marked with 0.1-m-depth increments to facilitate measuring the water depth at the offshore end of the seine (note: take an average of two or more depths). To ensure consistent width of swept area, a rope of known length can be attached to the upper end of each pole (DE in Figure 1) and stretched tight during seining."

We propose to take advantage of a new hierarchal Bayesian modeling approach to estimate predator abundance in the Columbia River between Priest Rapids and McNary dams (Korman et al. 2016). Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

For instance, two age-0 steelhead might be tagged at a location, one might be 55 mm Fork Length (FL), the other might be 60 mm FL. Both fish might be recatpured two months later having both grown by 2 mm. Thoughchange in length was the same (2 mm), the 55 mm fish grew more relative to it's initial length.

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

Adult and juvenile Caspian terns and double-crested cormorants can be captured and banded with field readable leg bands to measure survival, post-breeding dispersal, movements among colonies, age of first breeding, relative dispersal, and the effects of disturbance or dissuasion. Demography and dispersal data is a key component of evaluating the efficacy of management actions to relocate tern and cormorant colonies that pose a risk to the survival of juvenile salmonids and other fish of conservation concern in the Columbia River estuary. Data derived from banding and band resighting is also paramount to our basic understanding of avian biology and ecology. Tern bands resighted by the public or by other, non-project staff at sites throughout North America can be reported via www.mybandedtern.org, a web site dedicated to previously banded Caspian terns. A similar web site for double-crested cormorants may also soon be available. Additional details about banding efforts and the data derived from them can be found in Suzuki (2012)."

Typically, fish must be large enough to accept an anchortag. For example, for a fish like a smallmouth bass, a 150 mm fish can easily accept a40 mmtag. Fish to be tagged may or may not be anesthetized first, and will depend on the species and how quickly they can be handled during the tagging process.Anchor tags are composed of a T-shaped (T-bar) or barbed (dart) attachment end that is embedded in the fish. The other end is a colored plastic tube or streamer that typically has information about the project printed on it (Zale et al. 2012).

Occasionally carcass only surveys are conducted to increase recovery rates, to monitor mortality prior to spawning (i.e., pre-spawn mortality) or to opportunistically sample spawning areas surveyed aerially. When conducting surveys, observers carefully scan the stream for carcasses. Carcasses may be difficult to detect as they may be covered in silt or fungus, located in log jams or deep pools, or located out of the water on the stream bank. When carcasses are found they are recovered and processed utilizing a similar collection methodology. All data is recorded on a standardized datasheetusing database acceptable values.

Surveys are normally conducted from mid-morning until late afternoon, on clear, sunny days when redd visibility is good and avoided on extremely overcast days, in the rain or when water clarity or overhead light conditions compromise the observers ability to detect redds.Stream transects are surveyed once (i.e., single pass) or as a multiple-pass surveys which allow surveyors to observe the progression of redd construction. Multiple-pass surveys are conducted in intensively monitored streams and preferred over single-pass surveys because they minimize redd enumeration errors in heavily spawned areas, provide an indication of spawn timing, and generate more carcasses which improve the biological representation of the overall return."

The relation between CPUE and timing of downstream dispersal for Snake River fall Chinook salmonOncorhynchus tshawytschajuveniles was first described by Connor et al. (2013; Figure 5 inset). It was concluded that timing of downstream dispersal became later as relative abundance along the shorelines increased.

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4.

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Because of this shortcoming and the desire to increase sampling efficiency, an index of site abundance was preferable to an absolute estimate, and was found to track true abundance over time (Firehammer et al. 2011). Others have also found single-pass indices to perform well in predicting abundances for salmonid populations in small-streams (Jones and Stockwell 1995; Kruse et al. 1998; Bateman et al. 2005). More importantly, we found that depletion estimates underestimated the true abundance, primarily as a result of an overestimation of capture probability during subsequent passes, which was consistent with other studies that documented biases associated with depletion-removal estimates for salmonids in small stream systems (Peterson et al. 2004; Rosenberger and Dunham 2005). Results from trend analyses also indicated that first pass catch data provided similar interpretations of watershed-wide abundance trends in salmonids as did our removal-depletion estimates (Firehammer et al. 2011). These results lend support to using first-pass catch rather than multi-pass depletion estimates to examine long-term reach trajectories in our watersheds."

We propose to take advantage of a new hierarchal Bayesian modeling approach to estimate predator abundance in the Columbia River between Priest Rapids and McNary dams (Korman et al. 2016). Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled). A more detailed description of the field methods, model structure and assumptions is provide below."

Tagging of Steelhead parr at age-0 or age-1 with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags and subsequent recaptures of those fish allows individual identification of fish and calculation of growth sesonally or annually. Relative growth is simply growth as a percent of fish length or weight at initial tagging (Lugert et al. 2016), and is useful because fish of the same cohort vary in size even in the same location. For instance, two age-0 steelhead might be tagged at a location, one might be 55 mm Fork Length (FL), the other might be 60 mm FL. Both fish might be recatpured two months later having both grown by 2 mm. Thoughchange in length was the same (2 mm), the 55 mm fish grew more relative to it's initial length. With age-0 and age-1 salmonids in a field setting, FL should be measured to the nearest mm and weight to the nearest 0.1 g."

In response to predation concerns, actions were taken to evaluate predator reduction strategies and eventually an aggressive predator removal program was implemented in 2006 aimed at collapsing the lake trout population and temporarily reducing the rainbow trout population. A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used.Netting cannot be used to effectively capture rainbow trout, so the AIP is essentially the sole method to reduce rainbow trout predation on kokanee. Additionally, population modeling suggested angling was a critical component needed to effectively collapse the lake trout population (Hansen et al. 2010)."

Expanded stock and age composition of landings post-season are used to describeand compare fishery performanceamong years.Salmon that are inspected during fisheries sampling receive a visual stock identification (VSI), based on phenotypic characteristics and fin marks (see Protocol 3577: Fisheries Sampling for the Select Area Fisheries Enhancement (SAFE) Program, for example). Stock calls are confirmed with recovered coded-wire tags, when possible, and used to make corrections. From the proportion of correct and incorrect VSIs, correction factors are applied to non-CWT VSIs. Stock calls and corrections are tracked closely when an ESA-listed stock of salmon is part of a mixed-stock fishery, which occurs in a short time frame to aid in-season management. Scales samples that are collected during fishery sampling are sent to agency labs, mounted, read, agesrecorded, and expanded to landings."

We propose to take advantage of a new hierarchal Bayesian modeling approach to estimate predator abundance in the Columbia River between Priest Rapids and McNary dams (Korman et al. 2016). Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Gill nets are one of the most commonly used gears to collect fish and can be used in a variety of different ways including floating, sinking, suspended, vertical, set, or drifted. Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes. Similarly, a different approach would be to replicate the methods and equipment used by these companies."

As such, a full understanding of the life history variation displayed in a population is required to understand the risks to the population and how best to manage those risks.Because most salmonids have overlapping generations, much of the variability is reduced, and therefore the population is more resilient.The age at emigration of anadromous salmonids may have implications related to early marine survival, hydrosystem survival, early maturation, and predation among other impacts. Understanding the age of emigrating juvenile smolts will allow the researcher to better understand the effects of age on sources of mortality and life history in general."

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3.

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water).

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

An opercle punch was chosen as an appropriate mark in our studies whereby we were estimating abundance of spring spawning salmonids. During the spring, water temperatures are cold enough so that the hole created by the punch would not heal over quickly during the time period prior to recapture (i.e., 2-4 weeks). Thus, the mark would not be lost and it would be recognizable upon recapture. Furthermore, the tool used to create the punch was small so that it was not an intrusive procedure for the fish and the hole it created was not unusually large for the size of trout marked. Therefore, we felt it would not unduly affect the behavior or survivability of the fish."

Surveys are normally conducted from mid-morning until late afternoon, on clear, sunny days when redd visibility is good and avoided on extremely overcast days, in the rain or when water clarity or overhead light conditions compromise the observers ability to detect redds.Stream transects are surveyed once (i.e., single pass) or as a multiple-pass surveys which allow surveyors to observe the progression of redd construction. Multiple-pass surveys are conducted in intensively monitored streams and preferred over single-pass surveys because they minimize redd enumeration errors in heavily spawned areas, provide an indication of spawn timing, and generate more carcasses which improve the biological representation of the overall return."

The number of individuals measured will also depend on the final use of the data and the amount of length variability in the population. For example, a sample size of 100 individuals might be adequate for generating a length-weight regression, but a sample size of 500 individuals might be more appropriate for discerning the age structure of a population for which many length bins are used. This describes a general method for measuring the length of an invertebrate and should be customized based on the species of interest."

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled). A more detailed description of the field methods, model structure and assumptions is provide below."

Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4.

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

Data is collected from all observed salmon, steelhead and Bull Trout, however, steelhead and Bull Trout carcasses are rarely encountered. Occasionally carcass only surveys are conducted to increase recovery rates, to monitor mortality prior to spawning (i.e., pre-spawn mortality) or to opportunistically sample spawning areas surveyed aerially. When conducting surveys, observers carefully scan the stream for carcasses. Carcasses may be difficult to detect as they may be covered in silt or fungus, located in log jams or deep pools, or located out of the water on the stream bank. When carcasses are found they are recovered and processed utilizing a similar collection methodology. All data is recorded on a standardized datasheetusing database acceptable values. Standardized carcass processing consists of collecting georeferenced locations, recording and collecting biological data, and visually and electronically checking for marks and tags."

Surveys are normally conducted from mid-morning until late afternoon, on clear, sunny days when redd visibility is good and avoided on extremely overcast days, in the rain or when water clarity or overhead light conditions compromise the observers ability to detect redds.Stream transects are surveyed once (i.e., single pass) or as a multiple-pass surveys which allow surveyors to observe the progression of redd construction. Multiple-pass surveys are conducted in intensively monitored streams and preferred over single-pass surveys because they minimize redd enumeration errors in heavily spawned areas, provide an indication of spawn timing, and generate more carcasses which improve the biological representation of the overall return."

The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993).

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.

Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.

Population estimates and post spawn survival estimates could then be derived for each creek."

Tagging of Steelhead parr at age-0 or age-1 with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags and subsequent recaptures of those fish allows individual identification of fish and calculation of growth sesonally or annually. Relative growth is simply growth as a percent of fish length or weight at initial tagging (Lugert et al. 2016), and is useful because fish of the same cohort vary in size even in the same location. For instance, two age-0 steelhead might be tagged at a location, one might be 55 mm Fork Length (FL), the other might be 60 mm FL. Both fish might be recatpured two months later having both grown by 2 mm. Thoughchange in length was the same (2 mm), the 55 mm fish grew more relative to it's initial length. With age-0 and age-1 salmonids in a field setting, FL should be measured to the nearest mm and weight to the nearest 0.1 g."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4.

Because GRTS sites are spatially balanced across a given population, visiting sites can be logistically challenging and require careful planning. GRTS surveys can beconducted annually or infrequently depending upon the survey design and objective. Annual sites can target drainages that have juvenile emigrant traps, and as a results snorkelsurveys can be used to calibrate parr densities with production of juvenile emigrants estimated from traps (Copeland et al. 2013). A unique design number provided for all probabilistic sites serves as the site name, with the lowest design numbers having the highest priority for survey.Information on spatial distribution is required for Endangered Species Act (ESA) status reviews (McElhany et al. 2000). And GRTS snorkel surveys canfill this need. In particular, GRTS surveys can beused to establish fish distribution and relative abundance at a larger spatial scale generally sampled within a single year. Although GRTS surveys may span several years if all sites could not be surveyed in a single year. Data collected GRTS surveys often might represent the most complete fish assemblage and distribution information, particularly forremote, and mostly inaccessible basins. Over time GRTS surveys cancoverthe majority of available habitat for steelhead and Chinook Salmon, therebyfilling a large data gap for these species and other salmonids.Occupancy information is useful for programs prioritizing habitat restoration projects for both resident and anadromous fish."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water).

Because GRTS sites are spatially balanced across a given population, visiting sites can be logistically challenging and require careful planning. GRTS surveys can beconducted annually or infrequently depending upon the survey design and objective. Annual sites can target drainages that have juvenile emigrant traps, and as a results snorkelsurveys can be used to calibrate parr densities with production of juvenile emigrants estimated from traps (Copeland et al. 2013). A unique design number provided for all probabilistic sites serves as the site name, with the lowest design numbers having the highest priority for survey.Information on spatial distribution is required for Endangered Species Act (ESA) status reviews (McElhany et al. 2000). And GRTS snorkel surveys canfill this need. In particular, GRTS surveys can beused to establish fish distribution and relative abundance at a larger spatial scale generally sampled within a single year. Although GRTS surveys may span several years if all sites could not be surveyed in a single year. Data collected GRTS surveys often might represent the most complete fish assemblage and distribution information, particularly forremote, and mostly inaccessible basins. Over time GRTS surveys cancoverthe majority of available habitat for steelhead and Chinook Salmon, therebyfilling a large data gap for these species and other salmonids.Occupancy information is useful for programs prioritizing habitat restoration projects for both resident and anadromous fish."

Adultmusselsmay also be completely buried insediments and not detectable without excavationduring high flows. Freshwater mussels are only in permanently wetted areas of a stream or river, thus conducting mussel surveys during typical low water levels reduces potential areas to survey, and helps focus efforts only in the permanently wetted areas where mussels will persist. Areas of high mussel density should be snorkeled to avoid crushing or disturbingmussels by wading methods.Snorkeling to observe freshwater mussels differs in several ways to snorkel surveys to observe fish, as freshwater mussels are stationary in the timescale required to survey a stream reach, and may be mostly buried in sediments with only 0.5 to ~5 centimeters of inhalant or exhalent aperture soft tissues visible.Freshwater mussel genuscan be determined byobservation ofpapillaearound theinhalantaperture for many rivers in the Pacific region (see Haag 2012, andBlevins et al. 2017 for information aboutSinanodonta beringiana), thus in conditions ofgood visibility, extraction and handling ofan observed mussel are not required.Many musselbeds onlycontain one species, making handling of individual animals for identification unnecessary.

            "One of the first tests that geneticists perform on a dataset is to measure whether the genotypes in the sample are present in the expected proportions given the observed allele frequencies.  They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

Geneticists are interested in estimating the level of linkage disequilibrium because it can tell information about both the genetic markers that are being used and the populations being studied.  This includes information about the genetic linkage of markers, selection, the rate of recombination, the rate of mutation, genetic drift, non-random mating, and population structure.When genetic linkage is suspected (a pair of loci exhibit strong LD across multiple populations) often only the one with the highest allele frequency is retained.  If LD is observed between many pairs of loci within the same population, the population may be dropped since many statistical tests assume equilibrium within populations."

            "In the past, we have estimated salmonid abundances using multiple-pass removal depletion methods. Though multipass-depletion estimates are useful for examining site-specific temporal trends, the large degree of within-year variability among site estimates that has commonly been documented in our surveys does not permit a reliable examination of abundance when estimates are expanded to larger spatial scales (Firehammer et al. 2009). Because of this shortcoming and the desire to increase sampling efficiency, an index of site abundance was preferable to an absolute estimate, and was found to track true abundance over time (Firehammer et al. 2011). Others have also found single-pass indices to perform well in predicting abundances for salmonid populations in small-streams (Jones and Stockwell 1995; Kruse et al. 1998; Bateman et al. 2005). More importantly, we found that depletion estimates underestimated the true abundance, primarily as a result of an overestimation of capture probability during subsequent passes, which was consistent with other studies that documented biases associated with depletion-removal estimates for salmonids in small stream systems (Peterson et al. 2004; Rosenberger and Dunham 2005). Results from trend analyses also indicated that first pass catch data provided similar interpretations of watershed-wide abundance trends in salmonids as did our removal-depletion estimates (Firehammer et al. 2011). These results lend support to using first-pass catch rather than multi-pass depletion estimates to examine long-term reach trajectories in our watersheds."

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream.

            "The RBT is a suite of GIS tools that work within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software. The RBT allows users to describe and measure river channels using high resolution digital elevation models (DEM). The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

            "Standardizing sampling effort, techniques, and gear is critical to allow for comparisons of data among field stations. A suite of environmental measurements are recorded at every site immediately before sampling for fishes. Measurements or observations are taken at the anticipated midpoint of a run (electrofishing, trawling) or at the net location for sampling locations with stationary gear (fyke netting, hoop netting).Water temperature is an essential indicator of freshwater fish health and ecosystem health. Water temperature influences fish metabolic rates, gonad development, fry and fish behavior, and fish embryo development time (Alabaster and Lloyd 2013). Unseasonable (high or low) changes in water temperature can greatly disrupt fish life cycles and health and can result in premature mortality (Alabaster and Lloyd). Thus water temperature isan important measurement for determining the health of the sampling site.Oxygen ispotentially as important as organic substrates derived from food in determining the energy budget for fish. Dissolved oxygen (DO) availability likely affects the ecology of fishesthrough the availability of energy for locomotion, growth, and reproduction (Kramer 1987). Diminished DO concentrations, which can occur with increasing temperatures, can cause behavioral changes in fish, habitat selection changes, and mortality (Kramer 1987; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013).Specific conductance is also an important indicator of ecosystem health. Specific conductance can be a useful indicator of macroinvertebratediversity and richness (Walters et al. 2009; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013), and elevated conductivity has beenlinked to increased urbanization and altered macroinvertebrate assemblages (Walters et al. 2009). Because macroinvertebratesare a common food source of many fish species, it is no surprise that macroinvertebrate densities and fish densities are often positively correlated (Walters et al. 2009).Food webs are inherently dependent on the health of the ecosystem. Water quality measurements like temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygenhelp identify ecosystem health and thus provideessential data for long term resource monitoring and specifically fish monitoring."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

Hydroacoustics can sample the entire water column quickly, and detailed maps of fish densities and mean sizes can be obtained over large bodies of water. As more area is encompassed by a sample, many of the sampling problems created by the spatial patchiness of fish distribution are alleviated. Thus, there tends to be less variation in density estimates across acoustic transects compared to purse-seine hauls or other gear types. Also, the frequency band used in scientific sonars (typically 38 to 200 kHz) is not detectable by most fishes (except see Mann et al. 2001; Gregory and Clabburn 2003). There remain limitations in the type of data that can be collected using hydroacoustics. Currently, single frequency hydroacoustics cannot identify the target species, though broadband and multifrequency sonar systems are showing promise in discerning species in low-diversity systems (Fernandes et al. 2003). Side-looking mobile hydroacoustics cannot discern modes in lengthfrequency distributions unless large differences in length classes exist. When these limitations are recognized, hydroacoustic sampling efforts are cost effective, as estimates from creel surveys are expensive and labor intensive, and the estimates developed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU) measures are not necessarily directly proportional to fish density (Hubert 1996:158159; Yule 2000). When used in concert with purse seining or other active sampling gears, hydroacoustics can provide a comprehensive survey method capable of providing valuable information on target size, population densities, and spatial distribution. Additional aspects of the strengths and limitations of acoustic surveys can be found in MacLennan and Simmonds (1992) and Brandt (1996)."

            "This methodshould be used to determine whether the designed fish passage criteria are met post-construction such that fish passage remains possible. The purpose is to determine whether an engineered solution to a fish passage problem remains viable for at least five years. Natural stream channels provide the benchmark for the passage of all fish for the various life stages at which they migrate. The further a crossing structure (e.g., dam, culvert) departs from the prevailing natural condition, the more impaired fish passage typically becomes. The degree to which the completed passage structure complies with design criteria could measure effectiveness.New stream crossing structures and restoration of fish passage at identified fish passage barriers should utilize design criteria provided through WDFW in the Water Crossing Design Guidelines (Barnard et al. 2013). The methodology in this section will encompass the data necessary to complete evaluations of fish passage structures found inFish Passage Barrier and Surface Water Diversion Screen Assessment and Prioritization(WDFW 2009). These guidelines are based on best available science related to fish passage. In addition to those criteria, the gradient of the fish passage structure will be measured and compared to the original design criteria. Deviations of greater than 20% shall be considered out of compliance.Projects designed and constructed to criteria in the above-referenced guidance documents are presumed to provide fish passage. Therefore, monitoring of project design upon completion of construction and over time constitutes the most appropriate and measurable effectiveness monitoring. Additionally, to assess whether partial fish passage barriers have been improved, it is necessary to evaluate adult and juvenile fish densities to determine whether increased fish utilization has been accomplished."

Growth can provide information on health, population dynamics, and habitat quality (Quist et al. 2012). The method described here relies on direct observation of individuals and entails capturing, marking (using VI, PIT, or other tags with unique identifiers), and recapturing at regular intervals to obtain length and weight data. Because of this, the method is the least variable and most accurate for determining growth as measurement error is the only source of possible variation.

            "This method is derived from an Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) protocol developed for monitoring western wadable streams. Included in this method are instructions for measuring stream substrate size and embeddedness at cross sectional transects. In addition wetted width, water depth and other physical dimensions are also recorded.Substrate Size and Channel Dimensions:Substrate size is one of the most important determinants of habitat character for fish and macroinvertebrates in streams. Here, we use the term substrate size to describe the size of streambed surface particles Along with bedform (e.g., riffles and pools), substrate influences the hydraulic roughness and consequently the range of water velocities in the channel. It also influences the size range of interstices that provide living space and cover for macroinvertebrates, salamanders, and sculpins. Substrate characteristics are often sensitive indicators of the effects of human activities on streams. Decreases in the mean substrate size and increases in the percentage of fine sediments, for example, may destabilize channels and indicate changes in the rates of upland erosion and sediment supply (Dietrich et al. 1989, Wilcock 1998).In the EMAP protocol, substrate size and embeddedness are evaluated at each of the 11 cross-section transects (refer to Figure 7-1) using a combination of methods adapted from those described by Wolman (1954), Bain et al. (1985), Platts et al. (1983), and Plafkin et al. (1989). Substrate size is also evaluated at 10 additional cross-sections located midway between each of the 11 regular transects (A-K). The basis of the protocol is a systematic selection of 5 substrate particles from each of 21 cross-section transects (Figure 7-6). In the process of measuring substrate particle sizes at each channel cross section, the wetted width of the channel and the water depth at each substrate sample point are measured (at the 10 midway cross-sections, only substrate size and wetted width are recorded). If the wetted channel is split by a mid-channel bar (see Section 7.4.1), the five substrate points are centered between the wetted width boundaries regardless of the mid-channel bar in between. Consequently, substrate particles selected in some cross sections may be high and dry. For cross-sections that are entirely dry, make measurements across the unvegetated portion of the channel. The distance you record to the right bank is the same as the wetted channel width. The substrate sampling points along the cross-section are located at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of the measured wetted width, with the first and last points located at the water's edge just within the left and right banks."

In response to predation concerns, actions were taken to evaluate predator reduction strategies and eventually an aggressive predator removal program was implemented in 2006 aimed at collapsing the lake trout population and temporarily reducing the rainbow trout population. A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used.Netting cannot be used to effectively capture rainbow trout, so the AIP is essentially the sole method to reduce rainbow trout predation on kokanee. Additionally, population modeling suggested angling was a critical component needed to effectively collapse the lake trout population (Hansen et al. 2010)."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Relative growth is simply growth as a percent of fish length or weight at initial tagging (Lugert et al. 2016), and is useful because fish of the same cohort vary in size even in the same location. For instance, two age-0 steelhead might be tagged at a location, one might be 55 mm Fork Length (FL), the other might be 60 mm FL. Both fish might be recatpured two months later having both grown by 2 mm. Thoughchange in length was the same (2 mm), the 55 mm fish grew more relative to it's initial length.

We propose to take advantage of a new hierarchal Bayesian modeling approach to estimate predator abundance in the Columbia River between Priest Rapids and McNary dams (Korman et al. 2016). Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

Typically, trap nets are biased towards capturing larger, more active fish. One benefit to trap nets is they have essentially zero mortality, with the rare exception of a small fish that becomes stuck in the trap mesh. Therefore, trap nets are effective for capturing fish to be used for other purposes (e.g., telemetry, population estimates), and the nets are easily standardized for catch rate trend analyses. Large versions of trap nets have been used in commercial fisheries in the Great Lakes for many years. More details on the use of trap nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes.

Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream.

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993). Additional insights into use of gill nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

The CRITFC lab also developed and tested hundreds of additional SNP loci specifically for projects involving Genetic Stock Identification (GSI), Parentage Based Tagging, intraspecific hybridization/introgression, reproductive success, and selection studies (Campbell et al 2008).  Currently, there are 192 SNP markers (two 96 panel sets) for both steelhead and Chinook salmon that have been selected for use by CRITFC and IDFG for BPA projects involving GSI and PBT in the Columbia River basin.  For PBT broodstock tagging in the Snake River basin, one 96 SNP panel for each species has been optimized to provide sufficient power for parentage tagging (Steele et al 2011).  For GSI, both the 96 PBT SNP panel and a second 96 SNP panel are run for GSI projects. Procedures for running SNPs on the Fluidigm EP1 SNP Genotyping platform are described in method 1332.

Progeny from any of these parents (either collected as juveniles or returning adults), if genotyped, could be assigned back to their parents, thus identifying the hatchery they originated from and exact brood year they were produced in (Anderson and Garza 2005; Steele et al 2011). Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

Gill nets are one of the most commonly used gears to collect fish and can be used in a variety of different ways including floating, sinking, suspended, vertical, set, or drifted. Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

It is most effective when used in relatively shallow water with few obstructions, where fish are in high concentrations, and for species that are less likely to outswim the net; however, in some circumstances seining can capture highly mobile species such as adult salmon. Seining permits the sampling of relatively large areas in short periods of time as well as the capture and release of fish without significant stress or harm, as long as the bunt of the seine is kept in water and the fish are not too crowded (or fish are quickly moved to a holding container). Cost of gear, boats, and personnel range from relatively inexpensive to modest, depending on the scope and frequency of sampling.Seining may be carried out in a variety of habitat types, depending on the population and life stage of the targeted species. Sites with irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, or dense stands of aquatic vegetation may not be suitable for seining due to net snagging or lifting and reduced fish retention. Current velocity and depth influence site selection and choice of net design. Seines vary in size and design. To help understand what affects selectivity and capture efficiencyand therefore, effectiveness of seiningwe considered the following categories: habitat, water, fish, time of year and day, net, and method. Considering these factors in your study design before you sample and after you begin sampling (by underwater observation and calibration studies) will help you to decide when seining may be a good technique to meet your objectives; it will also help improve the analysis of data collected.Perpendicular set beach seining may be used for fish/area or fish/volume analysis (length, width, and depth must be measured), but fish/set is appropriate only if the distance pulled is consistent. The poles may be marked with 0.1-m-depth increments to facilitate measuring the water depth at the offshore end of the seine (note: take an average of two or more depths). To ensure consistent width of swept area, a rope of known length can be attached to the upper end of each pole (DE in Figure 1) and stretched tight during seining."

            "Measuring the lengths of macroinvertebrates is often necessary to later calculating length-frequency histograms, developing length-weight regressions, and estimating biomass from length-weight regressions. The length measurement of choice will depend on the species of interest. For example, a larval mayfly might have its total length measured whereas a crayfish might just have its carapace length measured. The number of individuals measured will also depend on the final use of the data and the amount of length variability in the population. For example, a sample size of 100 individuals might be adequate for generating a length-weight regression, but a sample size of 500 individuals might be more appropriate for discerning the age structure of a population for which many length bins are used. This describes a general method for measuring the length of an invertebrate and should be customized based on the species of interest."

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

And fish handling may be restricted through regulation when threatened or endangered species are present. When this occurs, timed sub-samples are taken and the total number of fish can be estimated.Due to the non-homogeneous behavior of juvenile salmonids during passage through fish screening facilities, sampling should occur 24 hours per day and 7 days per week. And sub-samples taken, at minimum, once per hour. When sampling cannot occur (e.g. mechanical failure, heavy debris, high-density of non-target fish), additional extrapolation is required. Catch during an unsampled period can be estimated by interpolating catch from the previous and following sampling periods or by any temporal (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) or diel (e.g., day and night) stratification that minimizes the variance of the estimates, while still having biological/environmental relevance."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

An opercle punch was chosen as an appropriate mark in our studies whereby we were estimating abundance of spring spawning salmonids. During the spring, water temperatures are cold enough so that the hole created by the punch would not heal over quickly during the time period prior to recapture (i.e., 2-4 weeks). Thus, the mark would not be lost and it would be recognizable upon recapture. Furthermore, the tool used to create the punch was small so that it was not an intrusive procedure for the fish and the hole it created was not unusually large for the size of trout marked. Therefore, we felt it would not unduly affect the behavior or survivability of the fish."

We propose to take advantage of a new hierarchal Bayesian modeling approach to estimate predator abundance in the Columbia River between Priest Rapids and McNary dams (Korman et al. 2016). Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993). Additional insights into use of gill nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Progeny from any of these parents (either collected as juveniles or returning adults), if genotyped, could be assigned back to their parents, thus identifying the hatchery they originated from and exact brood year they were produced in (Anderson and Garza 2005; Steele et al 2011). Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

Snorkelers approach each object andestimate its size. Live fishof known size can also be used. One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size. Another method is to capture fish of severalsize classes and place them in temporary live cages(Rich 1993). Snorkelers independently view each fishand report their results to an instructor."

We propose to take advantage of a new hierarchal Bayesian modeling approach to estimate predator abundance in the Columbia River between Priest Rapids and McNary dams (Korman et al. 2016). Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled). A more detailed description of the field methods, model structure and assumptions is provide below."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

Gill nets are one of the most commonly used gears to collect fish and can be used in a variety of different ways including floating, sinking, suspended, vertical, set, or drifted. Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes. Similarly, a different approach would be to replicate the methods and equipment used by these companies."

One benefit to trap nets is they have essentially zero mortality, with the rare exception of a small fish that becomes stuck in the trap mesh. Therefore, trap nets are effective for capturing fish to be used for other purposes (e.g., telemetry, population estimates), and the nets are easily standardized for catch rate trend analyses. Large versions of trap nets have been used in commercial fisheries in the Great Lakes for many years. More details on the use of trap nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks.

More simply, DFAis useful for determining whether a set of variables is effective in predicting category membership. Discriminant function analysis is the preferred and most commonly used multivariate assignment techniquewhen dealing with isotopic ratio data with the intent of assigning fish to an origin location (Nowling et al. 2011; Gahagan et al. 2012). Discriminant function analysis maintains the following assumptions that should be considered, although this technique is typically robust to slight violations of these assumptions.1) multivariate normality2) homoscedasticity3) non-multicollinearity4) independenceThe following text was paraphrased from Poulsen and French (http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/discrim/discrim.pdf)Discriminant function analysis can be broken into two steps. The first step is testing the significance of a set of discriminant functions. The second step is classification.In the first step there is a matrix of total variances and covariances, and there is also a matrix of pooled within-group variances and covariances. The two matrices are compared via multivariate F tests in order to determine whether or not there are any significant differences (with regard to all variables) between groups. The multivariate test is performed first to determine which of the variables have significantly different means across the groups. Once group means are found to be statistically significant, classification of variables is undertaken. Discriminant function analysis automatically determines some optimal combination of variables so that the first function provides the most overall discrimination between groups, the second provides second most, and so on. Moreover, the functions will be independent or orthogonal, that is, their contributions to the discrimination between groups will not overlap. The first function picks up the most variation; the second function picks up the greatest part of the unexplained variation, etc. Computationally, a canonical correlation analysis is performed that will determine the successive functions and canonical roots. Classification is then possible from the canonical functions. Subjects are classified in the groups in which they had the highest classification scores. The maximum number of discriminant functions will be equal to the degrees of freedom, or the number of variables in the analysis, whichever is smaller."

This provides insight into the relative magnitude of measurement noise, year-year variation, watershed-watershed variation, stratum-stratum variation, and site-site variation within each stratum / watershed combination."

Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4.

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

Because of the abundant heterogeneity of habitat types encountered in an aquatic system, the initial data collection effort for this parameter is labor intensive. Field practitioners must physically walk each reach, using a GPS to geo-reference each habitat type, and afterwards post-process the GPS data to create a map of the reach.All months are rated the same for this attribute, although it is recognized that the relative amount of this habitat type can change over a wide range of flow levels. When rating this attribute, a moderate flow level should be assumed. Habitat types are entered as a point estimate of the percentage of the stream reach wetted width for the particular habitat type.Backwater PoolPercentage of the wetted channel surface area comprising backwater pools. Backwater pools are habitat units located along the channel margins but are otherwise enclosed  though still connected to the main channel (or side channel). Note: backwater pools as defined here include alcoves as described by Nickleson et al. (1992).Beaver PondPercentage of the wetted channel surface area comprising beaver ponds (in the presence of a beaver dam). Note: these are pools located in the main or side channels, not part of off-channel habitat.GlidePercentage of the wetted channel surface area comprising glides, a habitat type that is intermediate between pool and riffle. The definition applied here is from the ODFW habitat survey manual (Moore et al. 1999): an area with generally uniform depth and flow with no surface turbulence, generally in reaches of <1% gradient. Glides may have some small scour areas but are distinguished from pools by their overall homogeneity and lack of structure. They are generally deeper than riffles with few major flow obstructions and low habitat complexity.Large Cobble/Boulder RifflePercentage of the wetted channel surface area comprising large cobble/boulder riffles. Particle sizes of substrate modified from Platts et al. (1983): gravel (0.2 to 2.9 inch diameter), small cobble (2.9 to 5 inch diameter), large cobble (5 to 11.9 inch diameter), boulder (>11.9 inch diameter). Cascades are included in this habitat type for the purposes of the EDT analysis.Pool TailoutsPercentage of the wetted channel surface area comprising pool tailouts. Pool-tailouts are a primary spawning habitat for nearly all salmonids.Primary PoolPercentage of the wetted channel surface area comprising pools, excluding beaver ponds. Pools serve as key habitat for some life stages of virtually all salmonids.Small Cobble/Gravel RifflePercentage of the wetted channel surface area comprising small cobble/gravel riffles. Particle sizes of substrate modified from Platts et al.

Off-channel habitat consists of oxbows, back swamps, riverine ponds, and the channels that connect them to the main channel or its side channels.Off-channel habitat is not a percent, rather, it is a multiplier used to estimate the amount of off-channel habitat based on the wetted surface area of the all combined in-channel habitat. To calculate the off-channel habitat factor, divide the total length of off-channel habitat by the total length of the reach."

The following criteria should be used when considering sections of channel for delineation as unique channel units: 1. In general, channel units are at least as long as the wetted channel width. 2. Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4. Falls, steps, and plunge pools are rarely as long as the wetted channel width, but should be delineated as separate channel units due to their importance as fish habitat and areas of topographic complexity."

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993). Additional insights into use of gill nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

As researchers and managers, we are obliged to handle the fish we are sampling responsibly (Nickum et al. 2004). This is an important topic that should be considered by all practitioners sampling fish. Detailed fish handing guidelines are available from Nickum et al. 2004, the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) 2005, and Stickney (1983). When markrecapture sampling, it is critical that handled and marked fish return to normal activities before the recapture sample begins to help satisfy the equal catchability assumption associated with markrecapture estimators. There are several examples of things we can do to reduce the handling stress of sampled fish. For instance, minimize sampling at water temperatures above 18 degrees Celsius, use live well colors that mimic the natural environment and included cover, avoid overcrowding fish in live wells, and segregate large predatory fish from small fish to prevent predation in the live well. Also, the zone 0.5 m from an electrofishing anode has been termed the potential zone of injury; thus fish in close proximity to the anode should be quickly removed from it while electrofishing (NMFS 2000). After removal from the water, captured fish should be held for the shortest time possible in live wells with recirculated or aerated water that has approximately the same temperature as the ambient water temperature they were removed from. An innovative live well design used for holding captured stream fish was proposed by Isaak and Hubert (1997) for stream sampling and by Sharber and Carothers (1987) for boat or raft units. Perhaps the most important consideration is to minimize handling of fish during any research or sampling activity."

Discharge measurements are important for assessing trends in streamwater acidity and other characteristics that are very sensitive to streamflow differences.  Stream discharge information is also useful in interpreting the representativeness of water chemistry data and some physical habitat information.  The response design for stream discharge involves a single determination at suitable location within the support reach to characterize conditions at the sampling point.  The location selected should be as close as possible to the location where chemical samples are collected, so that these data correspond.  No single method for measuring discharge is applicable to all types of stream channels.  The preferred procedure is based on velocity-area methods, and provides either the measurement data to calculate discharge or the calculated value for stream discharge.  For streams too small or too shallow there are 2 other methods: neutrally bouyant velocity procedure and  timed filling procedure."

            "This methodshould be used to determine whether the designed fish passage criteria are met post-construction such that fish passage remains possible. The purpose is to determine whether an engineered solution to a fish passage problem remains viable for at least five years. Natural stream channels provide the benchmark for the passage of all fish for the various life stages at which they migrate. The further a crossing structure (e.g., dam, culvert) departs from the prevailing natural condition, the more impaired fish passage typically becomes. The degree to which the completed passage structure complies with design criteria could measure effectiveness.New stream crossing structures and restoration of fish passage at identified fish passage barriers should utilize design criteria provided through WDFW in the Water Crossing Design Guidelines (Barnard et al. 2013). The methodology in this section will encompass the data necessary to complete evaluations of fish passage structures found inFish Passage Barrier and Surface Water Diversion Screen Assessment and Prioritization(WDFW 2009). These guidelines are based on best available science related to fish passage. In addition to those criteria, the gradient of the fish passage structure will be measured and compared to the original design criteria. Deviations of greater than 20% shall be considered out of compliance.Projects designed and constructed to criteria in the above-referenced guidance documents are presumed to provide fish passage. Therefore, monitoring of project design upon completion of construction and over time constitutes the most appropriate and measurable effectiveness monitoring. Additionally, to assess whether partial fish passage barriers have been improved, it is necessary to evaluate adult and juvenile fish densities to determine whether increased fish utilization has been accomplished."

For instance, spawning or dead salmon often have eroded tails (from redd excavation) or enlarged or damaged jaws.  When researchers want to compare fish lengths of male spawners versus female spawners or hatchery spawned females versus carcasses, it is a good idea to use this type of length measurement to remove the bias of the eroded tails on female spawners.  So length measurements are made from specific parts of the body that are intact, such as the orbit and the hypural plate. The hypural plate is comprised of modified vertebrae that support the rays of the caudal fin and originate from the posterior end of the vertebral column (Figure 1)."

Fish to be tagged may or may not be anesthetized first, and will depend on the species and how quickly they can be handled during the tagging process.Anchor tags are composed of a T-shaped (T-bar) or barbed (dart) attachment end that is embedded in the fish. The other end is a colored plastic tube or streamer that typically has information about the project printed on it (Zale et al. 2012).

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).

Each increment gives a subtotal of the stream discharge, and the whole is calculated as the sum of these parts. Discharge measurements are made at only one carefully chosen channel cross-section. It is important to choose a channel cross-section that is as much like a canal as possible. A glide area with a U-shaped channel cross-section that is free of obstructions provides the best conditions for measuring discharge. You may remove rocks and other obstructions to improve the cross-section before any measurements are made."

            "A model for salmon population dynamics has been coded in the R programming language. This model provides an analytical framework for habitat action effectiveness monitoring. The model implements the Beverton-Holt spawner-recruit salmon population dynamics model (Beverton and Holt 1957). Inputs describing one or more areas within a watershed, survival estimates by life stage, etc., are user specified, as are measures of uncertainty in parameter estimates, and estimates of spatial, temporal, and pure variability of input parameters. Initial salmonid populations, by life stage, are also user specified. The model calculates fish populations by life stage over for each subsequent year up to a user specified number of years. Hatchery fish introductions into a watershed, and parameters describing the relative robustness and fecundity of hatchery fish and their descendants, can also be user specified.Included in the model is the option for user specified levels of stochasticity, applied at various levels. This stochasticity serves two functions: 1) estimation of uncertainty of model results stemming fromuncertaintyof input parameters; and 2) estimation of temporal, spatial, and pure variability in the results stemming from temporal, spatial, and pure variability in the input parameters. Stochasticity at all levels is user specified, and structured so as to give rise to natural correlations among input parameters. These correlation structures enable a stochastic model much more reflective of natural processes than could be achieved by assuming independence across all parameters.Also included in the model is the ability to include time based trends and/or step function changes for all user specified parameters. Such changes may reflect, for example, changes in watershed management that lead to gradual increases in forested lands within a watershed, or discrete changes, such as a change in dam management, leading to a step function shift in seasonal water flows.Multiple sites may be modeled simultaneously. Sites, in this model, refer to a user-defined spatial scale over which the user wishes to define the input parameters. A site may be a reach within a tributary, a tributary within a watershed, a watershed within a subbasin, etc. The advantages of concurrent modeling of multiple sites, as opposed to modeling one site at a time, are two-fold: First, sites within a watershed are likely not independent; a low water year for a single site is likely a low water year for all sites within a watershed; this model can account for such correlations. Secondly, modeling multiple sites concurrently allows for inclusion of cross-site migration, where fish at various life stages have some user specified non-zero probability of migrating to a different site within a watershed. In addition, modeling multiple sites concurrently allows summarization of results at various spatial levels upon completion of the simulation (i.e. results may be summarized by site, stream, river, watershed, etc).The model has been structured such that it is flexible enough to handle different species of salmonids (though they cannot be modeled simultaneously). This includes steelhead, which have life cycles that are generally more complex than other salmonid species."

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

Tagging of Steelhead parr at age-0 or age-1 with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags and subsequent recaptures of those fish allows individual identification of fish and calculation of growth sesonally or annually. Relative growth is simply growth as a percent of fish length or weight at initial tagging (Lugert et al. 2016), and is useful because fish of the same cohort vary in size even in the same location. For instance, two age-0 steelhead might be tagged at a location, one might be 55 mm Fork Length (FL), the other might be 60 mm FL. Both fish might be recatpured two months later having both grown by 2 mm. Thoughchange in length was the same (2 mm), the 55 mm fish grew more relative to it's initial length.

Additionally, the substrate composition within and in the vicinities of constructed redds could be measured to evaluate if preferred spawning habitat differs among hatchery and natural-origin fish."

For instance, spawning or dead salmon often have eroded tails (from redd excavation) or enlarged or damaged jaws.  When researchers want to compare fish lengths of male spawners versus female spawners or hatchery spawned females versus carcasses, it is a good idea to use this type of length measurement to remove the bias of the eroded tails on female spawners.  So length measurements are made from specific parts of the body that are intact, such as the orbit and the hypural plate. The hypural plate is comprised of modified vertebrae that support the rays of the caudal fin and originate from the posterior end of the vertebral column (Figure 1)."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

            "This method is derived from an Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) protocol developed for monitoring western wadable streams. Included in this method are instructions for measuring stream substrate size and embeddedness at cross sectional transects. In addition wetted width, water depth and other physical dimensions are also recorded.Substrate Size and Channel Dimensions:Substrate size is one of the most important determinants of habitat character for fish and macroinvertebrates in streams. Here, we use the term substrate size to describe the size of streambed surface particles Along with bedform (e.g., riffles and pools), substrate influences the hydraulic roughness and consequently the range of water velocities in the channel. It also influences the size range of interstices that provide living space and cover for macroinvertebrates, salamanders, and sculpins. Substrate characteristics are often sensitive indicators of the effects of human activities on streams. Decreases in the mean substrate size and increases in the percentage of fine sediments, for example, may destabilize channels and indicate changes in the rates of upland erosion and sediment supply (Dietrich et al. 1989, Wilcock 1998).In the EMAP protocol, substrate size and embeddedness are evaluated at each of the 11 cross-section transects (refer to Figure 7-1) using a combination of methods adapted from those described by Wolman (1954), Bain et al. (1985), Platts et al. (1983), and Plafkin et al. (1989). Substrate size is also evaluated at 10 additional cross-sections located midway between each of the 11 regular transects (A-K). The basis of the protocol is a systematic selection of 5 substrate particles from each of 21 cross-section transects (Figure 7-6). In the process of measuring substrate particle sizes at each channel cross section, the wetted width of the channel and the water depth at each substrate sample point are measured (at the 10 midway cross-sections, only substrate size and wetted width are recorded). If the wetted channel is split by a mid-channel bar (see Section 7.4.1), the five substrate points are centered between the wetted width boundaries regardless of the mid-channel bar in between. Consequently, substrate particles selected in some cross sections may be high and dry. For cross-sections that are entirely dry, make measurements across the unvegetated portion of the channel. The distance you record to the right bank is the same as the wetted channel width. The substrate sampling points along the cross-section are located at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of the measured wetted width, with the first and last points located at the water's edge just within the left and right banks."

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

Most preservation techniques focus on eliminating water from the sample through chemical or physical drying. This is done since most of the harmful enzymes that degrade DNA require an aqueous environment to function. One of the most common methods for dessication involves storing the sample in ethanol. However, purchasing non-denatured ethanol is usually expensive and requires permits. In addition, shipping ethanol preserved samples requires special packaging and declaration. Finally, ethanol preserved samples need to be checked for evaporation and for dilution, and are best stored in a refrigerator or freezer. An alternative to chemical dessication are dry preservation techniques (Lahood et al 2008). The outline below describes a method for sampling and storing fish tissue on cellulose-based filter paper. This method is simple, rapid and cost-effective, and can be effectively employed for large-scale genetic sampling efforts as part of Parentage Based Tagging and Genetic Stock Identification programs.http://youtu.be/QcZVo6Zz6Cg"

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993).

More simply, DFAis useful for determining whether a set of variables is effective in predicting category membership. Discriminant function analysis is the preferred and most commonly used multivariate assignment techniquewhen dealing with isotopic ratio data with the intent of assigning fish to an origin location (Nowling et al. 2011; Gahagan et al. 2012). Discriminant function analysis maintains the following assumptions that should be considered, although this technique is typically robust to slight violations of these assumptions.1) multivariate normality2) homoscedasticity3) non-multicollinearity4) independenceThe following text was paraphrased from Poulsen and French (http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/discrim/discrim.pdf)Discriminant function analysis can be broken into two steps. The first step is testing the significance of a set of discriminant functions. The second step is classification.In the first step there is a matrix of total variances and covariances, and there is also a matrix of pooled within-group variances and covariances. The two matrices are compared via multivariate F tests in order to determine whether or not there are any significant differences (with regard to all variables) between groups. The multivariate test is performed first to determine which of the variables have significantly different means across the groups. Once group means are found to be statistically significant, classification of variables is undertaken. Discriminant function analysis automatically determines some optimal combination of variables so that the first function provides the most overall discrimination between groups, the second provides second most, and so on. Moreover, the functions will be independent or orthogonal, that is, their contributions to the discrimination between groups will not overlap. The first function picks up the most variation; the second function picks up the greatest part of the unexplained variation, etc. Computationally, a canonical correlation analysis is performed that will determine the successive functions and canonical roots. Classification is then possible from the canonical functions. Subjects are classified in the groups in which they had the highest classification scores. The maximum number of discriminant functions will be equal to the degrees of freedom, or the number of variables in the analysis, whichever is smaller."

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes.

When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

Gill nets are one of the most commonly used gears to collect fish and can be used in a variety of different ways including floating, sinking, suspended, vertical, set, or drifted. Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used. Gill netting for mature lake trout can be especially productive during the spawning period.

            "In the past, we have estimated salmonid abundances using multiple-pass removal depletion methods. Though multipass-depletion estimates are useful for examining site-specific temporal trends, the large degree of within-year variability among site estimates that has commonly been documented in our surveys does not permit a reliable examination of abundance when estimates are expanded to larger spatial scales (Firehammer et al. 2009). Because of this shortcoming and the desire to increase sampling efficiency, an index of site abundance was preferable to an absolute estimate, and was found to track true abundance over time (Firehammer et al. 2011). Others have also found single-pass indices to perform well in predicting abundances for salmonid populations in small-streams (Jones and Stockwell 1995; Kruse et al. 1998; Bateman et al. 2005). More importantly, we found that depletion estimates underestimated the true abundance, primarily as a result of an overestimation of capture probability during subsequent passes, which was consistent with other studies that documented biases associated with depletion-removal estimates for salmonids in small stream systems (Peterson et al. 2004; Rosenberger and Dunham 2005). Results from trend analyses also indicated that first pass catch data provided similar interpretations of watershed-wide abundance trends in salmonids as did our removal-depletion estimates (Firehammer et al. 2011). These results lend support to using first-pass catch rather than multi-pass depletion estimates to examine long-term reach trajectories in our watersheds."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

            "This methodshould be used to determine whether the designed fish passage criteria are met post-construction such that fish passage remains possible. The purpose is to determine whether an engineered solution to a fish passage problem remains viable for at least five years. Natural stream channels provide the benchmark for the passage of all fish for the various life stages at which they migrate. The further a crossing structure (e.g., dam, culvert) departs from the prevailing natural condition, the more impaired fish passage typically becomes. The degree to which the completed passage structure complies with design criteria could measure effectiveness.New stream crossing structures and restoration of fish passage at identified fish passage barriers should utilize design criteria provided through WDFW in the Water Crossing Design Guidelines (Barnard et al. 2013). The methodology in this section will encompass the data necessary to complete evaluations of fish passage structures found inFish Passage Barrier and Surface Water Diversion Screen Assessment and Prioritization(WDFW 2009). These guidelines are based on best available science related to fish passage. In addition to those criteria, the gradient of the fish passage structure will be measured and compared to the original design criteria. Deviations of greater than 20% shall be considered out of compliance.Projects designed and constructed to criteria in the above-referenced guidance documents are presumed to provide fish passage. Therefore, monitoring of project design upon completion of construction and over time constitutes the most appropriate and measurable effectiveness monitoring. Additionally, to assess whether partial fish passage barriers have been improved, it is necessary to evaluate adult and juvenile fish densities to determine whether increased fish utilization has been accomplished."

            "Snorkeling is the underwater observation and study of fish in flowing waters. Snorkel surveys can be used with other techniques to estimate abundance using markrecapture techniques. The use of snorkel surveys for markrecapture estimates provides a calibration factor for the counting efficiency of snorkel surveys as compared to other methods such as electrofishing and seining. For this technique to be used, the system should be closed off with block nets so that the total population observed is constant. For markrecapture estimates, fish need to be collected, marked, and released back to the sample area. Collection occurs with electrofishing, seining, or trapping; marking is done using tags or dyes with color coding or patterns; and release is into the sample reach. Snorkel surveys can then be conducted in the same sample reach to count the number of marked fish. The ratio of the number of fish resighted (i.e., those with marks that are counted) can be used as a calibration factor for the effectiveness of a snorkel survey compared to other survey methods. Fish can be marked differently based on size-class and species recorded by observers, which can help identify those species and size-classes that may have been undercounted using a snorkel survey approach."

Finding a good rock is the most important step to a successful sensor installation. The best rocks are large enough that they often protrude a foot or more above the low flow water surface and wide enough that they can effectively shield the sensor from moving rocks or debris during floods. Ideal site characteristics downstream of large rocks are pockets of relatively calm water with smaller substrate sizes. If large rocks and cobbles are on the downstream side, similarly large substrates are likely to move there again during the next flood and could dislodge the sensor. Finally, the rock should provide a relatively flat downstream attachment surface that is deep enough to remain submerged and in or near flowing water for the entire year. Large substrates suitable for attachment may be relatively rare within low-gradient, meadow reaches, and in these instances, seek steeper channels immediately up or downstream of the meadow. Immobile structures like bridge footings may be considered but we do not recommend attachment to large logs, as they may decay over time."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

The thalweg profile is a longitudinal survey of maximum flow path depth and several other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points (termed stations) along the length of the support reach measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from the thalweg profile allows calculation of indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools. This habitat assessment modifies traditional methods by measuring upstream distance in the middle of the channel, rather than along the thalweg itself (though each thalweg depth measurement is taken at the point of the deepest flow path at each station).Overview: method activities/data collected1.

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

In response to predation concerns, actions were taken to evaluate predator reduction strategies and eventually an aggressive predator removal program was implemented in 2006 aimed at collapsing the lake trout population and temporarily reducing the rainbow trout population. A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used.Netting cannot be used to effectively capture rainbow trout, so the AIP is essentially the sole method to reduce rainbow trout predation on kokanee. Additionally, population modeling suggested angling was a critical component needed to effectively collapse the lake trout population (Hansen et al. 2010)."

This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.

We propose to take advantage of a new hierarchal Bayesian modeling approach to estimate predator abundance in the Columbia River between Priest Rapids and McNary dams (Korman et al. 2016). Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata.

Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4.

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

Gill nets are one of the most commonly used gears to collect fish and can be used in a variety of different ways including floating, sinking, suspended, vertical, set, or drifted. Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used. Gill netting for mature lake trout can be especially productive during the spawning period.

More simply, DFAis useful for determining whether a set of variables is effective in predicting category membership. Discriminant function analysis is the preferred and most commonly used multivariate assignment techniquewhen dealing with isotopic ratio data with the intent of assigning fish to an origin location (Nowling et al. 2011; Gahagan et al. 2012). Discriminant function analysis maintains the following assumptions that should be considered, although this technique is typically robust to slight violations of these assumptions.1) multivariate normality2) homoscedasticity3) non-multicollinearity4) independenceThe following text was paraphrased from Poulsen and French (http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/discrim/discrim.pdf)Discriminant function analysis can be broken into two steps. The first step is testing the significance of a set of discriminant functions. The second step is classification.In the first step there is a matrix of total variances and covariances, and there is also a matrix of pooled within-group variances and covariances. The two matrices are compared via multivariate F tests in order to determine whether or not there are any significant differences (with regard to all variables) between groups. The multivariate test is performed first to determine which of the variables have significantly different means across the groups. Once group means are found to be statistically significant, classification of variables is undertaken. Discriminant function analysis automatically determines some optimal combination of variables so that the first function provides the most overall discrimination between groups, the second provides second most, and so on. Moreover, the functions will be independent or orthogonal, that is, their contributions to the discrimination between groups will not overlap. The first function picks up the most variation; the second function picks up the greatest part of the unexplained variation, etc. Computationally, a canonical correlation analysis is performed that will determine the successive functions and canonical roots. Classification is then possible from the canonical functions. Subjects are classified in the groups in which they had the highest classification scores. The maximum number of discriminant functions will be equal to the degrees of freedom, or the number of variables in the analysis, whichever is smaller."

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

An opercle punch was chosen as an appropriate mark in our studies whereby we were estimating abundance of spring spawning salmonids. During the spring, water temperatures are cold enough so that the hole created by the punch would not heal over quickly during the time period prior to recapture (i.e., 2-4 weeks). Thus, the mark would not be lost and it would be recognizable upon recapture. Furthermore, the tool used to create the punch was small so that it was not an intrusive procedure for the fish and the hole it created was not unusually large for the size of trout marked. Therefore, we felt it would not unduly affect the behavior or survivability of the fish."

Discriminant function analysis is the preferred and most commonly used multivariate assignment techniquewhen dealing with isotopic ratio data with the intent of assigning fish to an origin location (Nowling et al. 2011; Gahagan et al. 2012). Discriminant function analysis maintains the following assumptions that should be considered, although this technique is typically robust to slight violations of these assumptions.1) multivariate normality2) homoscedasticity3) non-multicollinearity4) independenceThe following text was paraphrased from Poulsen and French (http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/discrim/discrim.pdf)Discriminant function analysis can be broken into two steps. The first step is testing the significance of a set of discriminant functions. The second step is classification.In the first step there is a matrix of total variances and covariances, and there is also a matrix of pooled within-group variances and covariances. The two matrices are compared via multivariate F tests in order to determine whether or not there are any significant differences (with regard to all variables) between groups. The multivariate test is performed first to determine which of the variables have significantly different means across the groups. Once group means are found to be statistically significant, classification of variables is undertaken. Discriminant function analysis automatically determines some optimal combination of variables so that the first function provides the most overall discrimination between groups, the second provides second most, and so on. Moreover, the functions will be independent or orthogonal, that is, their contributions to the discrimination between groups will not overlap. The first function picks up the most variation; the second function picks up the greatest part of the unexplained variation, etc. Computationally, a canonical correlation analysis is performed that will determine the successive functions and canonical roots. Classification is then possible from the canonical functions. Subjects are classified in the groups in which they had the highest classification scores. The maximum number of discriminant functions will be equal to the degrees of freedom, or the number of variables in the analysis, whichever is smaller."

Therefore, trap nets are effective for capturing fish to be used for other purposes (e.g., telemetry, population estimates), and the nets are easily standardized for catch rate trend analyses.

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data.

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993).

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

It is most effective when used in relatively shallow water with few obstructions, where fish are in high concentrations, and for species that are less likely to outswim the net; however, in some circumstances seining can capture highly mobile species such as adult salmon. Seining permits the sampling of relatively large areas in short periods of time as well as the capture and release of fish without significant stress or harm, as long as the bunt of the seine is kept in water and the fish are not too crowded (or fish are quickly moved to a holding container). Cost of gear, boats, and personnel range from relatively inexpensive to modest, depending on the scope and frequency of sampling.Seining may be carried out in a variety of habitat types, depending on the population and life stage of the targeted species. Sites with irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, or dense stands of aquatic vegetation may not be suitable for seining due to net snagging or lifting and reduced fish retention. Current velocity and depth influence site selection and choice of net design. Seines vary in size and design. To help understand what affects selectivity and capture efficiencyand therefore, effectiveness of seiningwe considered the following categories: habitat, water, fish, time of year and day, net, and method. Considering these factors in your study design before you sample and after you begin sampling (by underwater observation and calibration studies) will help you to decide when seining may be a good technique to meet your objectives; it will also help improve the analysis of data collected.Perpendicular set beach seining may be used for fish/area or fish/volume analysis (length, width, and depth must be measured), but fish/set is appropriate only if the distance pulled is consistent. The poles may be marked with 0.1-m-depth increments to facilitate measuring the water depth at the offshore end of the seine (note: take an average of two or more depths). To ensure consistent width of swept area, a rope of known length can be attached to the upper end of each pole (DE in Figure 1) and stretched tight during seining."

Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4.

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

In addition, because objectsviewed underwater are magnified about 1.3 times, accurately estimatingthe size of fish underwater requires practice.Snorkelers can practice estimating fish sizes byviewing objects and fish of known sizes underwater.Calibrated wooden dowels or floating cutouts of fishof various sizes can be attached to weights and distributedthroughout a stream channel. Snorkelers approach each object andestimate its size. Live fishof known size can also be used. One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size. Another method is to capture fish of severalsize classes and place them in temporary live cages(Rich 1993). Snorkelers independently view each fishand report their results to an instructor."

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993).

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Gill nets are one of the most commonly used gears to collect fish and can be used in a variety of different ways including floating, sinking, suspended, vertical, set, or drifted. Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

            "Genetic samples, if collected and stored properly, can provide high quality/quantity DNA for many decades, if not hundreds of years. Most preservation techniques focus on eliminating water from the sample through chemical or physical drying. This is done since most of the harmful enzymes that degrade DNA require an aqueous environment to function. One of the most common methods for dessication involves storing the sample in ethanol. However, purchasing non-denatured ethanol is usually expensive and requires permits. In addition, shipping ethanol preserved samples requires special packaging and declaration. Finally, ethanol preserved samples need to be checked for evaporation and for dilution, and are best stored in a refrigerator or freezer. An alternative to chemical dessication are dry preservation techniques (Lahood et al 2008). The outline below describes a method for sampling and storing fish tissue on cellulose-based filter paper. This method is simple, rapid and cost-effective, and can be effectively employed for large-scale genetic sampling efforts as part of Parentage Based Tagging and Genetic Stock Identification programs.http://youtu.be/QcZVo6Zz6Cg"

There are a number of tools and techniques that geneticists use to infer genetic population structure for GSI purposes. Two widely used software programs that use Bayesian clustering methods for this purpose are BAPS  and STRUCTURE.  The methods in these programs operate by creating population clusters in which the assumptions of HardyWeinberg and linkage equilibrium are met, and simultaneously each individual is assigned to a cluster based on probabilistic modeling. BAPS and STRUCTURE each have slightly different underlying assumptions and methodologies."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

This includes information about the genetic linkage of markers, selection, the rate of recombination, the rate of mutation, genetic drift, non-random mating, and population structure.When genetic linkage is suspected (a pair of loci exhibit strong LD across multiple populations) often only the one with the highest allele frequency is retained.  If LD is observed between many pairs of loci within the same population, the population may be dropped since many statistical tests assume equilibrium within populations."

A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used.Netting cannot be used to effectively capture rainbow trout, so the AIP is essentially the sole method to reduce rainbow trout predation on kokanee. Additionally, population modeling suggested angling was a critical component needed to effectively collapse the lake trout population (Hansen et al. 2010)."

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

An opercle punch was chosen as an appropriate mark in our studies whereby we were estimating abundance of spring spawning salmonids. During the spring, water temperatures are cold enough so that the hole created by the punch would not heal over quickly during the time period prior to recapture (i.e., 2-4 weeks). Thus, the mark would not be lost and it would be recognizable upon recapture. Furthermore, the tool used to create the punch was small so that it was not an intrusive procedure for the fish and the hole it created was not unusually large for the size of trout marked. Therefore, we felt it would not unduly affect the behavior or survivability of the fish."

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

            "Boat Electrofishing",
            "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

            "It is often difficult for fisheries researchers and managers to obtain a numeric estimate of a given fish stock fora variety of reasons (e.g., time, funding, logistics, etc.). In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

            "In the past, we have estimated salmonid abundances using multiple-pass removal depletion methods. Though multipass-depletion estimates are useful for examining site-specific temporal trends, the large degree of within-year variability among site estimates that has commonly been documented in our surveys does not permit a reliable examination of abundance when estimates are expanded to larger spatial scales (Firehammer et al. 2009). Because of this shortcoming and the desire to increase sampling efficiency, an index of site abundance was preferable to an absolute estimate, and was found to track true abundance over time (Firehammer et al. 2011). Others have also found single-pass indices to perform well in predicting abundances for salmonid populations in small-streams (Jones and Stockwell 1995; Kruse et al. 1998; Bateman et al. 2005). More importantly, we found that depletion estimates underestimated the true abundance, primarily as a result of an overestimation of capture probability during subsequent passes, which was consistent with other studies that documented biases associated with depletion-removal estimates for salmonids in small stream systems (Peterson et al. 2004; Rosenberger and Dunham 2005). Results from trend analyses also indicated that first pass catch data provided similar interpretations of watershed-wide abundance trends in salmonids as did our removal-depletion estimates (Firehammer et al. 2011). These results lend support to using first-pass catch rather than multi-pass depletion estimates to examine long-term reach trajectories in our watersheds."

A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used.Netting cannot be used to effectively capture rainbow trout, so the AIP is essentially the sole method to reduce rainbow trout predation on kokanee.

Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4. Falls, steps, and plunge pools are rarely as long as the wetted channel width, but should be delineated as separate channel units due to their importance as fish habitat and areas of topographic complexity."

As such, a full understanding of the life history variation displayed in a population is required to understand the risks to the population and how best to manage those risks.Because most salmonids have overlapping generations, much of the variability is reduced, and therefore the population is more resilient.The age at emigration of anadromous salmonids may have implications related to early marine survival, hydrosystem survival, early maturation, and predation among other impacts.

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

An opercle punch was chosen as an appropriate mark in our studies whereby we were estimating abundance of spring spawning salmonids. During the spring, water temperatures are cold enough so that the hole created by the punch would not heal over quickly during the time period prior to recapture (i.e., 2-4 weeks). Thus, the mark would not be lost and it would be recognizable upon recapture. Furthermore, the tool used to create the punch was small so that it was not an intrusive procedure for the fish and the hole it created was not unusually large for the size of trout marked. Therefore, we felt it would not unduly affect the behavior or survivability of the fish."

Predators in the river the size of the Columbia are not uniformly distributed (Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991). A broad stratification of the study area based on general flow characteristics will greatly help reduce variability and increase the precision of abundance estimates. Observed fish densities from different habitat types (e.g., substrate, depth and velocity) will be used to classify all nearshore habitat, which can be effectively sampled using a boat electro-shocker within each strata. Fish densities and capture probabilities will be estimated using mark-recapture for a random sample of habitat types in each strata. Additional sites may be required to reduce the variability in abundance estimates (Korman et al 2016). If required, additional sites will be sampled using a single pass where the number of fish will be adjusted by the respective capture probability for the habitat class. Fish densities for habitat units not sampled in each stratum will be estimate based on their respective area (i.e., proportion not sampled).

As such, a full understanding of the life history variation displayed in a population is required to understand the risks to the population and how best to manage those risks.Because most salmonids have overlapping generations, much of the variability is reduced, and therefore the population is more resilient.The age at emigration of anadromous salmonids may have implications related to early marine survival, hydrosystem survival, early maturation, and predation among other impacts. Understanding the age of emigrating juvenile smolts will allow the researcher to better understand the effects of age on sources of mortality and life history in general."

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water).

Gill nets are one of the most commonly used gears to collect fish and can be used in a variety of different ways including floating, sinking, suspended, vertical, set, or drifted. Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes. Similarly, a different approach would be to replicate the methods and equipment used by these companies."

A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used.Netting cannot be used to effectively capture rainbow trout, so the AIP is essentially the sole method to reduce rainbow trout predation on kokanee. Additionally, population modeling suggested angling was a critical component needed to effectively collapse the lake trout population (Hansen et al. 2010)."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

The relation between CPUE and timing of downstream dispersal for Snake River fall Chinook salmonOncorhynchus tshawytschajuveniles was first described by Connor et al. (2013; Figure 5 inset). It was concluded that timing of downstream dispersal became later as relative abundance along the shorelines increased.

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

The following criteria should be used when considering sections of channel for delineation as unique channel units: 1. In general, channel units are at least as long as the wetted channel width. 2. Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4. Falls, steps, and plunge pools are rarely as long as the wetted channel width, but should be delineated as separate channel units due to their importance as fish habitat and areas of topographic complexity."

            "The number of juvenile salmonids using a juvenile fish screening and bypass facility needs to be determined if estimates of passage and abundance are desired. And fish must be diverted from the screening facility into a trap or evaluation area for enumeration to occur. A number of site-specific designs exist, however, three components are necessary to safely guide fish for sampling and counting. Those components are a dewatering screen, fish separator, and fish holding container.Dewatering screens come in a variety of shapes, sizes, material, and orientation. Incline screens, horizontal screens, and vertical belt screens being the most common. And larger facilities often require multiple dewatering screens. Fish separators grade fish by size and help reduce accumulation of floating debris in holding containers. A single-stage dry separator is frequently used and will have bars spaced according to the species and life stage being monitored. Fish of target size or smaller simply fall through the bar gaps and larger fish pass over the bars, and back into the fish bypass. Fish falling through the separator are collected in a live box or guided into an evaluation area with holding tanks.Complete enumeration of fish is ideal, but often not practical because the number of fish using the facility can exceed holding tank capacities or staffing levels. And fish handling may be restricted through regulation when threatened or endangered species are present. Facilities designed with fish counting in mind, often have the ability to subsample fish. The sample rate is generally based upon the projected number of fish moving through the facility, which is in turn based on the previous days collection, hatchery release schedules, propensity of target species, number of non-target species, and best estimate of changes in passage numbers.Due to the non-homogeneous behavior of juvenile salmonids during passage through fish screening facilities, sampling should occur 24 hours per day and 7 days per week. If sub-sampling, samples should be taken at minimum once per hour. Daily collection goals should be formulated based on project objectives and study design. And the general principle of sampling the fewest number of fish as possibly to answer the questions being investigated should be applied. The Fish Passage Center recommends 100 of each species present in a daily sample should be examined for condition monitoring (i.e. descaling, injuries, parasites), while a target sample size of 300-800 is needed to maintain a coefficient of variation lower than 5% for collection estimates (FPC 2020, Wagner 2007). Daily collection targets may also need to consider tagging or other research needs."

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993).

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

            "Fish handling procedures are a critical element of sampling, especially in systems with threatened or endangered species. As researchers and managers, we are obliged to handle the fish we are sampling responsibly (Nickum et al. 2004). This is an important topic that should be considered by all practitioners sampling fish. Detailed fish handing guidelines are available from Nickum et al. 2004, the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) 2005, and Stickney (1983). When markrecapture sampling, it is critical that handled and marked fish return to normal activities before the recapture sample begins to help satisfy the equal catchability assumption associated with markrecapture estimators. There are several examples of things we can do to reduce the handling stress of sampled fish. For instance, minimize sampling at water temperatures above 18 degrees Celsius, use live well colors that mimic the natural environment and included cover, avoid overcrowding fish in live wells, and segregate large predatory fish from small fish to prevent predation in the live well. Also, the zone 0.5 m from an electrofishing anode has been termed the potential zone of injury; thus fish in close proximity to the anode should be quickly removed from it while electrofishing (NMFS 2000). After removal from the water, captured fish should be held for the shortest time possible in live wells with recirculated or aerated water that has approximately the same temperature as the ambient water temperature they were removed from. An innovative live well design used for holding captured stream fish was proposed by Isaak and Hubert (1997) for stream sampling and by Sharber and Carothers (1987) for boat or raft units. Perhaps the most important consideration is to minimize handling of fish during any research or sampling activity."

            "Fyke netting is a passive capture method used for sampling juvenile salmon and steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss that use lentic habitats and estuary areas and, in some cases, stream habitats. Fyke nets are large hoop nets with wings (and/or a lead) that are attached to the first frame and act as funnels to direct swimming fish into the trap (see Figure 1). The second and third frames each hold funnel throats, which prevent fish from escaping as they enter each section. The opposite end of the net may be tied with a slip cord to facilitate fish removal. These nets are typically used in shallow water (where the first hoop is less than 1 m under the waters surface), although some lake studies have used fyke nets where the water was as deep as 10 m over the first frame. This deep-set approach has resulted in comparable data to shallower sets, except for 0-age fish where the deeper sets had lower catch values.  The net is set so that the leads intercept moving fish. When the fish try to get around the lead, they swim into the enclosure. Leads and wings are held in place by poles or anchors. Modified fyke nets have rectangular frames to enhance their stability. The square or rectangular frames prevent the net from rolling on the bottom substrate (Hubert 1996). Fyke nets are suspended between buoyant and weighted lines much like a gill net.Fyke netting is a useful method for sampling fish that use lentic habitats and estuarine areas. It is commonly used to monitor the yearly changes in fish species abundances in sites where seining cannot be used alone or in combination with other methods for a markrecapture study. If the habitat has large and uneven substrate, significant woody debris, or other obstructions, seining may not be possible, and fyke nets may provide a viable alternative. Fyke nets tend to be the most useful in capturing cover-seeking mobile species and migratory species that follow the shorelines, and have been used to a sample juvenile salmon in estuary habitat in the Skagit River in Washington (E. Beamer, Skagit River System Cooperative, personal communication). Fyke nets induce less stress on captured fish than do entanglement gears (Hopkins and Cech 1992), and most captured fish can be released unharmed. Fyke nets are widely used in the assessment of fisheries stocks because of the low mortality of fish and aspects of their species and size selectivity. Trap mortality for steelhead caught using fyke nets in the Noyo River in California was less than 1% (Gallagher 2000)."

            "Video equipment can be used to create high-quality records of fish passage using relatively inexpensive equipment and adequate lighting (Hatch et al. 1994). These data are collected at less cost than direct observation or weirs. Video also creates a permanent record of the observations, which can be reanalyzed if necessary to allow for specimen identification or development of confidence bounds on escapement estimates (Hatch et al. 1994). Staff fatigue can be reduced by spacing out the time used for interpretation or by using technology to help interpret images (Irvine et al. 1991). Recent users of video technology have been working on computer image processing automation (Hatch et al. 1994, 1998) and on recording triggered by motion detection to reduce the number of blank images on tape. Video offers a permanent record of the number of fish and often the species and size that pass an area, and it can be used to compare differences between years and site conditions as well (Hiebert et al. 2000). A permanent record is especially helpful when time constraints do not allow for immediate data analysis (Irvine et al. 1991). Additionally, video can be used to assess populations without any handling of the fish species, reducing potential stress on fish. Finally, video surveys have little impact on the environment and do not cause fish mortality. Video surveys can be used at existing facilities such as dams and fishways but can also be applied in remote locations (see Figure 1). Systems that are lightweight, transportable, and run under their own power (solar, wind, or hydrogenerated power) have been developed for remote application (Otis and Dickson 2002). Time savings from video surveys vary by application. Hatch et al. (1994) found that 3 d of migration could be reviewed in 6 h, or 2 h per d. Otis and Dickson (2002) determined total fish passage in an average of 38 min per d of video at one sample site and 16 min per d at another. An additional 29 min and 40 min per d of video were required to determine species composition at each site, respectively, using a subsample of the first 15 min of every h (Otis and Dickson 2002). Efficiency rates of 3.6% and 2.1% were calculated for these two sites, reducing the amount of staff time needed for results by 96.4% and 97.9%. Hatch et al. (1994) found an overall time savings of 92% using video surveys versus visual observation. The primary objectives of using videography with salmonids include(1) determining, or estimating, total numbers of moving or migrating fish at a sampling site;(2) determining, or estimating, species composition of moving or migrating fish at a sampling site;(3) determining, or estimating, the numbers of hatchery versus wild fish by close examination of body markers or fin clips; (4) characterizing the body sizes of fish moving or migrating past a sampling site; (5) assessing spawner and redd density, distribution, and habitat characteristics (e.g., deepwater environments); and(6) characterizing behavioral aspects of fish (e.g., mating, habitat selection, hesitation in migration)."

With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

Hydroacoustics can sample the entire water column quickly, and detailed maps of fish densities and mean sizes can be obtained over large bodies of water. As more area is encompassed by a sample, many of the sampling problems created by the spatial patchiness of fish distribution are alleviated. Thus, there tends to be less variation in density estimates across acoustic transects compared to purse-seine hauls or other gear types. Also, the frequency band used in scientific sonars (typically 38 to 200 kHz) is not detectable by most fishes (except see Mann et al. 2001; Gregory and Clabburn 2003). There remain limitations in the type of data that can be collected using hydroacoustics. Currently, single frequency hydroacoustics cannot identify the target species, though broadband and multifrequency sonar systems are showing promise in discerning species in low-diversity systems (Fernandes et al. 2003). Side-looking mobile hydroacoustics cannot discern modes in lengthfrequency distributions unless large differences in length classes exist. When these limitations are recognized, hydroacoustic sampling efforts are cost effective, as estimates from creel surveys are expensive and labor intensive, and the estimates developed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU) measures are not necessarily directly proportional to fish density (Hubert 1996:158159; Yule 2000). When used in concert with purse seining or other active sampling gears, hydroacoustics can provide a comprehensive survey method capable of providing valuable information on target size, population densities, and spatial distribution. Additional aspects of the strengths and limitations of acoustic surveys can be found in MacLennan and Simmonds (1992) and Brandt (1996)."

When researchers want to compare fish lengths of male spawners versus female spawners or hatchery spawned females versus carcasses, it is a good idea to use this type of length measurement to remove the bias of the eroded tails on female spawners.  So length measurements are made from specific parts of the body that are intact, such as the orbit and the hypural plate. The hypural plate is comprised of modified vertebrae that support the rays of the caudal fin and originate from the posterior end of the vertebral column (Figure 1)."

Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993).

The thalweg profile is a longitudinal survey of maximum flow path depth and several other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points (termed stations) along the length of the support reach measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from the thalweg profile allows calculation of indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools.

Field practitioners must physically walk each reach, using a GPS to geo-reference each habitat type, and afterwards post-process the GPS data to create a map of the reach.All months are rated the same for this attribute, although it is recognized that the relative amount of this habitat type can change over a wide range of flow levels. When rating this attribute, a moderate flow level should be assumed.

The definition applied here is from the ODFW habitat survey manual (Moore et al. 1999): an area with generally uniform depth and flow with no surface turbulence, generally in reaches of <1% gradient. Glides may have some small scour areas but are distinguished from pools by their overall homogeneity and lack of structure.

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Included in this method are instructions for collecting stream channel measurements. Thalweg refers to the flow path of the deepest water in a stream channel. The thalweg profile is a longitudinal survey of maximum flow path depth and several other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points (termed stations) along the length of the support reach measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from the thalweg profile allows calculation of indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools. This habitat assessment modifies traditional methods by measuring upstream distance in the middle of the channel, rather than along the thalweg itself (though each thalweg depth measurement is taken at the point of the deepest flow path at each station).Overview: method activities/data collected1. Measure wetted width.2. Classify the size of the bed surface particles.3. Measure depth of thalweg.4. Determine the channel unit code and pool forming element codes."

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks.

            "The ability to see and count what is under the surface of the water without disturbing the habitat or the fish is a key advantage of hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can sample the entire water column quickly, and detailed maps of fish densities and mean sizes can be obtained over large bodies of water. As more area is encompassed by a sample, many of the sampling problems created by the spatial patchiness of fish distribution are alleviated. Thus, there tends to be less variation in density estimates across acoustic transects compared to purse-seine hauls or other gear types. Also, the frequency band used in scientific sonars (typically 38 to 200 kHz) is not detectable by most fishes (except see Mann et al. 2001; Gregory and Clabburn 2003). There remain limitations in the type of data that can be collected using hydroacoustics. Currently, single frequency hydroacoustics cannot identify the target species, though broadband and multifrequency sonar systems are showing promise in discerning species in low-diversity systems (Fernandes et al. 2003). Side-looking mobile hydroacoustics cannot discern modes in lengthfrequency distributions unless large differences in length classes exist. When these limitations are recognized, hydroacoustic sampling efforts are cost effective, as estimates from creel surveys are expensive and labor intensive, and the estimates developed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU) measures are not necessarily directly proportional to fish density (Hubert 1996:158159; Yule 2000). When used in concert with purse seining or other active sampling gears, hydroacoustics can provide a comprehensive survey method capable of providing valuable information on target size, population densities, and spatial distribution. Additional aspects of the strengths and limitations of acoustic surveys can be found in MacLennan and Simmonds (1992) and Brandt (1996)."

            "Boat Electrofishing v1.0",
            "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

            "To capture X, Y, and Z coordinates as points and lines that collectively represent a topographic surface of the stream channel and floodplain. Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks. Changes made for 2012: - added water surface (ws) code - added mid-channel island (mw) code - added inflow point (in) code - added outflow point (out) code - added discharge (q) code"

With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat.

            "The ability to see and count what is under the surface of the water without disturbing the habitat or the fish is a key advantage of hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can sample the entire water column quickly, and detailed maps of fish densities and mean sizes can be obtained over large bodies of water. As more area is encompassed by a sample, many of the sampling problems created by the spatial patchiness of fish distribution are alleviated. Thus, there tends to be less variation in density estimates across acoustic transects compared to purse-seine hauls or other gear types. Also, the frequency band used in scientific sonars (typically 38 to 200 kHz) is not detectable by most fishes (except see Mann et al. 2001; Gregory and Clabburn 2003). There remain limitations in the type of data that can be collected using hydroacoustics. Currently, single frequency hydroacoustics cannot identify the target species, though broadband and multifrequency sonar systems are showing promise in discerning species in low-diversity systems (Fernandes et al. 2003). Side-looking mobile hydroacoustics cannot discern modes in lengthfrequency distributions unless large differences in length classes exist. When these limitations are recognized, hydroacoustic sampling efforts are cost effective, as estimates from creel surveys are expensive and labor intensive, and the estimates developed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU) measures are not necessarily directly proportional to fish density (Hubert 1996:158159; Yule 2000). When used in concert with purse seining or other active sampling gears, hydroacoustics can provide a comprehensive survey method capable of providing valuable information on target size, population densities, and spatial distribution. Additional aspects of the strengths and limitations of acoustic surveys can be found in MacLennan and Simmonds (1992) and Brandt (1996)."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

Riparian canopy cover over a stream is important not only for its role in moderating stream temperatures through shading, but also as an indicator of conditions that control bank stability and the potential for inputs of coarse and fine particulate organic material. Organic inputs from riparian vegetation become food for stream organisms and structure to create and maintain complex channel habitat."

            "Stream discharge is equal to the product of the mean current velocity and vertical cross sectional area of flowing water.  Discharge measurements are important for assessing trends in streamwater acidity and other characteristics that are very sensitive to streamflow differences.  Stream discharge information is also useful in interpreting the representativeness of water chemistry data and some physical habitat information.  The response design for stream discharge involves a single determination at suitable location within the support reach to characterize conditions at the sampling point.  The location selected should be as close as possible to the location where chemical samples are collected, so that these data correspond.  No single method for measuring discharge is applicable to all types of stream channels.  The preferred procedure is based on velocity-area methods, and provides either the measurement data to calculate discharge or the calculated value for stream discharge.  For streams too small or too shallow there are 2 other methods: neutrally bouyant velocity procedure and  timed filling procedure."

The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

The thalweg profile is a longitudinal survey of maximum flow path depth and several other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points (termed stations) along the length of the support reach measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from the thalweg profile allows calculation of indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools. This habitat assessment modifies traditional methods by measuring upstream distance in the middle of the channel, rather than along the thalweg itself (though each thalweg depth measurement is taken at the point of the deepest flow path at each station).Overview: method activities/data collected1.

The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

            "The ability to see and count what is under the surface of the water without disturbing the habitat or the fish is a key advantage of hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can sample the entire water column quickly, and detailed maps of fish densities and mean sizes can be obtained over large bodies of water. As more area is encompassed by a sample, many of the sampling problems created by the spatial patchiness of fish distribution are alleviated. Thus, there tends to be less variation in density estimates across acoustic transects compared to purse-seine hauls or other gear types. Also, the frequency band used in scientific sonars (typically 38 to 200 kHz) is not detectable by most fishes (except see Mann et al. 2001; Gregory and Clabburn 2003). There remain limitations in the type of data that can be collected using hydroacoustics. Currently, single frequency hydroacoustics cannot identify the target species, though broadband and multifrequency sonar systems are showing promise in discerning species in low-diversity systems (Fernandes et al. 2003). Side-looking mobile hydroacoustics cannot discern modes in lengthfrequency distributions unless large differences in length classes exist. When these limitations are recognized, hydroacoustic sampling efforts are cost effective, as estimates from creel surveys are expensive and labor intensive, and the estimates developed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU) measures are not necessarily directly proportional to fish density (Hubert 1996:158159; Yule 2000). When used in concert with purse seining or other active sampling gears, hydroacoustics can provide a comprehensive survey method capable of providing valuable information on target size, population densities, and spatial distribution. Additional aspects of the strengths and limitations of acoustic surveys can be found in MacLennan and Simmonds (1992) and Brandt (1996)."

            "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

The use of snorkel surveys for markrecapture estimates provides a calibration factor for the counting efficiency of snorkel surveys as compared to other methods such as electrofishing and seining. For this technique to be used, the system should be closed off with block nets so that the total population observed is constant. For markrecapture estimates, fish need to be collected, marked, and released back to the sample area. Collection occurs with electrofishing, seining, or trapping; marking is done using tags or dyes with color coding or patterns; and release is into the sample reach. Snorkel surveys can then be conducted in the same sample reach to count the number of marked fish. The ratio of the number of fish resighted (i.e., those with marks that are counted) can be used as a calibration factor for the effectiveness of a snorkel survey compared to other survey methods. Fish can be marked differently based on size-class and species recorded by observers, which can help identify those species and size-classes that may have been undercounted using a snorkel survey approach."

Finding a good rock is the most important step to a successful sensor installation. The best rocks are large enough that they often protrude a foot or more above the low flow water surface and wide enough that they can effectively shield the sensor from moving rocks or debris during floods. Ideal site characteristics downstream of large rocks are pockets of relatively calm water with smaller substrate sizes. If large rocks and cobbles are on the downstream side, similarly large substrates are likely to move there again during the next flood and could dislodge the sensor. Finally, the rock should provide a relatively flat downstream attachment surface that is deep enough to remain submerged and in or near flowing water for the entire year. Large substrates suitable for attachment may be relatively rare within low-gradient, meadow reaches, and in these instances, seek steeper channels immediately up or downstream of the meadow. Immobile structures like bridge footings may be considered but we do not recommend attachment to large logs, as they may decay over time."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

The thalweg profile is a longitudinal survey of maximum flow path depth and several other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points (termed stations) along the length of the support reach measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from the thalweg profile allows calculation of indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools. This habitat assessment modifies traditional methods by measuring upstream distance in the middle of the channel, rather than along the thalweg itself (though each thalweg depth measurement is taken at the point of the deepest flow path at each station).Overview: method activities/data collected1.

Fish to be tagged may or may not be anesthetized first, and will depend on the species and how quickly they can be handled during the tagging process.Anchor tags are composed of a T-shaped (T-bar) or barbed (dart) attachment end that is embedded in the fish.

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

The response design for stream discharge involves a single determination at suitable location within the support reach to characterize conditions at the sampling point.

No single method for measuring discharge is applicable to all types of stream channels.

            "The ability to see and count what is under the surface of the water without disturbing the habitat or the fish is a key advantage of hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can sample the entire water column quickly, and detailed maps of fish densities and mean sizes can be obtained over large bodies of water. As more area is encompassed by a sample, many of the sampling problems created by the spatial patchiness of fish distribution are alleviated. Thus, there tends to be less variation in density estimates across acoustic transects compared to purse-seine hauls or other gear types. Also, the frequency band used in scientific sonars (typically 38 to 200 kHz) is not detectable by most fishes (except see Mann et al. 2001; Gregory and Clabburn 2003). There remain limitations in the type of data that can be collected using hydroacoustics. Currently, single frequency hydroacoustics cannot identify the target species, though broadband and multifrequency sonar systems are showing promise in discerning species in low-diversity systems (Fernandes et al. 2003). Side-looking mobile hydroacoustics cannot discern modes in lengthfrequency distributions unless large differences in length classes exist. When these limitations are recognized, hydroacoustic sampling efforts are cost effective, as estimates from creel surveys are expensive and labor intensive, and the estimates developed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU) measures are not necessarily directly proportional to fish density (Hubert 1996:158159; Yule 2000). When used in concert with purse seining or other active sampling gears, hydroacoustics can provide a comprehensive survey method capable of providing valuable information on target size, population densities, and spatial distribution. Additional aspects of the strengths and limitations of acoustic surveys can be found in MacLennan and Simmonds (1992) and Brandt (1996)."

            "This methodshould be used to determine whether the designed fish passage criteria are met post-construction such that fish passage remains possible. The purpose is to determine whether an engineered solution to a fish passage problem remains viable for at least five years. Natural stream channels provide the benchmark for the passage of all fish for the various life stages at which they migrate. The further a crossing structure (e.g., dam, culvert) departs from the prevailing natural condition, the more impaired fish passage typically becomes. The degree to which the completed passage structure complies with design criteria could measure effectiveness.New stream crossing structures and restoration of fish passage at identified fish passage barriers should utilize design criteria provided through WDFW in the Water Crossing Design Guidelines (Barnard et al. 2013). The methodology in this section will encompass the data necessary to complete evaluations of fish passage structures found inFish Passage Barrier and Surface Water Diversion Screen Assessment and Prioritization(WDFW 2009). These guidelines are based on best available science related to fish passage. In addition to those criteria, the gradient of the fish passage structure will be measured and compared to the original design criteria. Deviations of greater than 20% shall be considered out of compliance.Projects designed and constructed to criteria in the above-referenced guidance documents are presumed to provide fish passage. Therefore, monitoring of project design upon completion of construction and over time constitutes the most appropriate and measurable effectiveness monitoring. Additionally, to assess whether partial fish passage barriers have been improved, it is necessary to evaluate adult and juvenile fish densities to determine whether increased fish utilization has been accomplished."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

Fish to be tagged may or may not be anesthetized first, and will depend on the species and how quickly they can be handled during the tagging process.Anchor tags are composed of a T-shaped (T-bar) or barbed (dart) attachment end that is embedded in the fish. The other end is a colored plastic tube or streamer that typically has information about the project printed on it (Zale et al. 2012).

The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

            "Because velocity and depth typically vary greatly across a stream, accuracy in field measurements is achieved by measuring the mean velocity and flow cross-sectional area of many increments across a channel (Figure 22). Each increment gives a subtotal of the stream discharge, and the whole is calculated as the sum of these parts. Discharge measurements are made at only one carefully chosen channel cross-section. It is important to choose a channel cross-section that is as much like a canal as possible. A glide area with a U-shaped channel cross-section that is free of obstructions provides the best conditions for measuring discharge. You may remove rocks and other obstructions to improve the cross-section before any measurements are made."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

The RBT allows users to describe and measure river channels using high resolution digital elevation models (DEM). The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit. For additional information see: http://essa.com/tools/RBT/highlight/ The CHaMP - Topographic Point Collection Methods provides background on collection of the measurement data that are analyzed for this calculation. http://www.monitoringmethods.org/Method/Details/836"

            "It is often difficult for fisheries researchers and managers to obtain a numeric estimate of a given fish stock fora variety of reasons (e.g., time, funding, logistics, etc.). In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

The purpose is to determine whether an engineered solution to a fish passage problem remains viable for at least five years. Natural stream channels provide the benchmark for the passage of all fish for the various life stages at which they migrate. The further a crossing structure (e.g., dam, culvert) departs from the prevailing natural condition, the more impaired fish passage typically becomes. The degree to which the completed passage structure complies with design criteria could measure effectiveness.New stream crossing structures and restoration of fish passage at identified fish passage barriers should utilize design criteria provided through WDFW in the Water Crossing Design Guidelines (Barnard et al. 2013). The methodology in this section will encompass the data necessary to complete evaluations of fish passage structures found inFish Passage Barrier and Surface Water Diversion Screen Assessment and Prioritization(WDFW 2009). These guidelines are based on best available science related to fish passage. In addition to those criteria, the gradient of the fish passage structure will be measured and compared to the original design criteria. Deviations of greater than 20% shall be considered out of compliance.Projects designed and constructed to criteria in the above-referenced guidance documents are presumed to provide fish passage. Therefore, monitoring of project design upon completion of construction and over time constitutes the most appropriate and measurable effectiveness monitoring. Additionally, to assess whether partial fish passage barriers have been improved, it is necessary to evaluate adult and juvenile fish densities to determine whether increased fish utilization has been accomplished."

            "Stream discharge is equal to the product of the mean current velocity and vertical cross sectional area of flowing water.  Discharge measurements are important for assessing trends in streamwater acidity and other characteristics that are very sensitive to streamflow differences.  Stream discharge information is also useful in interpreting the representativeness of water chemistry data and some physical habitat information.  The response design for stream discharge involves a single determination at suitable location within the support reach to characterize conditions at the sampling point.  The location selected should be as close as possible to the location where chemical samples are collected, so that these data correspond.  No single method for measuring discharge is applicable to all types of stream channels.  The preferred procedure is based on velocity-area methods, and provides either the measurement data to calculate discharge or the calculated value for stream discharge.  For streams too small or too shallow there are 2 other methods: neutrally bouyant velocity procedure and  timed filling procedure."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

The thalweg profile is a longitudinal survey of maximum flow path depth and several other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points (termed stations) along the length of the support reach measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from the thalweg profile allows calculation of indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools.

Unseasonable (high or low) changes in water temperature can greatly disrupt fish life cycles and health and can result in premature mortality (Alabaster and Lloyd). Thus water temperature isan important measurement for determining the health of the sampling site.Oxygen ispotentially as important as organic substrates derived from food in determining the energy budget for fish. Dissolved oxygen (DO) availability likely affects the ecology of fishesthrough the availability of energy for locomotion, growth, and reproduction (Kramer 1987). Diminished DO concentrations, which can occur with increasing temperatures, can cause behavioral changes in fish, habitat selection changes, and mortality (Kramer 1987; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013).Specific conductance is also an important indicator of ecosystem health. Specific conductance can be a useful indicator of macroinvertebratediversity and richness (Walters et al. 2009; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013), and elevated conductivity has beenlinked to increased urbanization and altered macroinvertebrate assemblages (Walters et al. 2009). Because macroinvertebratesare a common food source of many fish species, it is no surprise that macroinvertebrate densities and fish densities are often positively correlated (Walters et al. 2009).Food webs are inherently dependent on the health of the ecosystem. Water quality measurements like temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygenhelp identify ecosystem health and thus provideessential data for long term resource monitoring and specifically fish monitoring."

Each increment gives a subtotal of the stream discharge, and the whole is calculated as the sum of these parts. Discharge measurements are made at only one carefully chosen channel cross-section. It is important to choose a channel cross-section that is as much like a canal as possible. A glide area with a U-shaped channel cross-section that is free of obstructions provides the best conditions for measuring discharge. You may remove rocks and other obstructions to improve the cross-section before any measurements are made."

Hydroacoustics can sample the entire water column quickly, and detailed maps of fish densities and mean sizes can be obtained over large bodies of water. As more area is encompassed by a sample, many of the sampling problems created by the spatial patchiness of fish distribution are alleviated. Thus, there tends to be less variation in density estimates across acoustic transects compared to purse-seine hauls or other gear types. Also, the frequency band used in scientific sonars (typically 38 to 200 kHz) is not detectable by most fishes (except see Mann et al. 2001; Gregory and Clabburn 2003). There remain limitations in the type of data that can be collected using hydroacoustics. Currently, single frequency hydroacoustics cannot identify the target species, though broadband and multifrequency sonar systems are showing promise in discerning species in low-diversity systems (Fernandes et al. 2003). Side-looking mobile hydroacoustics cannot discern modes in lengthfrequency distributions unless large differences in length classes exist. When these limitations are recognized, hydroacoustic sampling efforts are cost effective, as estimates from creel surveys are expensive and labor intensive, and the estimates developed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU) measures are not necessarily directly proportional to fish density (Hubert 1996:158159; Yule 2000). When used in concert with purse seining or other active sampling gears, hydroacoustics can provide a comprehensive survey method capable of providing valuable information on target size, population densities, and spatial distribution. Additional aspects of the strengths and limitations of acoustic surveys can be found in MacLennan and Simmonds (1992) and Brandt (1996)."

With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

The use of snorkel surveys for markrecapture estimates provides a calibration factor for the counting efficiency of snorkel surveys as compared to other methods such as electrofishing and seining. For this technique to be used, the system should be closed off with block nets so that the total population observed is constant. For markrecapture estimates, fish need to be collected, marked, and released back to the sample area. Collection occurs with electrofishing, seining, or trapping; marking is done using tags or dyes with color coding or patterns; and release is into the sample reach. Snorkel surveys can then be conducted in the same sample reach to count the number of marked fish. The ratio of the number of fish resighted (i.e., those with marks that are counted) can be used as a calibration factor for the effectiveness of a snorkel survey compared to other survey methods. Fish can be marked differently based on size-class and species recorded by observers, which can help identify those species and size-classes that may have been undercounted using a snorkel survey approach."

The best rocks are large enough that they often protrude a foot or more above the low flow water surface and wide enough that they can effectively shield the sensor from moving rocks or debris during floods. Ideal site characteristics downstream of large rocks are pockets of relatively calm water with smaller substrate sizes. If large rocks and cobbles are on the downstream side, similarly large substrates are likely to move there again during the next flood and could dislodge the sensor. Finally, the rock should provide a relatively flat downstream attachment surface that is deep enough to remain submerged and in or near flowing water for the entire year. Large substrates suitable for attachment may be relatively rare within low-gradient, meadow reaches, and in these instances, seek steeper channels immediately up or downstream of the meadow.

The RBT is being actively developed by ESSA Technologies and is available for free. The goal is to characterize in-stream and floodplain geomorphology to support aquatic habitat analyses and numerical models of flow and sediment transport. Tools were created for ArcGIS to conduct several types of analyses associated with DEMs, including geomorphic change detection, uncertainty analyses, user-defined density of cross-sections and longitudinal profiles. These tools can extract hydrologic parameters such as wetted area, bankfull width, water depths, hydraulic radius, gradient, sinuosity (McKean et al. 2009), erosion and depositional patterns and budgets, and uncertainty in the DEM (Wheaton et al. 2010). Using an automated detrending algorithm we are able to remove the overall valley slope. Tools are being created that use the detrended raster to investigate flooding outside a main channel at any prescribed discharge or flow stage. The RBT will also allow users to recreate other survey protocols that use cross-sectional and longitudinal profile approaches. The CHaMP - Topographic Point Collection Methods (Method ID:5328) provides background on collection of the X, Y, Z point measurement data used to generated the DEM that is analyzed for this calculation."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

            "The ability to see and count what is under the surface of the water without disturbing the habitat or the fish is a key advantage of hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can sample the entire water column quickly, and detailed maps of fish densities and mean sizes can be obtained over large bodies of water. As more area is encompassed by a sample, many of the sampling problems created by the spatial patchiness of fish distribution are alleviated. Thus, there tends to be less variation in density estimates across acoustic transects compared to purse-seine hauls or other gear types. Also, the frequency band used in scientific sonars (typically 38 to 200 kHz) is not detectable by most fishes (except see Mann et al. 2001; Gregory and Clabburn 2003). There remain limitations in the type of data that can be collected using hydroacoustics. Currently, single frequency hydroacoustics cannot identify the target species, though broadband and multifrequency sonar systems are showing promise in discerning species in low-diversity systems (Fernandes et al. 2003). Side-looking mobile hydroacoustics cannot discern modes in lengthfrequency distributions unless large differences in length classes exist. When these limitations are recognized, hydroacoustic sampling efforts are cost effective, as estimates from creel surveys are expensive and labor intensive, and the estimates developed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPEU) measures are not necessarily directly proportional to fish density (Hubert 1996:158159; Yule 2000). When used in concert with purse seining or other active sampling gears, hydroacoustics can provide a comprehensive survey method capable of providing valuable information on target size, population densities, and spatial distribution. Additional aspects of the strengths and limitations of acoustic surveys can be found in MacLennan and Simmonds (1992) and Brandt (1996)."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

It is designed for arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, dominated by willow and shrub-steppe. This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor the greenline before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation at the greenline.Streamside vegetation and GGW are significant indicators of the levels of incision and riparian health (Burton et al. 2011). Because changes occur most rapidly at the greenline due to high levels of disturbance, greenline vegetation data can be used to make early management decisions (Winward 2000). There are a variety of stream health indicators that can be assessed, using the data metrics collected at the greenline. For example: the presence or absence of deep rooted perennial vegetation can indicate how susceptible the streambank is to erosion; the types of hydrophilic species present can indicate the successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity; the abundance of invasive exotic species found at the greenline (due to high levels of disturbance) can indicate the degree to which the area is susceptible to the establishment of invasive species. Measuring the GGW will provide a more general view into landscape level changes. Over time, changing GGW indicates the degree of sediment aggradation occurring to create a wider stream networks, a key component to improving habitat complexity within and along narrow, incised channels (Pollock et al. 2007) and how quickly this change is occurring.Greenline data measurements are collected in pairs, one on each side of the channel, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1). The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton et al. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008). The measurements taken within the quadrat, in conjunction with information about each quadrats location along the reach, can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization (browse), and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence."

Finding a good rock is the most important step to a successful sensor installation. The best rocks are large enough that they often protrude a foot or more above the low flow water surface and wide enough that they can effectively shield the sensor from moving rocks or debris during floods. Ideal site characteristics downstream of large rocks are pockets of relatively calm water with smaller substrate sizes. If large rocks and cobbles are on the downstream side, similarly large substrates are likely to move there again during the next flood and could dislodge the sensor. Finally, the rock should provide a relatively flat downstream attachment surface that is deep enough to remain submerged and in or near flowing water for the entire year. Large substrates suitable for attachment may be relatively rare within low-gradient, meadow reaches, and in these instances, seek steeper channels immediately up or downstream of the meadow. Immobile structures like bridge footings may be considered but we do not recommend attachment to large logs, as they may decay over time."

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

            "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

            "Water Quality Measurements Using a Conductivity/DO/Temperature Meter v1.0",
            "Standardizing sampling effort, techniques, and gear is critical to allow for comparisons of data among field stations. A suite of environmental measurements are recorded at every site immediately before sampling for fishes. Measurements or observations are taken at the anticipated midpoint of a run (electrofishing, trawling) or at the net location for sampling locations with stationary gear (fyke netting, hoop netting).Water temperature is an essential indicator of freshwater fish health and ecosystem health. Water temperature influences fish metabolic rates, gonad development, fry and fish behavior, and fish embryo development time (Alabaster and Lloyd 2013). Unseasonable (high or low) changes in water temperature can greatly disrupt fish life cycles and health and can result in premature mortality (Alabaster and Lloyd). Thus water temperature isan important measurement for determining the health of the sampling site.Oxygen ispotentially as important as organic substrates derived from food in determining the energy budget for fish. Dissolved oxygen (DO) availability likely affects the ecology of fishesthrough the availability of energy for locomotion, growth, and reproduction (Kramer 1987). Diminished DO concentrations, which can occur with increasing temperatures, can cause behavioral changes in fish, habitat selection changes, and mortality (Kramer 1987; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013).Specific conductance is also an important indicator of ecosystem health. Specific conductance can be a useful indicator of macroinvertebratediversity and richness (Walters et al. 2009; Alabaster and Lloyd 2013), and elevated conductivity has beenlinked to increased urbanization and altered macroinvertebrate assemblages (Walters et al. 2009). Because macroinvertebratesare a common food source of many fish species, it is no surprise that macroinvertebrate densities and fish densities are often positively correlated (Walters et al. 2009).Food webs are inherently dependent on the health of the ecosystem. Water quality measurements like temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygenhelp identify ecosystem health and thus provideessential data for long term resource monitoring and specifically fish monitoring."

The RBT is being actively developed by ESSA Technologies and is available for free. The goal is to characterize in-stream and floodplain geomorphology to support aquatic habitat analyses and numerical models of flow and sediment transport. Tools were created for ArcGIS to conduct several types of analyses associated with DEMs, including geomorphic change detection, uncertainty analyses, user-defined density of cross-sections and longitudinal profiles. These tools can extract hydrologic parameters such as wetted area, bankfull width, water depths, hydraulic radius, gradient, sinuosity (McKean et al. 2009), erosion and depositional patterns and budgets, and uncertainty in the DEM (Wheaton et al. 2010). Using an automated detrending algorithm we are able to remove the overall valley slope. Tools are being created that use the detrended raster to investigate flooding outside a main channel at any prescribed discharge or flow stage. The RBT will also allow users to recreate other survey protocols that use cross-sectional and longitudinal profile approaches. The CHaMP - Topographic Point Collection Methods (Method ID:5328) provides background on collection of the X, Y, Z point measurement data used to generated the DEM that is analyzed for this calculation."

Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks.

It is designed for arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, dominated by willow and shrub-steppe. This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor the greenline before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation at the greenline.Streamside vegetation and GGW are significant indicators of the levels of incision and riparian health (Burton et al. 2011). Because changes occur most rapidly at the greenline due to high levels of disturbance, greenline vegetation data can be used to make early management decisions (Winward 2000). There are a variety of stream health indicators that can be assessed, using the data metrics collected at the greenline. For example: the presence or absence of deep rooted perennial vegetation can indicate how susceptible the streambank is to erosion; the types of hydrophilic species present can indicate the successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity; the abundance of invasive exotic species found at the greenline (due to high levels of disturbance) can indicate the degree to which the area is susceptible to the establishment of invasive species. Measuring the GGW will provide a more general view into landscape level changes. Over time, changing GGW indicates the degree of sediment aggradation occurring to create a wider stream networks, a key component to improving habitat complexity within and along narrow, incised channels (Pollock et al. 2007) and how quickly this change is occurring.Greenline data measurements are collected in pairs, one on each side of the channel, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1). The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton et al. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008). The measurements taken within the quadrat, in conjunction with information about each quadrats location along the reach, can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization (browse), and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence."

The following criteria should be used when considering sections of channel for delineation as unique channel units: 1. In general, channel units are at least as long as the wetted channel width. 2. Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4. Falls, steps, and plunge pools are rarely as long as the wetted channel width, but should be delineated as separate channel units due to their importance as fish habitat and areas of topographic complexity."

Snorkelers approach each object andestimate its size. Live fishof known size can also be used. One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size.

It is designed for arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, dominated by willow and shrub-steppe. This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor the greenline before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation at the greenline.Streamside vegetation and GGW are significant indicators of the levels of incision and riparian health (Burton et al. 2011). Because changes occur most rapidly at the greenline due to high levels of disturbance, greenline vegetation data can be used to make early management decisions (Winward 2000). There are a variety of stream health indicators that can be assessed, using the data metrics collected at the greenline. For example: the presence or absence of deep rooted perennial vegetation can indicate how susceptible the streambank is to erosion; the types of hydrophilic species present can indicate the successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity; the abundance of invasive exotic species found at the greenline (due to high levels of disturbance) can indicate the degree to which the area is susceptible to the establishment of invasive species. Measuring the GGW will provide a more general view into landscape level changes. Over time, changing GGW indicates the degree of sediment aggradation occurring to create a wider stream networks, a key component to improving habitat complexity within and along narrow, incised channels (Pollock et al. 2007) and how quickly this change is occurring.Greenline data measurements are collected in pairs, one on each side of the channel, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1). The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton et al. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008). The measurements taken within the quadrat, in conjunction with information about each quadrats location along the reach, can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization (browse), and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence."

In reforestation areas, tree densities of 400-700 trees per acre are commonly used at the time of planting.  It is normally anticipated that tree loss will occur and that after 3-5 years 50% or more will have succumbed to competition, browsing or some other effect.  Normal timberlands in the Pacific Northwest thinned for wood production will contain 30 trees/acre for Douglas fir and up to 60 trees per acre for planted hemlock and alder.

Channel units are delineated according to a two-tiered hierarchical classification schema (Fig 11). The following criteria should be used when considering sections of channel for delineation as unique channel units: 1. In general, channel units are at least as long as the wetted channel width. 2. Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4. Falls, steps, and plunge pools are rarely as long as the wetted channel width, but should be delineated as separate channel units due to their importance as fish habitat and areas of topographic complexity."

The response design for stream discharge involves a single determination at suitable location within the support reach to characterize conditions at the sampling point.  The location selected should be as close as possible to the location where chemical samples are collected, so that these data correspond.  No single method for measuring discharge is applicable to all types of stream channels.

The following criteria should be used when considering sections of channel for delineation as unique channel units: 1. In general, channel units are at least as long as the wetted channel width. 2. Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4. Falls, steps, and plunge pools are rarely as long as the wetted channel width, but should be delineated as separate channel units due to their importance as fish habitat and areas of topographic complexity."

The RBT is being actively developed by ESSA Technologies and is available for free. The goal is to characterize in-stream and floodplain geomorphology to support aquatic habitat analyses and numerical models of flow and sediment transport. Tools were created for ArcGIS to conduct several types of analyses associated with DEMs, including geomorphic change detection, uncertainty analyses, user-defined density of cross-sections and longitudinal profiles. These tools can extract hydrologic parameters such as wetted area, bankfull width, water depths, hydraulic radius, gradient, sinuosity (McKean et al. 2009), erosion and depositional patterns and budgets, and uncertainty in the DEM (Wheaton et al. 2010). Using an automated detrending algorithm we are able to remove the overall valley slope. Tools are being created that use the detrended raster to investigate flooding outside a main channel at any prescribed discharge or flow stage. The RBT will also allow users to recreate other survey protocols that use cross-sectional and longitudinal profile approaches. The CHaMP - Topographic Point Collection Methods (Method ID:5328) provides background on collection of the X, Y, Z point measurement data used to generated the DEM that is analyzed for this calculation."

Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks.

            "Background:Data collected from groundwater monitoring are used to detect changes in water table elevation and groundwater temperature patterns. Changes in water table elevation and groundwater temperature are anintended result of certain restoration activities (e.g., floodplain reconnection projects) and monitoring these patterns can help provide evidence that restoration work is achieving project goals.This method describes ananalysis procedure for groundwater temperature data, and assumes that data were collected in at least one reference site (which received no manipulations for the purpose of restoration) and one treated site (where restoration activities have occurred). The goal of the analysis is to compare the amplitude and synchronicity of groundwater and surface water temperature cycles in restored and reference areas. Groundwater temperature patterns are expected to more closely align with surface water patterns in areas where groundwater is closer to the land surface (Stonestrom and Constantz, 2003). If such alignment occurs, these data provide corroborating evidence of water table rise and groundwater-surface water exchange (e.g., groundwater recharge from overbank inundation). This is an important goal for some restoration projects.This procedure models seasonal oscillations in groundwater and surface water temperature in order to examine their amplitude and timing and to evaluate how these parameters have changed since restoration. This methodassumes that groundwater data were collected from wells installed as part of a restoration monitoring design and instrumented with Onset HOBOU20Water Level Loggers (U20probes), and that data were collected at a resolution of one reading per hour or two hours for the duration of the monitoring period. Similarly, hourly monitoring data from surface water temperature loggers (e.g., Onset Tidbit v2 or Stowaway XTI loggers) located near the treated and control sites are also prerequisites for this analysis.Analysis of water table elevation data isdiscussed in a separate method."

A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used.Netting cannot be used to effectively capture rainbow trout, so the AIP is essentially the sole method to reduce rainbow trout predation on kokanee. Additionally, population modeling suggested angling was a critical component needed to effectively collapse the lake trout population (Hansen et al. 2010)."

As researchers and managers, we are obliged to handle the fish we are sampling responsibly (Nickum et al. 2004). This is an important topic that should be considered by all practitioners sampling fish. Detailed fish handing guidelines are available from Nickum et al. 2004, the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) 2005, and Stickney (1983). When markrecapture sampling, it is critical that handled and marked fish return to normal activities before the recapture sample begins to help satisfy the equal catchability assumption associated with markrecapture estimators. There are several examples of things we can do to reduce the handling stress of sampled fish. For instance, minimize sampling at water temperatures above 18 degrees Celsius, use live well colors that mimic the natural environment and included cover, avoid overcrowding fish in live wells, and segregate large predatory fish from small fish to prevent predation in the live well. Also, the zone 0.5 m from an electrofishing anode has been termed the potential zone of injury; thus fish in close proximity to the anode should be quickly removed from it while electrofishing (NMFS 2000). After removal from the water, captured fish should be held for the shortest time possible in live wells with recirculated or aerated water that has approximately the same temperature as the ambient water temperature they were removed from. An innovative live well design used for holding captured stream fish was proposed by Isaak and Hubert (1997) for stream sampling and by Sharber and Carothers (1987) for boat or raft units. Perhaps the most important consideration is to minimize handling of fish during any research or sampling activity."

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Slow water units separated by a small gradient drop should have a unit between them even if it is not as long as it is wide. 3. In large streams (> width category 10) slow water unit types (scour pools and off-channel units) that provide significant fish habitat that are not as long as the wetted channel is wide should also be considered for unit delineation. 4. Falls, steps, and plunge pools are rarely as long as the wetted channel width, but should be delineated as separate channel units due to their importance as fish habitat and areas of topographic complexity."

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

There are a number of tools and techniques that geneticists use to infer genetic population structure for GSI purposes. Two widely used software programs that use Bayesian clustering methods for this purpose are BAPS  and STRUCTURE.  The methods in these programs operate by creating population clusters in which the assumptions of HardyWeinberg and linkage equilibrium are met, and simultaneously each individual is assigned to a cluster based on probabilistic modeling.

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

Because procedures are quick and don't require special equipment, they are inexpensive.Clipped fins may regenerate, but usually remain recognizable as the fish ages. But, because there are a limited number of combinations of fins to clip and there is uncertainty due to regeneration, the use of fin clips is limited in some studies.

            "In the past, we have estimated salmonid abundances using multiple-pass removal depletion methods. Though multipass-depletion estimates are useful for examining site-specific temporal trends, the large degree of within-year variability among site estimates that has commonly been documented in our surveys does not permit a reliable examination of abundance when estimates are expanded to larger spatial scales (Firehammer et al. 2009). Because of this shortcoming and the desire to increase sampling efficiency, an index of site abundance was preferable to an absolute estimate, and was found to track true abundance over time (Firehammer et al. 2011). Others have also found single-pass indices to perform well in predicting abundances for salmonid populations in small-streams (Jones and Stockwell 1995; Kruse et al. 1998; Bateman et al. 2005). More importantly, we found that depletion estimates underestimated the true abundance, primarily as a result of an overestimation of capture probability during subsequent passes, which was consistent with other studies that documented biases associated with depletion-removal estimates for salmonids in small stream systems (Peterson et al. 2004; Rosenberger and Dunham 2005). Results from trend analyses also indicated that first pass catch data provided similar interpretations of watershed-wide abundance trends in salmonids as did our removal-depletion estimates (Firehammer et al. 2011). These results lend support to using first-pass catch rather than multi-pass depletion estimates to examine long-term reach trajectories in our watersheds."

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

More simply, DFAis useful for determining whether a set of variables is effective in predicting category membership. Discriminant function analysis is the preferred and most commonly used multivariate assignment techniquewhen dealing with isotopic ratio data with the intent of assigning fish to an origin location (Nowling et al. 2011; Gahagan et al. 2012). Discriminant function analysis maintains the following assumptions that should be considered, although this technique is typically robust to slight violations of these assumptions.1) multivariate normality2) homoscedasticity3) non-multicollinearity4) independenceThe following text was paraphrased from Poulsen and French (http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/discrim/discrim.pdf)Discriminant function analysis can be broken into two steps. The first step is testing the significance of a set of discriminant functions. The second step is classification.In the first step there is a matrix of total variances and covariances, and there is also a matrix of pooled within-group variances and covariances. The two matrices are compared via multivariate F tests in order to determine whether or not there are any significant differences (with regard to all variables) between groups. The multivariate test is performed first to determine which of the variables have significantly different means across the groups. Once group means are found to be statistically significant, classification of variables is undertaken. Discriminant function analysis automatically determines some optimal combination of variables so that the first function provides the most overall discrimination between groups, the second provides second most, and so on. Moreover, the functions will be independent or orthogonal, that is, their contributions to the discrimination between groups will not overlap. The first function picks up the most variation; the second function picks up the greatest part of the unexplained variation, etc. Computationally, a canonical correlation analysis is performed that will determine the successive functions and canonical roots. Classification is then possible from the canonical functions. Subjects are classified in the groups in which they had the highest classification scores. The maximum number of discriminant functions will be equal to the degrees of freedom, or the number of variables in the analysis, whichever is smaller."

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water).

Following a recovery period (during which fish will be held within live-wells oxygenated by ambient stream flow and electric aerators) crews will return marked fish to the sample unit with respect to survey observations.  Double block nets will be employed at units subject to closed-population mark-recapture modeling, with the area between primary and secondary nets surveyed to evaluate violation of closed-population assumptions.    Surveys will be conducted utilizing Smith-Root LR-24 24 volt backpack units fitted with 11 ring anodes and rat-tail cathodes.  These electrofishing units will be programmed to output pulsed DC current with frequency, duty cycle, and voltage settings adjusted relative to reach conductivity and temperature.  Each electrofishing crew will consist of one operator and two netters, assignment of duties remaining fixed throughout the project.  Double block nets (1/4 in. mesh) will be deployed at the upper and lower ends of transects subject to closed-population modeling.  Electrofishing will begin at the bottom of each transect and move upstream, with shocked fish being netted.   Single pass electrofishing occurs in much the same manner, but no block nets are used and no fish are marked."

            "Video equipment can be used to create high-quality records of fish passage using relatively inexpensive equipment and adequate lighting (Hatch et al. 1994). These data are collected at less cost than direct observation or weirs. Video also creates a permanent record of the observations, which can be reanalyzed if necessary to allow for specimen identification or development of confidence bounds on escapement estimates (Hatch et al. 1994). Staff fatigue can be reduced by spacing out the time used for interpretation or by using technology to help interpret images (Irvine et al. 1991). Recent users of video technology have been working on computer image processing automation (Hatch et al. 1994, 1998) and on recording triggered by motion detection to reduce the number of blank images on tape. Video offers a permanent record of the number of fish and often the species and size that pass an area, and it can be used to compare differences between years and site conditions as well (Hiebert et al. 2000). A permanent record is especially helpful when time constraints do not allow for immediate data analysis (Irvine et al. 1991). Additionally, video can be used to assess populations without any handling of the fish species, reducing potential stress on fish. Finally, video surveys have little impact on the environment and do not cause fish mortality. Video surveys can be used at existing facilities such as dams and fishways but can also be applied in remote locations (see Figure 1). Systems that are lightweight, transportable, and run under their own power (solar, wind, or hydrogenerated power) have been developed for remote application (Otis and Dickson 2002). Time savings from video surveys vary by application. Hatch et al. (1994) found that 3 d of migration could be reviewed in 6 h, or 2 h per d. Otis and Dickson (2002) determined total fish passage in an average of 38 min per d of video at one sample site and 16 min per d at another. An additional 29 min and 40 min per d of video were required to determine species composition at each site, respectively, using a subsample of the first 15 min of every h (Otis and Dickson 2002). Efficiency rates of 3.6% and 2.1% were calculated for these two sites, reducing the amount of staff time needed for results by 96.4% and 97.9%. Hatch et al. (1994) found an overall time savings of 92% using video surveys versus visual observation. The primary objectives of using videography with salmonids include(1) determining, or estimating, total numbers of moving or migrating fish at a sampling site;(2) determining, or estimating, species composition of moving or migrating fish at a sampling site;(3) determining, or estimating, the numbers of hatchery versus wild fish by close examination of body markers or fin clips; (4) characterizing the body sizes of fish moving or migrating past a sampling site; (5) assessing spawner and redd density, distribution, and habitat characteristics (e.g., deepwater environments); and(6) characterizing behavioral aspects of fish (e.g., mating, habitat selection, hesitation in migration)."

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

However, purchasing non-denatured ethanol is usually expensive and requires permits. In addition, shipping ethanol preserved samples requires special packaging and declaration. Finally, ethanol preserved samples need to be checked for evaporation and for dilution, and are best stored in a refrigerator or freezer. An alternative to chemical dessication are dry preservation techniques (Lahood et al 2008). The outline below describes a method for sampling and storing fish tissue on cellulose-based filter paper.

The CRITFC lab also developed and tested hundreds of additional SNP loci specifically for projects involving Genetic Stock Identification (GSI), Parentage Based Tagging, intraspecific hybridization/introgression, reproductive success, and selection studies (Campbell et al 2008).  Currently, there are 192 SNP markers (two 96 panel sets) for both steelhead and Chinook salmon that have been selected for use by CRITFC and IDFG for BPA projects involving GSI and PBT in the Columbia River basin.  For PBT broodstock tagging in the Snake River basin, one 96 SNP panel for each species has been optimized to provide sufficient power for parentage tagging (Steele et al 2011).  For GSI, both the 96 PBT SNP panel and a second 96 SNP panel are run for GSI projects. Procedures for running SNPs on the Fluidigm EP1 SNP Genotyping platform are described in method 1332.

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

In addition, because objectsviewed underwater are magnified about 1.3 times, accurately estimatingthe size of fish underwater requires practice.Snorkelers can practice estimating fish sizes byviewing objects and fish of known sizes underwater.Calibrated wooden dowels or floating cutouts of fishof various sizes can be attached to weights and distributedthroughout a stream channel. Snorkelers approach each object andestimate its size. Live fishof known size can also be used. One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size. Another method is to capture fish of severalsize classes and place them in temporary live cages(Rich 1993). Snorkelers independently view each fishand report their results to an instructor."

The RBT allows users to describe and measure river channels using high resolution digital elevation models (DEM).

The interval distance is customizable. For the 2011 CHaMP data the interval distance was 0.5m. Each profile metric comprises several output values: - Mean for all profile values - Standard deviation across all profile values - Coefficient of variation across all profile values - Filtered mean of selected profile values - Filtered standard deviation across selected profile values - Filtered coefficient of variation across all profile values - All profile values along with their cumulative interval distance downstream from the top of the site. The filtered metrics report the same statistics but for a subset of the profile intervals. Filtering removes any values from the population that are more than a set number of standard deviations from the population mean. For CHaMP 2011, this filtering threshold is set at 4 standard deviations. This is intended to exclude outliers from the metrics.

It is designed for arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, dominated by willow and shrub-steppe. This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor the greenline before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation at the greenline.Streamside vegetation and GGW are significant indicators of the levels of incision and riparian health (Burton et al. 2011). Because changes occur most rapidly at the greenline due to high levels of disturbance, greenline vegetation data can be used to make early management decisions (Winward 2000). There are a variety of stream health indicators that can be assessed, using the data metrics collected at the greenline. For example: the presence or absence of deep rooted perennial vegetation can indicate how susceptible the streambank is to erosion; the types of hydrophilic species present can indicate the successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity; the abundance of invasive exotic species found at the greenline (due to high levels of disturbance) can indicate the degree to which the area is susceptible to the establishment of invasive species. Measuring the GGW will provide a more general view into landscape level changes. Over time, changing GGW indicates the degree of sediment aggradation occurring to create a wider stream networks, a key component to improving habitat complexity within and along narrow, incised channels (Pollock et al. 2007) and how quickly this change is occurring.Greenline data measurements are collected in pairs, one on each side of the channel, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1). The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton et al. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008). The measurements taken within the quadrat, in conjunction with information about each quadrats location along the reach, can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization (browse), and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

            "This methodshould be used to determine whether the designed fish passage criteria are met post-construction such that fish passage remains possible. The purpose is to determine whether an engineered solution to a fish passage problem remains viable for at least five years. Natural stream channels provide the benchmark for the passage of all fish for the various life stages at which they migrate. The further a crossing structure (e.g., dam, culvert) departs from the prevailing natural condition, the more impaired fish passage typically becomes. The degree to which the completed passage structure complies with design criteria could measure effectiveness.New stream crossing structures and restoration of fish passage at identified fish passage barriers should utilize design criteria provided through WDFW in the Water Crossing Design Guidelines (Barnard et al. 2013). The methodology in this section will encompass the data necessary to complete evaluations of fish passage structures found inFish Passage Barrier and Surface Water Diversion Screen Assessment and Prioritization(WDFW 2009). These guidelines are based on best available science related to fish passage. In addition to those criteria, the gradient of the fish passage structure will be measured and compared to the original design criteria. Deviations of greater than 20% shall be considered out of compliance.Projects designed and constructed to criteria in the above-referenced guidance documents are presumed to provide fish passage. Therefore, monitoring of project design upon completion of construction and over time constitutes the most appropriate and measurable effectiveness monitoring. Additionally, to assess whether partial fish passage barriers have been improved, it is necessary to evaluate adult and juvenile fish densities to determine whether increased fish utilization has been accomplished."

The thalweg profile is a longitudinal survey of maximum flow path depth and several other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points (termed stations) along the length of the support reach measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from the thalweg profile allows calculation of indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools.

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

The RBT allows users to describe and measure river channels using high resolution digital elevation models (DEM). The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

Snorkelers approach each object andestimate its size. Live fishof known size can also be used. One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size. Another method is to capture fish of severalsize classes and place them in temporary live cages(Rich 1993). Snorkelers independently view each fishand report their results to an instructor."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

Each increment gives a subtotal of the stream discharge, and the whole is calculated as the sum of these parts. Discharge measurements are made at only one carefully chosen channel cross-section. It is important to choose a channel cross-section that is as much like a canal as possible. A glide area with a U-shaped channel cross-section that is free of obstructions provides the best conditions for measuring discharge. You may remove rocks and other obstructions to improve the cross-section before any measurements are made."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

Phytoplantkon abundance and species composition can be controlled by a number of factors, including nutrient availability, temperature, light and grazing pressure. The abundance of phytoplankton is important to lake and fisheries managers, as too little can mean alimited food supply for fish and too much can lead to poor water quality. The composition of the phytoplankton community is equally important. Some taxaare highly nutritious and easily consumed by zooplankton, leading to increased secondary production and potentially clearer water as these taxa are grazed down. Other taxa are not edible, and therefore not controlled by grazing zooplankton, which can lead to nuisance blooms. A few of these taxa can produce toxins, making them a hazard to public health.This method provides details for field collection and preservation of water samples for analysis of phytoplanktonabundance and composition by an outside analytical lab using techniques based on Utermohl 1958."

Discharge measurements are important for assessing trends in streamwater acidity and other characteristics that are very sensitive to streamflow differences.  Stream discharge information is also useful in interpreting the representativeness of water chemistry data and some physical habitat information.  The response design for stream discharge involves a single determination at suitable location within the support reach to characterize conditions at the sampling point.  The location selected should be as close as possible to the location where chemical samples are collected, so that these data correspond.  No single method for measuring discharge is applicable to all types of stream channels.  The preferred procedure is based on velocity-area methods, and provides either the measurement data to calculate discharge or the calculated value for stream discharge.

            "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

The DEMs can be derived from airborne remote sensing, such as LiDAR, or from ground based topographic surveys. With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

Snorkelers approach each object andestimate its size. Live fishof known size can also be used. One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size.

Because GRTS sites are spatially balanced across a given population, visiting sites can be logistically challenging and require careful planning. GRTS surveys can beconducted annually or infrequently depending upon the survey design and objective. Annual sites can target drainages that have juvenile emigrant traps, and as a results snorkelsurveys can be used to calibrate parr densities with production of juvenile emigrants estimated from traps (Copeland et al. 2013). A unique design number provided for all probabilistic sites serves as the site name, with the lowest design numbers having the highest priority for survey.Information on spatial distribution is required for Endangered Species Act (ESA) status reviews (McElhany et al. 2000). And GRTS snorkel surveys canfill this need. In particular, GRTS surveys can beused to establish fish distribution and relative abundance at a larger spatial scale generally sampled within a single year. Although GRTS surveys may span several years if all sites could not be surveyed in a single year. Data collected GRTS surveys often might represent the most complete fish assemblage and distribution information, particularly forremote, and mostly inaccessible basins. Over time GRTS surveys cancoverthe majority of available habitat for steelhead and Chinook Salmon, therebyfilling a large data gap for these species and other salmonids.Occupancy information is useful for programs prioritizing habitat restoration projects for both resident and anadromous fish."

With the RBT you can: - Detrend a DEM to remove the longitudinal valley slope. - Cut user-defined cross sections through the DEM. - Define the hydraulic geometry in each cross section, e.g. the bankfull width/depth. - Compute stream gradient and sinuosity. - Cut long profiles down the length of a channel and map longitudinal variations in any of the channel geometry metrics. - Vary the water level in a detrended DEM to investigate the distribution of water depths inside a stream and the extent of off-channel habitat still hydraulically connected to the main stem flow. - Locate residual pools, which may be used to identify fish habitat. The RBT is an ArcGIS extension and as such you have to have ArcGIS installed before you can use any of the tools in the toolkit.

Recent users of video technology have been working on computer image processing automation (Hatch et al. 1994, 1998) and on recording triggered by motion detection to reduce the number of blank images on tape. Video offers a permanent record of the number of fish and often the species and size that pass an area, and it can be used to compare differences between years and site conditions as well (Hiebert et al. 2000). A permanent record is especially helpful when time constraints do not allow for immediate data analysis (Irvine et al. 1991). Additionally, video can be used to assess populations without any handling of the fish species, reducing potential stress on fish. Finally, video surveys have little impact on the environment and do not cause fish mortality. Video surveys can be used at existing facilities such as dams and fishways but can also be applied in remote locations (see Figure 1).

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

PreliminaryGPPmodel development work by Eco Logical Research, Inc. (ELR) has shown promising results using temperature, solar inputs, and conductivity as model inputs. Solar insolation directly affects stream temperature (Sinokrotand Stefan, 1993) and the primary productivity of streams (Fisher and Likens, 1973; Hill et al., 1995). Work to date has explored using areal solar insolation for the solar input parameter. ELRhasdeveloped a preliminary workflow for predicting solar insolation for a stream network, summarizing the average upstream solar insolation values (watt hours per square meter,WH/m2) per ~200 meters stream segments. South Fork Research, Inc. (SFR) is improving this method and automating the solar insolation modeling process through the development of ArcGIS Python tools. Specifically, we developed a methodology for modeling solar insolation thatemulate the effects of shading from riparian vegetation and topography.The Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program (CHaMP) protocol collects of solar insolation data during stream surveys, however, collecting field-based solar insolation measurements comprehensively (continuously along network) for the entire stream network of the Columbia Basin is resource prohibitive. Developing a spatially-explicit model to predict solar insolation for all stream networks and associated riparian buffers within the Columbia Basin will potentially provide a robust, reliable input forGPPmodeling efforts, and may reduce the need for field-based data collection.To date, our solar modeling efforts have relied on raster data derived from the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset (NBCD) basal area-weighted canopy height dataset. TheNBCDwas developed by the Woods Hole Research Center in 2000, and combines high-resolution inSAR data acquired by the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, and remotely-sensed data from the Landsat ETM+ sensor. The tool then combines basal area-weighted canopy height values with bare-earth topographic values from a National Elevation Dataset (NED) high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM), resulting in a relatively close approximation of stream shading, when calculating solar insolation using ESRIsArea Solar Radiationtool. While we have obtained good results using NBCD basal area-weighted canopy height data, any vegetation height raster dataset (with elevation values in meters) will work as an input for the tool.Model Inputs: NHD+ 1:24k flowlines, segmented NED DEM 10m2 USGS Hydrologic Unit polygon (i.e. HUC4, HUC5) Stream area polygon (i.e. bankfull or NHD Area) NBCDbasal-area weighted (BAW) canopy height"

The CRITFC lab also developed and tested hundreds of additional SNP loci specifically for projects involving Genetic Stock Identification (GSI), Parentage Based Tagging, intraspecific hybridization/introgression, reproductive success, and selection studies (Campbell et al 2008).  Currently, there are 192 SNP markers (two 96 panel sets) for both steelhead and Chinook salmon that have been selected for use by CRITFC and IDFG for BPA projects involving GSI and PBT in the Columbia River basin.

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.  Ensure that data/information from every fish sampled is recorded and tied to a field/hatchery sample number (sample/spawn date, take #, hatchery, sex, length, cross information, etc.) and that field/hatchery sample number is tied to a unique genetic number.

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

            "Discriminant function analysis (DFA)is used to determine which continuous variables discriminate (e.g., differentiate) between two or more groupings. More simply, DFAis useful for determining whether a set of variables is effective in predicting category membership. Discriminant function analysis is the preferred and most commonly used multivariate assignment techniquewhen dealing with isotopic ratio data with the intent of assigning fish to an origin location (Nowling et al. 2011; Gahagan et al. 2012). Discriminant function analysis maintains the following assumptions that should be considered, although this technique is typically robust to slight violations of these assumptions.1) multivariate normality2) homoscedasticity3) non-multicollinearity4) independenceThe following text was paraphrased from Poulsen and French (http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/discrim/discrim.pdf)Discriminant function analysis can be broken into two steps. The first step is testing the significance of a set of discriminant functions. The second step is classification.In the first step there is a matrix of total variances and covariances, and there is also a matrix of pooled within-group variances and covariances. The two matrices are compared via multivariate F tests in order to determine whether or not there are any significant differences (with regard to all variables) between groups. The multivariate test is performed first to determine which of the variables have significantly different means across the groups. Once group means are found to be statistically significant, classification of variables is undertaken. Discriminant function analysis automatically determines some optimal combination of variables so that the first function provides the most overall discrimination between groups, the second provides second most, and so on. Moreover, the functions will be independent or orthogonal, that is, their contributions to the discrimination between groups will not overlap. The first function picks up the most variation; the second function picks up the greatest part of the unexplained variation, etc. Computationally, a canonical correlation analysis is performed that will determine the successive functions and canonical roots. Classification is then possible from the canonical functions. Subjects are classified in the groups in which they had the highest classification scores.

Gill nets are one of the most commonly used gears to collect fish and can be used in a variety of different ways including floating, sinking, suspended, vertical, set, or drifted. Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes. Similarly, a different approach would be to replicate the methods and equipment used by these companies."

In response to predation concerns, actions were taken to evaluate predator reduction strategies and eventually an aggressive predator removal program was implemented in 2006 aimed at collapsing the lake trout population and temporarily reducing the rainbow trout population. A two-pronged approach using both an angler incentive program (AIP) and contract netting (gill nets and trap nets) has been used. Gill netting for mature lake trout can be especially productive during the spawning period. This method describes how we use mobile and stationary telemetry to document lake trout movements and distribution patterns, especially during the spawning period."

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

The CRITFC lab also developed and tested hundreds of additional SNP loci specifically for projects involving Genetic Stock Identification (GSI), Parentage Based Tagging, intraspecific hybridization/introgression, reproductive success, and selection studies (Campbell et al 2008).  Currently, there are 192 SNP markers (two 96 panel sets) for both steelhead and Chinook salmon that have been selected for use by CRITFC and IDFG for BPA projects involving GSI and PBT in the Columbia River basin.  For PBT broodstock tagging in the Snake River basin, one 96 SNP panel for each species has been optimized to provide sufficient power for parentage tagging (Steele et al 2011).  For GSI, both the 96 PBT SNP panel and a second 96 SNP panel are run for GSI projects. Procedures for running SNPs on the Fluidigm EP1 SNP Genotyping platform are described in method 1332.

            "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

            "One of the first tests that geneticists perform on a dataset is to measure whether the genotypes in the sample are present in the expected proportions given the observed allele frequencies.  They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

Geneticists are interested in estimating the level of linkage disequilibrium because it can tell information about both the genetic markers that are being used and the populations being studied.  This includes information about the genetic linkage of markers, selection, the rate of recombination, the rate of mutation, genetic drift, non-random mating, and population structure.When genetic linkage is suspected (a pair of loci exhibit strong LD across multiple populations) often only the one with the highest allele frequency is retained.  If LD is observed between many pairs of loci within the same population, the population may be dropped since many statistical tests assume equilibrium within populations."

            "In the past, we have estimated salmonid abundances using multiple-pass removal depletion methods. Though multipass-depletion estimates are useful for examining site-specific temporal trends, the large degree of within-year variability among site estimates that has commonly been documented in our surveys does not permit a reliable examination of abundance when estimates are expanded to larger spatial scales (Firehammer et al. 2009). Because of this shortcoming and the desire to increase sampling efficiency, an index of site abundance was preferable to an absolute estimate, and was found to track true abundance over time (Firehammer et al. 2011). Others have also found single-pass indices to perform well in predicting abundances for salmonid populations in small-streams (Jones and Stockwell 1995; Kruse et al. 1998; Bateman et al. 2005). More importantly, we found that depletion estimates underestimated the true abundance, primarily as a result of an overestimation of capture probability during subsequent passes, which was consistent with other studies that documented biases associated with depletion-removal estimates for salmonids in small stream systems (Peterson et al. 2004; Rosenberger and Dunham 2005). Results from trend analyses also indicated that first pass catch data provided similar interpretations of watershed-wide abundance trends in salmonids as did our removal-depletion estimates (Firehammer et al. 2011). These results lend support to using first-pass catch rather than multi-pass depletion estimates to examine long-term reach trajectories in our watersheds."

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.  Ensure that all samples come from fresh, live tissue and that each sample is properly preserved until DNA extraction and free of contamination.  Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.

It is designed for arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, dominated by willow and shrub-steppe. This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor the greenline before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation at the greenline.Streamside vegetation and GGW are significant indicators of the levels of incision and riparian health (Burton et al. 2011). Because changes occur most rapidly at the greenline due to high levels of disturbance, greenline vegetation data can be used to make early management decisions (Winward 2000). There are a variety of stream health indicators that can be assessed, using the data metrics collected at the greenline. For example: the presence or absence of deep rooted perennial vegetation can indicate how susceptible the streambank is to erosion; the types of hydrophilic species present can indicate the successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity; the abundance of invasive exotic species found at the greenline (due to high levels of disturbance) can indicate the degree to which the area is susceptible to the establishment of invasive species. Measuring the GGW will provide a more general view into landscape level changes. Over time, changing GGW indicates the degree of sediment aggradation occurring to create a wider stream networks, a key component to improving habitat complexity within and along narrow, incised channels (Pollock et al. 2007) and how quickly this change is occurring.Greenline data measurements are collected in pairs, one on each side of the channel, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1). The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton et al. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008). The measurements taken within the quadrat, in conjunction with information about each quadrats location along the reach, can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization (browse), and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

            "Plankton are small plants or animals that float, drift, or weakly swim in the water column of any body of water. Zooplankton are the animal portion of the planktonand represent the secondary production in a lake or reservoir.The zooplankton can display a high degree of spatial variation, even when considering only the open water (limnetic) region of a lake. This patchiness results from a variety of factors -- including water currents and rapid population growth in locations where phytoplankton biomass is high.There are statistical methods to identify the number of samples required to accurately characterize the zooplankton at a particular time in a lake. This requires preliminary sampling at many locations and some simple statistics. One problem is that if spatial distribution varies markedly over time, the value of this approach may be limited. However, an intensive preliminary study still can provide a context, so that the investigator may provide appropriate caveats when interpreting results of sampling at a lower intensity.In reality, main factors that determine the number of samples are: time, money, objectives of the study, and type of lakes to be sampled. For example, if a study aims to generally characterize the zooplankton of a particular geographic region, and requires sampling of many lakes, it only may be feasible to sample one location in each lake or major basin of larger more complex lakes. In elongated reservoirs, samples typically are collected at several sites along the longitudinal axis, because those lakes have zones with distinct water chemistry, phytoplankton, and zooplankton as one moves from the often turbid upstream end to the algal dominated downstream end.The bottom line is that there is no magic number for how many samples to collect to characterize a lake's zooplankton., but the sampling regime should be grounded in a solid understanding of lake conditions and the questions being asked in the research project.This method describes standard procedures for collecting zooplanktonusingvertical tows."

            "Plankton are small plants or animals that float, drift, or weakly swim in the water column of any body of water. Zooplankton are the animal portion of the planktonand represent the secondary production in a lake or reservoir.The zooplankton can display a high degree of spatial variation, even when considering only the open water (limnetic) region of a lake. This patchiness results from a variety of factors -- including water currents and rapid population growth in locations where phytoplankton biomass is high.There are statistical methods to identify the number of samples required to accurately characterize the zooplankton at a particular time in a lake. This requires preliminary sampling at many locations and some simple statistics. One problem is that if spatial distribution varies markedly over time, the value of this approach may be limited. However, an intensive preliminary study still can provide a context, so that the investigator may provide appropriate caveats when interpreting results of sampling at a lower intensity.In reality, main factors that determine the number of samples are: time, money, objectives of the study, and type of lakes to be sampled. For example, if a study aims to generally characterize the zooplankton of a particular geographic region, and requires sampling of many lakes, it only may be feasible to sample one location in each lake or major basin of larger more complex lakes. In elongated reservoirs, samples typically are collected at several sites along the longitudinal axis, because those lakes have zones with distinct water chemistry, phytoplankton, and zooplankton as one moves from the often turbid upstream end to the algal dominated downstream end.The bottom line is that there is no magic number for how many samples to collect to characterize a lake's zooplankton., but the sampling regime should be grounded in a solid understanding of lake conditions and the questions being asked in the research project.This method describes standard procedures for collecting zooplanktonusingvertical tows."

Phytoplantkon abundance and species composition can be controlled by a number of factors, including nutrient availability, temperature, light and grazing pressure. The abundance of phytoplankton is important to lake and fisheries managers, as too little can mean alimited food supply for fish and too much can lead to poor water quality. The composition of the phytoplankton community is equally important. Some taxaare highly nutritious and easily consumed by zooplankton, leading to increased secondary production and potentially clearer water as these taxa are grazed down. Other taxa are not edible, and therefore not controlled by grazing zooplankton, which can lead to nuisance blooms. A few of these taxa can produce toxins, making them a hazard to public health.This method provides details for field collection and preservation of water samples for analysis of phytoplanktonabundance and composition by an outside analytical lab using techniques based on Utermohl 1958."

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

Within the cone are two tapered flights that are wrapped 360 degrees around a center shaft. The trap cone is oriented with the wide end facing upstream and uses the force of the river acting on the tapered flights to rotate the cone about its axis, similar to an Archimedes screw. Downstream migrating fish are swept into the wide end of the cone (typically either 1.5 m or 2.5 m in diameter) and are gently augured into a live box at the rear of the trap (see Figure 2). A winch is used to adjust the forward elevation of the screw, and an additional winch may be used to raise and lower the aft end of the screw if desired. A small drum screen, powered by the rotating cone or a paddle wheel, may be located at the rear of the live box to remove organic debris. When positioned in the river, screw traps are navigation hazards to boaters, float tubers, and swimmers. Signage should be positioned upstream to instruct river users how to avoid the trap safely. Other protective measures may include installing flashing lights to improve the visibility of the trap and deflectors to help prevent water users and large woody debris from entering the trap (see Figure 3)."

Discharge measurements are important for assessing trends in streamwater acidity and other characteristics that are very sensitive to streamflow differences.  Stream discharge information is also useful in interpreting the representativeness of water chemistry data and some physical habitat information.  The response design for stream discharge involves a single determination at suitable location within the support reach to characterize conditions at the sampling point.  The location selected should be as close as possible to the location where chemical samples are collected, so that these data correspond.  No single method for measuring discharge is applicable to all types of stream channels.  The preferred procedure is based on velocity-area methods, and provides either the measurement data to calculate discharge or the calculated value for stream discharge.  For streams too small or too shallow there are 2 other methods: neutrally bouyant velocity procedure and  timed filling procedure."

            "Plankton are small plants or animals that float, drift, or weakly swim in the water column of any body of water. Zooplankton are the animal portion of the planktonand represent the secondary production in a lake or reservoir.The zooplankton can display a high degree of spatial variation, even when considering only the open water (limnetic) region of a lake. This patchiness results from a variety of factors -- including water currents and rapid population growth in locations where phytoplankton biomass is high.There are statistical methods to identify the number of samples required to accurately characterize the zooplankton at a particular time in a lake. This requires preliminary sampling at many locations and some simple statistics. One problem is that if spatial distribution varies markedly over time, the value of this approach may be limited. However, an intensive preliminary study still can provide a context, so that the investigator may provide appropriate caveats when interpreting results of sampling at a lower intensity.In reality, main factors that determine the number of samples are: time, money, objectives of the study, and type of lakes to be sampled. For example, if a study aims to generally characterize the zooplankton of a particular geographic region, and requires sampling of many lakes, it only may be feasible to sample one location in each lake or major basin of larger more complex lakes. In elongated reservoirs, samples typically are collected at several sites along the longitudinal axis, because those lakes have zones with distinct water chemistry, phytoplankton, and zooplankton as one moves from the often turbid upstream end to the algal dominated downstream end.The bottom line is that there is no magic number for how many samples to collect to characterize a lake's zooplankton., but the sampling regime should be grounded in a solid understanding of lake conditions and the questions being asked in the research project.This method describes standard procedures for collecting zooplanktonusingvertical tows."

Phytoplantkon abundance and species composition can be controlled by a number of factors, including nutrient availability, temperature, light and grazing pressure. The abundance of phytoplankton is important to lake and fisheries managers, as too little can mean alimited food supply for fish and too much can lead to poor water quality. The composition of the phytoplankton community is equally important. Some taxaare highly nutritious and easily consumed by zooplankton, leading to increased secondary production and potentially clearer water as these taxa are grazed down. Other taxa are not edible, and therefore not controlled by grazing zooplankton, which can lead to nuisance blooms. A few of these taxa can produce toxins, making them a hazard to public health.This method provides details for field collection and preservation of water samples for analysis of phytoplanktonabundance and composition by an outside analytical lab using techniques based on Utermohl 1958."

Each increment gives a subtotal of the stream discharge, and the whole is calculated as the sum of these parts. Discharge measurements are made at only one carefully chosen channel cross-section. It is important to choose a channel cross-section that is as much like a canal as possible.

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Tools were created for ArcGIS to conduct several types of analyses associated with DEMs, including geomorphic change detection, uncertainty analyses, user-defined density of cross-sections and longitudinal profiles. These tools can extract hydrologic parameters such as wetted area, bankfull width, water depths, hydraulic radius, gradient, sinuosity (McKean et al. 2009), erosion and depositional patterns and budgets, and uncertainty in the DEM (Wheaton et al. 2010). Using an automated detrending algorithm we are able to remove the overall valley slope. Tools are being created that use the detrended raster to investigate flooding outside a main channel at any prescribed discharge or flow stage. The RBT will also allow users to recreate other survey protocols that use cross-sectional and longitudinal profile approaches.

An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

The thalweg profile is a longitudinal survey of maximum flow path depth and several other selected characteristics at 100 or 150 equally spaced points (termed stations) along the length of the support reach measured along the centerline of the channel. Data from the thalweg profile allows calculation of indices of residual pool volume, stream size, channel complexity, and the relative proportions of habitat types such as riffles and pools. This habitat assessment modifies traditional methods by measuring upstream distance in the middle of the channel, rather than along the thalweg itself (though each thalweg depth measurement is taken at the point of the deepest flow path at each station).Overview: method activities/data collected1.

The use of snorkel surveys for markrecapture estimates provides a calibration factor for the counting efficiency of snorkel surveys as compared to other methods such as electrofishing and seining. For this technique to be used, the system should be closed off with block nets so that the total population observed is constant. For markrecapture estimates, fish need to be collected, marked, and released back to the sample area. Collection occurs with electrofishing, seining, or trapping; marking is done using tags or dyes with color coding or patterns; and release is into the sample reach. Snorkel surveys can then be conducted in the same sample reach to count the number of marked fish. The ratio of the number of fish resighted (i.e., those with marks that are counted) can be used as a calibration factor for the effectiveness of a snorkel survey compared to other survey methods. Fish can be marked differently based on size-class and species recorded by observers, which can help identify those species and size-classes that may have been undercounted using a snorkel survey approach."

Finding a good rock is the most important step to a successful sensor installation. The best rocks are large enough that they often protrude a foot or more above the low flow water surface and wide enough that they can effectively shield the sensor from moving rocks or debris during floods. Ideal site characteristics downstream of large rocks are pockets of relatively calm water with smaller substrate sizes. If large rocks and cobbles are on the downstream side, similarly large substrates are likely to move there again during the next flood and could dislodge the sensor. Finally, the rock should provide a relatively flat downstream attachment surface that is deep enough to remain submerged and in or near flowing water for the entire year. Large substrates suitable for attachment may be relatively rare within low-gradient, meadow reaches, and in these instances, seek steeper channels immediately up or downstream of the meadow.

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.

Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.

When researchers want to compare fish lengths of male spawners versus female spawners or hatchery spawned females versus carcasses, it is a good idea to use this type of length measurement to remove the bias of the eroded tails on female spawners.

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water).

It is designed for arid and semi-arid stream ecosystems, dominated by willow and shrub-steppe. This monitoring procedure may be used on its own to monitor the greenline before and after restoration procedures. However, for our study design purposes, this procedure is also designed to focus on monitoring areas where beaver colonies are present, in order to describe the specific effects of beaver and beaver dams on floodplain vegetation at the greenline.Streamside vegetation and GGW are significant indicators of the levels of incision and riparian health (Burton et al. 2011). Because changes occur most rapidly at the greenline due to high levels of disturbance, greenline vegetation data can be used to make early management decisions (Winward 2000). There are a variety of stream health indicators that can be assessed, using the data metrics collected at the greenline. For example: the presence or absence of deep rooted perennial vegetation can indicate how susceptible the streambank is to erosion; the types of hydrophilic species present can indicate the successful establishment of a wetland community and floodplain connectivity; the abundance of invasive exotic species found at the greenline (due to high levels of disturbance) can indicate the degree to which the area is susceptible to the establishment of invasive species. Measuring the GGW will provide a more general view into landscape level changes. Over time, changing GGW indicates the degree of sediment aggradation occurring to create a wider stream networks, a key component to improving habitat complexity within and along narrow, incised channels (Pollock et al. 2007) and how quickly this change is occurring.Greenline data measurements are collected in pairs, one on each side of the channel, within 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats (Figure 1). The data collection and field procedure are modified from the methodology described in Riparian area management: Multiple indicator monitoring (MIM) of stream channels and streamside vegetation (Burton et al. 2011) and Effectiveness monitoring for streams and riparian areas: sampling protocol for riparian vegetation parameters (PIBO-EM 2008). The measurements taken within the quadrat, in conjunction with information about each quadrats location along the reach, can be used to compare greenline vegetation composition, woody species utilization (browse), and greenline width against varying levels of dam and beaver influence."

Gill nets are one of the most commonly used gears to collect fish and can be used in a variety of different ways including floating, sinking, suspended, vertical, set, or drifted. Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes. Similarly, a different approach would be to replicate the methods and equipment used by these companies."

Typically, trap nets are biased towards capturing larger, more active fish. One benefit to trap nets is they have essentially zero mortality, with the rare exception of a small fish that becomes stuck in the trap mesh. Therefore, trap nets are effective for capturing fish to be used for other purposes (e.g., telemetry, population estimates), and the nets are easily standardized for catch rate trend analyses. Large versions of trap nets have been used in commercial fisheries in the Great Lakes for many years. More details on the use of trap nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

The length measurement of choice will depend on the species of interest. For example, a larval mayfly might have its total length measured whereas a crayfish might just have its carapace length measured. The number of individuals measured will also depend on the final use of the data and the amount of length variability in the population. For example, a sample size of 100 individuals might be adequate for generating a length-weight regression, but a sample size of 500 individuals might be more appropriate for discerning the age structure of a population for which many length bins are used.

            "Fish handling procedures are a critical element of sampling, especially in systems with threatened or endangered species. As researchers and managers, we are obliged to handle the fish we are sampling responsibly (Nickum et al. 2004). This is an important topic that should be considered by all practitioners sampling fish. Detailed fish handing guidelines are available from Nickum et al. 2004, the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) 2005, and Stickney (1983). When markrecapture sampling, it is critical that handled and marked fish return to normal activities before the recapture sample begins to help satisfy the equal catchability assumption associated with markrecapture estimators. There are several examples of things we can do to reduce the handling stress of sampled fish. For instance, minimize sampling at water temperatures above 18 degrees Celsius, use live well colors that mimic the natural environment and included cover, avoid overcrowding fish in live wells, and segregate large predatory fish from small fish to prevent predation in the live well. Also, the zone 0.5 m from an electrofishing anode has been termed the potential zone of injury; thus fish in close proximity to the anode should be quickly removed from it while electrofishing (NMFS 2000). After removal from the water, captured fish should be held for the shortest time possible in live wells with recirculated or aerated water that has approximately the same temperature as the ambient water temperature they were removed from. An innovative live well design used for holding captured stream fish was proposed by Isaak and Hubert (1997) for stream sampling and by Sharber and Carothers (1987) for boat or raft units. Perhaps the most important consideration is to minimize handling of fish during any research or sampling activity."

            "Beach and pole seining can be an efficient method to capture fishes in a wide variety of habitats, including rivers, estuarine, and nearshore lake, reservoir, and marine habitats (Pierce et al. 1990). It is most effective when used in relatively shallow water with few obstructions, where fish are in high concentrations, and for species that are less likely to outswim the net; however, in some circumstances seining can capture highly mobile species such as adult salmon. Seining permits the sampling of relatively large areas in short periods of time as well as the capture and release of fish without significant stress or harm, as long as the bunt of the seine is kept in water and the fish are not too crowded (or fish are quickly moved to a holding container). Cost of gear, boats, and personnel range from relatively inexpensive to modest, depending on the scope and frequency of sampling.Seining may be carried out in a variety of habitat types, depending on the population and life stage of the targeted species. Sites with irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, or dense stands of aquatic vegetation may not be suitable for seining due to net snagging or lifting and reduced fish retention. Current velocity and depth influence site selection and choice of net design. Seines vary in size and design. To help understand what affects selectivity and capture efficiencyand therefore, effectiveness of seiningwe considered the following categories: habitat, water, fish, time of year and day, net, and method. Considering these factors in your study design before you sample and after you begin sampling (by underwater observation and calibration studies) will help you to decide when seining may be a good technique to meet your objectives; it will also help improve the analysis of data collected.Perpendicular set beach seining may be used for fish/area or fish/volume analysis (length, width, and depth must be measured), but fish/set is appropriate only if the distance pulled is consistent. The poles may be marked with 0.1-m-depth increments to facilitate measuring the water depth at the offshore end of the seine (note: take an average of two or more depths). To ensure consistent width of swept area, a rope of known length can be attached to the upper end of each pole (DE in Figure 1) and stretched tight during seining."

            "Previous studies demonstrated that steelhead residuals are a mixture of fish that failed to migrate because they either did not smolt or were maturing males (Sharp et al. 2007). The goal of assessing reproductive status of age 1 or 2 males prior to release from the hatchery is to estimate the proportion of males that may residualize because they are either mature (running) precocious parr or have initiated maturation for spawning a year after release. In the case of summer run steelhead, adults migrate to natal rivers in summer where they reside over winter and spawn the subsequent spring. This suggests that initiation of maturation and the spawning migration in this species must occur roughly a year before the fish will spawn. Identification of precious parr can be done by external examination of body morphology and coloration, and by expression of milt with gentle abdominal pressure. However, males that are in the earliest stages of initiating maturation (spermatogenesis) show no unique external characteristics that can be used to distinguish them from immature males or females. Therefore, we developed methods to quantify a series of morphological and endocrine parameters to estimate proportions of one and two-year old male steelhead that are initiating maturation for the following year. These are measured on lethal subsamples of fish, just prior to release from the hatchery in the spring.We based our selection of parameters on the following information. The onset of spermatogenesis is regulated by the reproductive endocrine axis, which includes hormones and growth factors produced by the brain, pituitary gland and testis. External (e.g. photoperiod, temperature) and internal (e.g. metabolic) cues play important roles in regulating the production of brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which in turn stimulates the production and secretion of gonadotropins (follicle stimulating hormone; FSH and luteinizing hormone, LH) that regulate testicular production of androgens (11-ketotestosterone; 11-KT) and growth factors (antmullerian hormone; AMH and insulin like growth factor 3; IGF3) (Schulz et al. 2010). The activation of the pituitary-testis axis during puberty onset in fish involves increases in synthesis of alpha and beta subunits of FSH and LH (mRNA and protein), increases in plasma levels of FSH and 11-KT, and increases in testis IGF3 mRNA and decreases in AMH mRNA in the testis (Gomez et al. 1999; Campbell et al., 2003; Maugars and Schmitz 2008; Schulz et al. 2010; Tarranger et al. 2010). At the level of the testis, the first cellular indication of onset of spermatogenesis is the rapid proliferation of spermatogonia, which precedes the meiotic divisions of germ cells and development of haploid spermatozoa. The rapid proliferation of germ cells results in small increases in gonadosomatic index (GSI) and cytological changes in germ cells that are observable in histological sections of the testis. Relative levels of mRNAs for pituitary FSH and LH beta subunits and testicular IGF3 and AMH are measured from total RNA using quantitative real time RT PCR (qPCR). Details of laboratory analyses are attached."

They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

This includes information about the genetic linkage of markers, selection, the rate of recombination, the rate of mutation, genetic drift, non-random mating, and population structure.When genetic linkage is suspected (a pair of loci exhibit strong LD across multiple populations) often only the one with the highest allele frequency is retained.

The length measurement of choice will depend on the species of interest. For example, a larval mayfly might have its total length measured whereas a crayfish might just have its carapace length measured. The number of individuals measured will also depend on the final use of the data and the amount of length variability in the population. For example, a sample size of 100 individuals might be adequate for generating a length-weight regression, but a sample size of 500 individuals might be more appropriate for discerning the age structure of a population for which many length bins are used.

            "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

It is important to choose a channel cross-section that is as much like a canal as possible.

            "Today electrofishing is a common and effective fish sampling method used by most fisheries biologists in both lentic and lotic systems (Bohlin et al. 1989; Guy et al. 2009; Miranda and Boxrucker 2009). An energy source (e.g., a generator or battery) is used to electrify metal electrodes that are in the water. The electrical field (AC, DC, or pulsed AC or DC) is used to stun fish or alter their movement in a way that allows them to be captured (Reynolds and Kolz 2012). In the DC field, fish typically turn toward the anode and exhibit electrotaxis (forced swimming);as the fish nears the anode it experiences narcosis (muscle relaxation) and loss of equilibrium (Reynolds 1996). In most cases, it is recommended that pulsed DC be used to reduce injury to fish.Electrofishing is an active gear type of fish collection, and it is an effective tool for characterizing catch-per-unit-effort of both single and multiple species. Boat electrofishing is commonly employed in lakes and reservoirs to determine fish abundance, density, and species composition (Reynolds 1996; Odenkirk and Smith 2005). It has been found to be effective at sampling and characterizing fish communities that reside in the littoral areas of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., electrofishing is less effective at greater depths). If used properly, boat electrofishing results typically do not harm fish (Bohlin et al. 1989). Fish usually return to their normal state in as little as two minutes. Once this happens, and all data have been collected, the fish are returned to the water alive."

            "The purpose of anchor tagging is to mark fish for subsequent recapture. Data from recaptured fish can be used to estimate population abundance, fish growth,and fish movement. Typically, fish must be large enough to accept an anchortag. For example, for a fish like a smallmouth bass, a 150 mm fish can easily accept a40 mmtag. Fish to be tagged may or may not be anesthetized first, and will depend on the species and how quickly they can be handled during the tagging process.Anchor tags are composed of a T-shaped (T-bar) or barbed (dart) attachment end that is embedded in the fish. The other end is a colored plastic tube or streamer that typically has information about the project printed on it (Zale et al. 2012). This method describes attachment of T-bar anchor tags, also known as Floy tags."

            "Because velocity and depth typically vary greatly across a stream, accuracy in field measurements is achieved by measuring the mean velocity and flow cross-sectional area of many increments across a channel (Figure 22). Each increment gives a subtotal of the stream discharge, and the whole is calculated as the sum of these parts. Discharge measurements are made at only one carefully chosen channel cross-section. It is important to choose a channel cross-section that is as much like a canal as possible. A glide area with a U-shaped channel cross-section that is free of obstructions provides the best conditions for measuring discharge. You may remove rocks and other obstructions to improve the cross-section before any measurements are made."

The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream.

Because GRTS sites are spatially balanced across a given population, visiting sites can be logistically challenging and require careful planning. GRTS surveys can beconducted annually or infrequently depending upon the survey design and objective. Annual sites can target drainages that have juvenile emigrant traps, and as a results snorkelsurveys can be used to calibrate parr densities with production of juvenile emigrants estimated from traps (Copeland et al. 2013). A unique design number provided for all probabilistic sites serves as the site name, with the lowest design numbers having the highest priority for survey.Information on spatial distribution is required for Endangered Species Act (ESA) status reviews (McElhany et al. 2000). And GRTS snorkel surveys canfill this need. In particular, GRTS surveys can beused to establish fish distribution and relative abundance at a larger spatial scale generally sampled within a single year. Although GRTS surveys may span several years if all sites could not be surveyed in a single year. Data collected GRTS surveys often might represent the most complete fish assemblage and distribution information, particularly forremote, and mostly inaccessible basins. Over time GRTS surveys cancoverthe majority of available habitat for steelhead and Chinook Salmon, therebyfilling a large data gap for these species and other salmonids.Occupancy information is useful for programs prioritizing habitat restoration projects for both resident and anadromous fish."

(Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). This necessitates quantitative techniques that have a relatively low measurement error, are insensitive to differences in observers, and flow conditions, can occur across all habitats in a reasonable amount of time, and are simple and easy to explain to field personnel.A useful method for quantifying stream morphology and habitat characteristics consists of thalweg, i.e., longitudinal, profiling, which involves surveying the streambed elevation along the deepest portion of the stream (the thalweg), yielding a two-dimensional, longitudinal profile of streambed elevations (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Depressions in the profile represent pools, or deeper habitats, with low velocity during low flow periods, whereas crests in the profile represent riffles (Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles have become a useful tool to assess and monitor fish habitat in wadable streams, in part because thalweg profiles can improve the accuracy and precision of channel and pool measurements (Bauer and Ralph 2001, Mossop and Bradford 2006). Thalweg profiles provide important quantitative measures of stream channel morphology (i.e. stream channel gradient) and fish habitat (i.e. variation in pool depth), while remaining independent of flow conditions (Lisle 1987, Bauer and Ralph 2001, May and Lee 2004, Mossop and Bradford 2006)."

Essentially this technology is very similar to human parentage analyses (i.e. whos the father?). The exceptional advantage PBT has over mechanical tagging technology is increased sample size. By genotyping all parental broodstock, every juvenile is tagged. The key to this technology ultimately working is the ability to sample all (100%) of the hatchery broodstock. 100% broodstock sampling- The primary annual objectives for any hatchery using PBT tagging are to:  Obtain tissue samples (fin clips) from every adult hatchery broodstock that contributes to spawning.

Ensure that every sample is properly labeled and inventoried.

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

            "Variable mesh gill nets are appropriate for sampling when fish mortality is not a limiting factor. Gill nets normally kill a high percentage of fish due to the trapping mechanism of the net around the gills. Careful net tending can reduce but not eliminate the mortality percentage. The use of variable size mesh panels in the gill net allows capture of fish of different sizes. As such, this method can be used to collect data on population abundance, stock characteristics, population distribution, and species richness. Gill nets are not species-selective, and as a result, it can be expected that as many or more nontarget species will be captured as target species. In addition, small aquatic mammals and birds will also occasionally become entangled in the mesh and drown. Gill nets can be used to meet the following objectives:  Determine relative abundance of lake or stream populations by measuring the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE).  Determine total abundance of lake populations by measuring the recapture rate of marked fish.  Determine the length, sex, phenotypes, and genotypes of fish by collecting a representative catch of each sample.  Determine the species composition and relative biomass of a lake or a stream. This method draws extensively from the following papers: Bernabo (1986); Baklwill and Combs (1994); Bonar et al. (2000); and Klemm et al. (1993). Additional insights into use of gill nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

            "One of the first tests that geneticists perform on a dataset is to measure whether the genotypes in the sample are present in the expected proportions given the observed allele frequencies.  They can estimate the expected proportions because of a mathematical concept called the Hardy-Weinberg principle, named after the two scientists who simultaneously discovered it in 1908. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.  Deviations from HWE can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping."

Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water). In these situations, it is more practical to use commercial gill netting companies that are familiar with the process of netting in this way such as those on the Great Lakes.

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

Multiple-pass surveys are conducted in intensively monitored streams and preferred over single-pass surveys because they minimize redd enumeration errors in heavily spawned areas, provide an indication of spawn timing, and generate more carcasses which improve the biological representation of the overall return."

Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

Geneticists are interested in estimating the level of linkage disequilibrium because it can tell information about both the genetic markers that are being used and the populations being studied.  This includes information about the genetic linkage of markers, selection, the rate of recombination, the rate of mutation, genetic drift, non-random mating, and population structure.When genetic linkage is suspected (a pair of loci exhibit strong LD across multiple populations) often only the one with the highest allele frequency is retained.  If LD is observed between many pairs of loci within the same population, the population may be dropped since many statistical tests assume equilibrium within populations."

These characteristics make SNPs ideal for collaboration among agencies involved in genetic studies involving salmon and steelhead throughout the Columbia River basin. SNPs can be genotyped using a variety of methods and instrument platforms. This method describes a technique developed by Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission geneticists (Nate Campbell and Shawn Narum) and was recently published in Molecular Ecology Resources (Campbell et al 2014). The method is called Genotyping-in-Thousands by sequencing (GT-seq) which uses next-generation sequencing of multiplexed PCR products to generate genotypes from relatively small panels (50500) of targeted single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for thousands of individuals in a single Illumina HiSeq DNA sequencer lane. This method uses only unlabelled oligos and PCR master mix in two thermal cycling steps for amplification of targeted SNP loci. During this process, sequencing adapters and dual barcode sequence tags are incorporated into the amplicons enabling thousands of individuals to be pooled into a single sequencing library. Post sequencing, reads from individual samples are split into individual files using their unique combination of barcode sequences. Genotyping is performed with a simple perl script which counts amplicon-specific sequences for each allele, and allele ratios are used to determine the genotypes."

Typically, trap nets are biased towards capturing larger, more active fish. One benefit to trap nets is they have essentially zero mortality, with the rare exception of a small fish that becomes stuck in the trap mesh. Therefore, trap nets are effective for capturing fish to be used for other purposes (e.g., telemetry, population estimates), and the nets are easily standardized for catch rate trend analyses. Large versions of trap nets have been used in commercial fisheries in the Great Lakes for many years. More details on the use of trap nets can be found in Hubert (1996)."

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

An opercle punch was chosen as an appropriate mark in our studies whereby we were estimating abundance of spring spawning salmonids. During the spring, water temperatures are cold enough so that the hole created by the punch would not heal over quickly during the time period prior to recapture (i.e., 2-4 weeks). Thus, the mark would not be lost and it would be recognizable upon recapture. Furthermore, the tool used to create the punch was small so that it was not an intrusive procedure for the fish and the hole it created was not unusually large for the size of trout marked. Therefore, we felt it would not unduly affect the behavior or survivability of the fish."

In lieu of a numeric estimate, fisheries professionals often calculate relative abundance of a fish stock, commonly known as catch-per-unit-effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007). The theory behind using CPUE as a measure of fish abundance is that CPUE will increase with increases in total population size, as it should be representative of the entire population. A primary assumption when using CPUE as an index of relative abundance is that the number of fish captured is proportional to the amount of effort expended (Hubert et al. 2012). There are four additional assumptions that accompany the proper use and interpretation of CPUE:(1)the population is in equilibrium(2) units of effort operate independently from one another(3) catchability is constant throughout the entire sampling period, and(4) every individual in the population has the same probability of capture (Seber 1982)."

Changes in water table elevation and groundwater temperature are anintended result of certain restoration activities (e.g., floodplain reconnection projects) and monitoring these patterns can help provide evidence that restoration work is achieving project goals.This method describes ananalysis procedure for groundwater temperature data, and assumes that data were collected in at least one reference site (which received no manipulations for the purpose of restoration) and one treated site (where restoration activities have occurred). The goal of the analysis is to compare the amplitude and synchronicity of groundwater and surface water temperature cycles in restored and reference areas. Groundwater temperature patterns are expected to more closely align with surface water patterns in areas where groundwater is closer to the land surface (Stonestrom and Constantz, 2003). If such alignment occurs, these data provide corroborating evidence of water table rise and groundwater-surface water exchange (e.g., groundwater recharge from overbank inundation). This is an important goal for some restoration projects.This procedure models seasonal oscillations in groundwater and surface water temperature in order to examine their amplitude and timing and to evaluate how these parameters have changed since restoration. This methodassumes that groundwater data were collected from wells installed as part of a restoration monitoring design and instrumented with Onset HOBOU20Water Level Loggers (U20probes), and that data were collected at a resolution of one reading per hour or two hours for the duration of the monitoring period. Similarly, hourly monitoring data from surface water temperature loggers (e.g., Onset Tidbit v2 or Stowaway XTI loggers) located near the treated and control sites are also prerequisites for this analysis.Analysis of water table elevation data isdiscussed in a separate method."

Tributary overshoot appears to be a common behavior by many Columbia River populations and the proportion of overshoots that do not return downstream to their natal sites can be high. If overshoots do not return to their tributary of origin this will reduce the number of spawning adults for that population. And if overshoots spawn in a non-natal tributary that could negatively impact the receiving populations fitness. Therefore, reliable estimates of overshoot rate and monitoring of adult migration patterns is important for the management and recovery of Columbia River salmon and steelhead populations."

            "Beach and pole seining can be an efficient method to capture fishes in a wide variety of habitats, including rivers, estuarine, and nearshore lake, reservoir, and marine habitats (Pierce et al. 1990). It is most effective when used in relatively shallow water with few obstructions, where fish are in high concentrations, and for species that are less likely to outswim the net; however, in some circumstances seining can capture highly mobile species such as adult salmon. Seining permits the sampling of relatively large areas in short periods of time as well as the capture and release of fish without significant stress or harm, as long as the bunt of the seine is kept in water and the fish are not too crowded (or fish are quickly moved to a holding container). Cost of gear, boats, and personnel range from relatively inexpensive to modest, depending on the scope and frequency of sampling.Seining may be carried out in a variety of habitat types, depending on the population and life stage of the targeted species. Sites with irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, or dense stands of aquatic vegetation may not be suitable for seining due to net snagging or lifting and reduced fish retention. Current velocity and depth influence site selection and choice of net design. Seines vary in size and design. To help understand what affects selectivity and capture efficiencyand therefore, effectiveness of seiningwe considered the following categories: habitat, water, fish, time of year and day, net, and method. Considering these factors in your study design before you sample and after you begin sampling (by underwater observation and calibration studies) will help you to decide when seining may be a good technique to meet your objectives; it will also help improve the analysis of data collected.Perpendicular set beach seining may be used for fish/area or fish/volume analysis (length, width, and depth must be measured), but fish/set is appropriate only if the distance pulled is consistent. The poles may be marked with 0.1-m-depth increments to facilitate measuring the water depth at the offshore end of the seine (note: take an average of two or more depths). To ensure consistent width of swept area, a rope of known length can be attached to the upper end of each pole (DE in Figure 1) and stretched tight during seining."

Therefore, trap nets are effective for capturing fish to be used for other purposes (e.g., telemetry, population estimates), and the nets are easily standardized for catch rate trend analyses.

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that under the assumptions of a large randomly breeding population, with no mutation, gene migration, selection or genetic drift, that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

            "A method to document mortality of juvenile salmonid by birds nesting in the Columbia River estuary is via the recovery of passive integrated transponder (PIT)  tags on bird colonies (Collis et al. 2001, Ryan et al. 2003, Antolos et al. 2005, Evans et al. 2012).  Avian predation rates can then be calculated based on the percentage of PIT-tagged juvenile salmonids released and/or detected passing hydroelectric dams that are subsequently consumed and deposited by birds on their nesting colonies. Because each PIT tag represents a unique fish, the tag recovery approach allows the testing of hypotheses on the effects of smolt morphology, condition, abundance, and origin on smolt vulnerability to avian predation."

            "Beach and pole seining can be an efficient method to capture fishes in a wide variety of habitats, including rivers, estuarine, and nearshore lake, reservoir, and marine habitats (Pierce et al. 1990). It is most effective when used in relatively shallow water with few obstructions, where fish are in high concentrations, and for species that are less likely to outswim the net; however, in some circumstances seining can capture highly mobile species such as adult salmon. Seining permits the sampling of relatively large areas in short periods of time as well as the capture and release of fish without significant stress or harm, as long as the bunt of the seine is kept in water and the fish are not too crowded (or fish are quickly moved to a holding container). Cost of gear, boats, and personnel range from relatively inexpensive to modest, depending on the scope and frequency of sampling.Seining may be carried out in a variety of habitat types, depending on the population and life stage of the targeted species. Sites with irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, or dense stands of aquatic vegetation may not be suitable for seining due to net snagging or lifting and reduced fish retention. Current velocity and depth influence site selection and choice of net design. Seines vary in size and design. To help understand what affects selectivity and capture efficiencyand therefore, effectiveness of seiningwe considered the following categories: habitat, water, fish, time of year and day, net, and method. Considering these factors in your study design before you sample and after you begin sampling (by underwater observation and calibration studies) will help you to decide when seining may be a good technique to meet your objectives; it will also help improve the analysis of data collected.Perpendicular set beach seining may be used for fish/area or fish/volume analysis (length, width, and depth must be measured), but fish/set is appropriate only if the distance pulled is consistent. The poles may be marked with 0.1-m-depth increments to facilitate measuring the water depth at the offshore end of the seine (note: take an average of two or more depths). To ensure consistent width of swept area, a rope of known length can be attached to the upper end of each pole (DE in Figure 1) and stretched tight during seining."

            "Previous studies demonstrated that steelhead residuals are a mixture of fish that failed to migrate because they either did not smolt or were maturing males (Sharp et al. 2007). The goal of assessing reproductive status of age 1 or 2 males prior to release from the hatchery is to estimate the proportion of males that may residualize because they are either mature (running) precocious parr or have initiated maturation for spawning a year after release. In the case of summer run steelhead, adults migrate to natal rivers in summer where they reside over winter and spawn the subsequent spring. This suggests that initiation of maturation and the spawning migration in this species must occur roughly a year before the fish will spawn. Identification of precious parr can be done by external examination of body morphology and coloration, and by expression of milt with gentle abdominal pressure. However, males that are in the earliest stages of initiating maturation (spermatogenesis) show no unique external characteristics that can be used to distinguish them from immature males or females. Therefore, we developed methods to quantify a series of morphological and endocrine parameters to estimate proportions of one and two-year old male steelhead that are initiating maturation for the following year. These are measured on lethal subsamples of fish, just prior to release from the hatchery in the spring.We based our selection of parameters on the following information. The onset of spermatogenesis is regulated by the reproductive endocrine axis, which includes hormones and growth factors produced by the brain, pituitary gland and testis. External (e.g. photoperiod, temperature) and internal (e.g. metabolic) cues play important roles in regulating the production of brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which in turn stimulates the production and secretion of gonadotropins (follicle stimulating hormone; FSH and luteinizing hormone, LH) that regulate testicular production of androgens (11-ketotestosterone; 11-KT) and growth factors (antmullerian hormone; AMH and insulin like growth factor 3; IGF3) (Schulz et al. 2010). The activation of the pituitary-testis axis during puberty onset in fish involves increases in synthesis of alpha and beta subunits of FSH and LH (mRNA and protein), increases in plasma levels of FSH and 11-KT, and increases in testis IGF3 mRNA and decreases in AMH mRNA in the testis (Gomez et al. 1999; Campbell et al., 2003; Maugars and Schmitz 2008; Schulz et al. 2010; Tarranger et al. 2010). At the level of the testis, the first cellular indication of onset of spermatogenesis is the rapid proliferation of spermatogonia, which precedes the meiotic divisions of germ cells and development of haploid spermatozoa. The rapid proliferation of germ cells results in small increases in gonadosomatic index (GSI) and cytological changes in germ cells that are observable in histological sections of the testis. Relative levels of mRNAs for pituitary FSH and LH beta subunits and testicular IGF3 and AMH are measured from total RNA using quantitative real time RT PCR (qPCR). Details of laboratory analyses are attached."

Under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), expected genotype frequencies may be derived from population allele frequencies using the equation p2+2pq+q2 = 1, Where p and q represent the frequencies of alleles.

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

Gill nets are one of the most commonly used gears to collect fish and can be used in a variety of different ways including floating, sinking, suspended, vertical, set, or drifted. Additionally, although gill nets are commonly thought of as having a high mortality rate, especially when set overnight, short soak times and cold water temperatures can reduce mortality rates. However, in some instances gill nets are set in a fashion that makes typical setting or lifting methods impractical (e.g., large quantities of net or deep water).

Avian predation rates can then be calculated based on the percentage of PIT-tagged juvenile salmonids released and/or detected passing hydroelectric dams that are subsequently consumed and deposited by birds on their nesting colonies. Because each PIT tag represents a unique fish, the tag recovery approach allows the testing of hypotheses on the effects of smolt morphology, condition, abundance, and origin on smolt vulnerability to avian predation."

Many topographic surveys are time-limited, thus topographic points and lines must be collected efficiently and strategically to maximize the quality and utility of the DEM. The number of survey points collected is dependent upon the size and complexity of the site. Complex topography should be represented with a higher density of points (approx. 1,000-1,200 points) compared to more simple planar topography (500-600 points). Larger sites may have more points overall but generally have less topographic complexity. Collect survey points at locations that represent changes in slope (inflection points). When capturing streambed topography, avoid capturing elements of bed roughness and instead, focus effort on capturing the bedform of the channel. Extend survey points far enough into the floodplain so that the areal extent of the survey encompasses all qualifying and non-qualifying side channels in areas where lateral migration may occur. Survey points and lines are attributed with a description code (Figure 15) that is used to further represent features in the stream channel. Use the topographic descriptions in Table 7 to identify and code survey points and lines throughout the site. Points: Topographic points are used to capture additional changes in topography that are not captured by lines. Use points to capture non-linear features including general topographic features and channel unit boundaries. Lines: Lines are connections between two or more survey points and are used to efficiently capture visible contours or breaks in the stream channel topography. Lines are best used where there are identifiable linear features that have similar elevations such as the edges of water, and tops and toes of banks. Changes made for 2012: - added water surface (ws) code - added mid-channel island (mw) code - added inflow point (in) code - added outflow point (out) code - added discharge (q) code"

            "In order to determine fish lengths (for adults and juveniles)during underwater activities when it is not feasible to use a measuring board, such as snorkeling,researchers will need to accurately estimate total length. In addition, because objectsviewed underwater are magnified about 1.3 times, accurately estimatingthe size of fish underwater requires practice.Snorkelers can practice estimating fish sizes byviewing objects and fish of known sizes underwater.Calibrated wooden dowels or floating cutouts of fishof various sizes can be attached to weights and distributedthroughout a stream channel. Snorkelers approach each object andestimate its size. Live fishof known size can also be used. One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size. Another method is to capture fish of severalsize classes and place them in temporary live cages(Rich 1993). Snorkelers independently view each fishand report their results to an instructor."

            "Determing snorkel sites utilizinga probabilistic approach, specificallya generalized random-tessellation stratified (GRTS) design (Stevens et al. 2007); results in spatially balanced surveys and allows determination offish abundance at the population scale. Because GRTS sites are spatially balanced across a given population, visiting sites can be logistically challenging and require careful planning. GRTS surveys can beconducted annually or infrequently depending upon the survey design and objective. Annual sites can target drainages that have juvenile emigrant traps, and as a results snorkelsurveys can be used to calibrate parr densities with production of juvenile emigrants estimated from traps (Copeland et al. 2013). A unique design number provided for all probabilistic sites serves as the site name, with the lowest design numbers having the highest priority for survey.Information on spatial distribution is required for Endangered Species Act (ESA) status reviews (McElhany et al. 2000). And GRTS snorkel surveys canfill this need. In particular, GRTS surveys can beused to establish fish distribution and relative abundance at a larger spatial scale generally sampled within a single year. Although GRTS surveys may span several years if all sites could not be surveyed in a single year. Data collected GRTS surveys often might represent the most complete fish assemblage and distribution information, particularly forremote, and mostly inaccessible basins. Over time GRTS surveys cancoverthe majority of available habitat for steelhead and Chinook Salmon, therebyfilling a large data gap for these species and other salmonids.Occupancy information is useful for programs prioritizing habitat restoration projects for both resident and anadromous fish."

The length measurement of choice will depend on the species of interest. For example, a larval mayfly might have its total length measured whereas a crayfish might just have its carapace length measured. The number of individuals measured will also depend on the final use of the data and the amount of length variability in the population. For example, a sample size of 100 individuals might be adequate for generating a length-weight regression, but a sample size of 500 individuals might be more appropriate for discerning the age structure of a population for which many length bins are used. This describes a general method for measuring the length of an invertebrate and should be customized based on the species of interest."

            "A common method used for enumerating salmonids in small streams is based on the multiple removal/depletion technique proposed by Moran (1951) and by Zippin (1958). Under the removal model, the declining catch of fish between multiple electrofishing passes is used to calculate capture efficiencies and abundance estimates. A common protocol requires a section of a stream to be isolated with block nets and a minimum of two removal electrofishing passes to be performed, although three or more removal passes are generally recommended so that catchability assumptions can be statistically tested (White et al. 1982). Practitioners should be aware that the tests used to evaluate equal catchability assumptions generally have low power to detect true differences (Riley and Fausch 1992). The Zippin removal estimator appears sensitive to violations of catchability assumptions (Bohlin and Sundstrom 1977). To circumvent this, Otis et al. (1978) proposed the generalized removal estimator that allows for unequal catchability of fish between removal passes. This estimator requires conducting four or more removal passes; a protocol that could be costly and time consuming. In addition, completion of four removal passes is no guarantee that the resulting removal estimate will be unbiased (Riley and Fausch 1992). The most efficient removal electrofishing protocol will minimize the number of removal passes that must be performed and will maximize the utility of the data. Conducting only two removal passes may satisfy effort requirements but likely produces biased estimates with wide confidence intervals (Riley and Fausch 1992). Additionally, two pass estimates fail when the number of fish captured on the second pass is greater than the number captured on the first electrofishing removal pass. To correct for this, some studies have recommended pooling catch data from multiple sites (Heimbuch et al. 1997). To satisfy effort and utility requirements, Connolly (1996) developed charts for field use based on stringent removal guidelines that produced the most reliable estimates with a minimum number of removal passes. In situations where accurate estimates are not necessary, removal sampling can be a useful method to index abundance. When accurate estimates are necessary, removal estimates should be interpreted with caution unless calibrated with an unbiased estimate, or critical assumptions are tested and validated under field conditions."

            "Beach and pole seining can be an efficient method to capture fishes in a wide variety of habitats, including rivers, estuarine, and nearshore lake, reservoir, and marine habitats (Pierce et al. 1990). It is most effective when used in relatively shallow water with few obstructions, where fish are in high concentrations, and for species that are less likely to outswim the net; however, in some circumstances seining can capture highly mobile species such as adult salmon. Seining permits the sampling of relatively large areas in short periods of time as well as the capture and release of fish without significant stress or harm, as long as the bunt of the seine is kept in water and the fish are not too crowded (or fish are quickly moved to a holding container). Cost of gear, boats, and personnel range from relatively inexpensive to modest, depending on the scope and frequency of sampling.Seining may be carried out in a variety of habitat types, depending on the population and life stage of the targeted species. Sites with irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, or dense stands of aquatic vegetation may not be suitable for seining due to net snagging or lifting and reduced fish retention. Current velocity and depth influence site selection and choice of net design. Seines vary in size and design. To help understand what affects selectivity and capture efficiencyand therefore, effectiveness of seiningwe considered the following categories: habitat, water, fish, time of year and day, net, and method. Considering these factors in your study design before you sample and after you begin sampling (by underwater observation and calibration studies) will help you to decide when seining may be a good technique to meet your objectives; it will also help improve the analysis of data collected.Perpendicular set beach seining may be used for fish/area or fish/volume analysis (length, width, and depth must be measured), but fish/set is appropriate only if the distance pulled is consistent. The poles may be marked with 0.1-m-depth increments to facilitate measuring the water depth at the offshore end of the seine (note: take an average of two or more depths). To ensure consistent width of swept area, a rope of known length can be attached to the upper end of each pole (DE in Figure 1) and stretched tight during seining."

One method is to individuallymark fish of known sizes in a stream reach.Snorkelers approach each marked fish and estimateits size. Another method is to capture fish of severalsize classes and place them in temporary live cages(Rich 1993). Snorkelers independently view each fishand report their results to an instructor."

This capture method, particularly when done in waters closed to public angling, requires close coordination with local law enforcement and heightened public outreach."

            "Estimate occupancy to describe spatial structure of anadromous parr from snorkel surveys. v1.0",
            "Determing snorkel sites utilizinga probabilistic approach, specificallya generalized random-tessellation stratified (GRTS) design (Stevens et al. 2007); results in spatially balanced surveys and allows determination offish abundance at the population scale. Because GRTS sites are spatially balanced across a given population, visiting sites can be logistically challenging and require careful planning. GRTS surveys can beconducted annually or infrequently depending upon the survey design and objective. Annual sites can target drainages that have juvenile emigrant traps, and as a results snorkelsurveys can be used to calibrate parr densities with production of juvenile emigrants estimated from traps (Copeland et al. 2013). A unique design number provided for all probabilistic sites serves as the site name, with the lowest design numbers having the highest priority for survey.Information on spatial distribution is required for Endangered Species Act (ESA) status reviews (McElhany et al. 2000). And GRTS snorkel surveys canfill this need. In particular, GRTS surveys can beused to establish fish distribution and relative abundance at a larger spatial scale generally sampled within a single year. Although GRTS surveys may span several years if all sites could not be surveyed in a single year. Data collected GRTS surveys often might represent the most complete fish assemblage and distribution information, particularly forremote, and mostly inaccessible basins. Over time GRTS surveys cancoverthe majority of available habitat for steelhead and Chinook Salmon, therebyfilling a large data gap for these species and other salmonids.Occupancy information is useful for programs prioritizing habitat restoration projects for both resident and anadromous fish."

            "Naturally established versus manipulated wetland basin seed biomass survey v1.0",
            "Moist soil management is a valuable tool for the treatment of wetland habitats and the wildlife species associated with wetlands. The ability to manage water levels, create disturbance, and manipulate vegetation to allow for more productive early successionalwetland habitats is crucial to the TD-1 project. Moist soil management provides critical habitat and food sources for wetland obligate and wetland associated species, while also allowing for valuable recreation opportunities. Through this survey effort we will be inspecting four different techniques used in 5 wetland cells. Cell 1 was left to naturally establish, Cell 2 was harrowed and then Wild Millet was broadcast seeded, Cell 3 was tilled, Cell 4 was harrowed and Wild Millet was drill seeded, and Cell 7 which was tilled. During the end of May 2018 Wetland Specialist McPherson started harrowing wetland cells 2 and 4. Cell 2 was broadcast seeded with Wild Millet beginning June 1, seed was broadcasted at rate of 30lbs per acre.Cell 4 seeding started June 6, seed in this basin was drilled at rate of 25lbs per acre. This was the first year the wildlife area had new drill seeder that could be hauled behind ATV, making it easier to work in wetland basins. Specialist McPherson wanted to evaluate what method of planting would yield higher rate of seed biomass.Both cells 3 and 7 were tilled to set back non desirable vegetation and to turn over soil to aid soil health and help future plantings of desirable waterfowl forage. Tillage started July 11, when Specialist McPherson had returned to cells for second round of heavy tillage in Late August, good volunteer stands of Wild Millet had established. Given the opportunity Specialist McPherson wanted to evaluate the seed biomass present in a volunteer stand of Wild Millet and how that compared to broadcast and drill seeding. The Millet that established voluntarily was stored in the seed bank from prior years plantings."
