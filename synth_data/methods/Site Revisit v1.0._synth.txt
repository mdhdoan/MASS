2. Abstract: The text describes a method used for relocating previously sampled sites. This involves providing crews with various resources such as driving and hiking directions, site maps, topographic survey maps, scout notes and maps, site photographs, and UTM coordinates for monuments, benchmarks, site markers, and temperature loggers.
3. Description: The method for relocating previously sampled sites involves the use of several resources. Driving and hiking directions are provided to help crews physically locate the sites. Site maps give crews an overview of the area and can help them identify key landmarks or features. Topographic survey maps provide more detailed information about the terrain, including elevation changes. Scout notes and maps, if available, can provide additional context and insights into the site. Site photographs can be used for visual identification and to cross-reference with current conditions. UTM coordinates are provided for monuments, benchmarks, site markers, and temperature loggers to allow for precise location mapping and tracking.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to accurately relocate previously sampled sites for further study or monitoring.
5. Constraints: Some potential constraints for this method include the availability and accuracy of previous scout notes and maps, the condition of site markers and monuments, and any changes to the terrain or environment that may have occurred since the site was last sampled.
