 1. Abstract: The Yakima/Klickitat Fisheries Project (YKFP) is a large-scale fisheries management initiative aimed at increasing natural production of targeted fish populations while maintaining genetic diversity and minimizing adverse ecological impacts. The project's genetic monitoring program utilizes SNP panels to collect and process samples from juvenile and adult spring Chinook salmon, enabling population of origin assignment and whole river pedigree analysis.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: Values include conservation of natural resources, sustainable fisheries management, and responsible use of hatchery supplementation. The problem statement addresses the need to balance artificial production with long-term genetic fitness and minimal ecological disruption. Desired outcomes include increased understanding of fish population dynamics, informed decision-making for fisheries management, and effective conservation of native fish species.
3. Description: The YKFP genetic monitoring program involves collecting genetic samples from returning adult spring Chinook salmon and juvenile smolt migrants at specific facilities. Samples are processed using SNP panels in the WDFW Molecular Genetics Laboratory, with genetic assignments forwarded to CRITFC for whole river parentage analysis and population of origin determination. These processes enable the estimation of reproductive success differences between hatchery and wild chinook and the partitioning of basin-wide smolt production by population.
4. Objectives: The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of hatchery supplementation in increasing natural production while maintaining genetic diversity and minimizing adverse ecological impacts. This objective covers the entire problem statement. Keywords include YKFP, SNP panels, genetic monitoring, whole river pedigree analysis, and population of origin assignment.
5. Target: The primary focus is to evaluate and optimize the YKFP's hatchery supplementation strategy through comprehensive genetic monitoring and analysis.
6. Constraints: Constraints for the current protocol include ensuring adequate sample sizes, maintaining accurate and up-to-date genetic databases, addressing potential biases in genetic assignments, and coordinating efforts among various agencies and stakeholders involved in the YKFP.
