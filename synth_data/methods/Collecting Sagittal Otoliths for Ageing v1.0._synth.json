  "abstract": " The method described in the text refers to determining the age of fish using their otoliths, specifically the largest pair called sagittal otoliths. Otoliths are small calcified structures located in the inner ear of fish that grow incrementally with the addition of new layers each year. Ageing fish by examining these structures is more reliable than other methods like counting growth rings on scales, as the growth patterns in otoliths are less affected by external factors. The process involves carefully extracting the sagittal otoliths from the fish and analyzing their structure under a microscope to count the number of growth bands or layers which represent the fish's age. This method is crucial for understanding the growth patterns, population dynamics, and management of various fish species."

  "description": " In the field of fish age determination, various structures have been employed to estimate the age of specimens, with otoliths being the preferred choice for older fish. Otoliths are small calcified structures located within the inner ear of fish, and the largest pair, known as sagittal otoliths, is most frequently utilized for age assessment.\n\nThe process of acquiring sagittal otoliths from fish earmarked for age and growth analysis involves several steps. Firstly, the fish is humanely euthanized using accepted methods appropriate for the species in question. Once deceased, the head region is carefully excised, preserving the surrounding soft tissues to ensure the integrity of the otoliths.\n\nThe operculum, a flat bone located at the gill cover, is then removed, providing access to the skull cavity and the otoliths housed within it. Using appropriate tools, such as a small chisel or a scalpel, the skull vault is carefully dissected to expose the sagittal otoliths.\n\nThese structures, resembling tiny conch-like discs, are removed with great care, being delicate and susceptible to damage. Once extracted, the otoliths are thoroughly cleaned using demineralized water or a mild detergent solution, followed by rinsing with clean water. They are then left to dry naturally before being mounted onto microscope slides for further analysis.\n\nThe age of the fish is determined by counting growth bands, which are formed through the incremental addition of calcium carbonate in the otoliths during each year of the fish's life. The number and size of these bands offer valuable insights into the fish's growth history and overall condition, contributing to a better understanding of population dynamics, health, and potential management strategies for fisheries."
