2. Abstract: High-density genome-wide DNA sequencing is a powerful tool for identifying genetic markers used in Parentage Based Tagging and Genetic Stock Identification projects. It also helps in detecting genes under selection, which can be crucial in predicting potential adaptations to climate change. However, whole-genome sequencing of multiple individuals remains expensive. A cost-effective alternative is Pool-Seq, where DNA from multiple individuals is homogenized and sequenced together, providing a representation of allele frequencies at a fraction of the individual sequencing cost.

3. Description: The text discusses the benefits of high-density genome-wide DNA sequencing in uncovering genetic markers for Parentage Based Tagging and Genetic Stock Identification projects. Furthermore, it highlights the use of this sequencing method to identify genes under selection, using the example of Oncorhynchus mykiss under thermal stress as an indicator for climate change adaptability. The major constraint lies in the high costs associated with whole-genome sequencing of multiple individuals. To address this, recent methods involve DNA pooling (Pool-Seq) to determine allele frequencies at a reduced cost. This approach provides a cost-effective representation of population genetics without sacrificing valuable genetic information.

4. Target: The primary focus is to demonstrate the benefits and capabilities of Pool-Seq as a cost-effective alternative to whole-genome sequencing for population genetics research.

5. Constraints: The main constraint for this method is the associated costs with whole-genome sequencing, which remains a significant hurdle in genetic research involving multiple individuals. Pool-Seq offers a solution by reducing costs through DNA pooling and sequencing homogenized samples, thereby providing a representation of allele frequencies at a population level.
