  "abstractText": "After qualitative surveys of a river reach have identified the presence of freshwater mussels, estimates of the number of animals in a bed and other population estimates can be made by counting individual animals in quarter meter square quadrats.Qualitative estimates of the mussel 'bed' or areas of presence, low, and high densities should be delineated prior to planning of quantitative measures. Visual surveys should also determine which mussel species are present in the river reach, and individual quadrat counts should inlude notes by species. Personnel should be able to identify species (or to genus for Anodonta species) by visible shell characteristics or by inhalent aperture papillae without causing excessive disturbance to the mussel bed.",
