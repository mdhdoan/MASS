2. Abstract: This method focuses on calculating reach width, which is essential for understanding the size and capacity of a waterway or floodplain. By taking an average of five bankfull width measurements during site layout, a more accurate representation of the reach length can be determined. The methodology for measuring bankfull widths is outlined in AEM Site Layout #1 v1.0, ensuring standardization and consistency in data collection.
3. Description: The text describes a technique for calculating reach width based on the average bankfull width measured at five locations within the site layout. This process helps determine the reach length for waterway or floodplain assessment purposes. The methodology for measuring bankfull width is detailed in AEM Site Layout #1 v1.0 (ID:4073), ensuring that data collection follows a consistent and standardized procedure.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to determine the reach width by averaging bankfull width measurements taken during site layout.
5. Constraints: This method requires access to the waterway or floodplain for direct measurement of bankfull widths at five locations within the reach length. Additionally, adherence to the specific measurement methodology outlined in AEM Site Layout #1 v1.0 (ID:4073) is necessary for consistent and accurate data collection.
