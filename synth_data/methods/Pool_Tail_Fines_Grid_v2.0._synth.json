  "abstract": " This text is about quantifying the percentage of two different sizes of surface substrate - those that are less than 2 millimeters (mm) and those that are between 2-6 mm - at the tails of pools and non-turbulent channel units.\n\nMethod Overview:\nThe method involves measuring and categorizing the size of surface substrate particles at specific locations, in this case, at the tails of pools and non-turbulent channel units. The substrate is typically collected through various methods such as dredging or grab sampling and then sieved to separate particles based on size. The percentages are then calculated for each size category.\n\nThis analysis is necessary in studying aquatic environments, particularly in assessing habitat quality and biodiversity. Knowing the distribution of different substrate sizes can provide insights into organism populations and their behaviors, as well as influence water flow patterns and sediment transport processes. By quantifying these percentages, researchers and environmental managers can make informed decisions on restoration or mitigation efforts, and monitor changes over time.\n\nHere's a simple Python code snippet for calculating the percentages of different substrate sizes given a list of sizes:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_percentages(substrate_sizes):\n    total = sum(substrate_sizes)\n    percentage_less_than_2mm = len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 2, substrate_sizes))) / total * 100\n    percentage_between_2_6mm = len(list(filter(lambda x: 2 <= x <= 6, substrate_sizes))) / total * 100\n    return percentage_less_than_2mm, percentage_between_2_6mm\n```"

  "description": " This text pertains to quantifying the percentage distribution of surface substrate sizes at the tails of pools and non-turbulent channel units. The substrate sizes under consideration are those below 2 mm and those ranging between 2-6 mm.\n\nTo accomplish this task, one would follow a standard procedure for measuring and categorizing substrate size distributions:\n\n1. Carefully observe and measure the length of the pool tails and non-turbulent channel units where substrate sampling will occur.\n2. Gently collect representative surface samples from each location using appropriate tools (e.g., spatula, dredge, or hand net).\n3. Dry each sample and subsequently sieve them through different mesh sizes: one for the substrate < 2 mm, and another for the substrate between 2-6 mm.\n4. Weigh the respective samples, either before or after drying, to obtain their masses.\n5. Calculate the percentage of total surface substrate that falls within each size range by dividing the weight of each sample by the combined weight of all samples and multiplying by 100%.\n\nUsing a programming language like Python, you could write a script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Sample weights in grams\nweight_substrate_below2mm = 5.6\nweight_substrate_between2to6mm = 7.8\ntotal_weight = weight_substrate_below2mm + weight_substrate_between2to6mm\n\npercentage_substrate_below2mm = (weight_substrate_below2mm / total_weight) * 100\npercentage_substrate_between2to6mm = (weight_substrate_between2to6mm / total_weight) * 100\n\nprint(\"Percentage of substrate below 2 mm: {:.2f}%\".format(percentage_substrate_below2mm))\nprint(\"Percentage of substrate between 2-6 mm: {:.2f}%\".format(percentage_substrate_between2to6mm))\n```"

  "constraints": " Based on the given text, there are no specific constraints mentioned regarding the method for quantifying the percentage of surface substrate <2 mm and between 2-6 mm at pool tails and non-turbulent channel units. However, the text does suggest that the measurement is being taken at those specific locations in pools and non-turbulent channel units. If a particular method or technique is to be used to make these measurements, it would need to be specified separately.\n\nTherefore, no constraint-related information can be extracted from the given text."
