2. Abstract: The use of video technology has been proven to be an effective and efficient method for recording fish passage, providing high-quality, permanent records at a lower cost than direct observation or weirs. This non-invasive technique reduces staff fatigue and stress on fish species, allowing for specimen identification, development of confidence bounds on escapement estimates, and comparison of data between years and site conditions. Recent advancements in computer image processing automation and motion detection technology have further increased the efficiency of video surveys.
3. Description: Video equipment offers a time-efficient and non-invasive method for creating high-quality records of fish passage at relatively low costs (Hatch et al. 1994). This is achieved through adequate lighting and the collection of data at less cost than direct observation or weirs. Video also creates a permanent record of observations, allowing for specimen identification and reanalysis if necessary (Hatch et al. 1994). Recent developments in technology have led to computer image processing automation and motion detection recording, reducing staff fatigue and the number of blank images on tape (Hatch et al. 1994, 1998; Otis and Dickson 2002). Video surveys can determine species composition, numbers of hatchery versus wild fish, body sizes of moving or migrating fish, spawner and redd density, distribution, and habitat characteristics, as well as behavioral aspects of fish (Hatch et al. 1994). These surveys can be applied in various locations, including remote areas with the use of lightweight, transportable systems running on alternative power sources (Otis and Dickson 2002). Time savings vary by application, with studies showing a reduction of up to 97.9% in staff time needed for results (Hatch et al. 1994; Otis and Dickson 2002).
4. Target: The primary goal of video surveys is to provide an efficient and non-invasive method for recording fish passage, determining species composition, and assessing various aspects of fish populations, including behavioral characteristics.
5. Constraints: While video surveys offer many benefits, they do require adequate lighting, technology for image processing automation and motion detection, and potentially additional equipment for remote application. Time savings may vary depending on the application and level of technology used.
