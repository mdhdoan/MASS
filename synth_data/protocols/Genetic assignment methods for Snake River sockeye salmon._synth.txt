 Sure, I'd be happy to help label the topics and provide the requested information. Here are the keywords that summarize the main topics and themes covered in the text body:

1. Parentage Based Tagging (PBT)
2. Genetic Stock Identification (GSI)
3. Snake River sockeye salmon
4. Oncorhynchus nerka life history composition
5. Hatchery release strategies

Now, let's break down the text body into the requested sections:

1. Abstract: The protocol describes how Parentage Based Tagging (PBT) and Genetic Stock Identification (GSI) are used to monitor Snake River sockeye salmon life history composition and evaluate hatchery release strategies. These genetic assignment techniques are critical components of the captive broodstock program's monitoring and evaluation efforts.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes:
	* Values: The importance of preserving Snake River sockeye salmon populations and understanding their life history composition to inform conservation efforts.
	* Problem Statement: There is a need for effective methods to monitor the life history composition of Snake River sockeye salmon and evaluate hatchery release strategies.
	* Desired outcomes: The implementation of PBT and GSI will enable better monitoring and evaluation of the captive broodstock program's efforts, leading to more informed conservation decisions.
3. Description: The text provides a detailed description of how PBT and GSI are implemented in Snake River sockeye salmon. The protocol outlines the methods used for genetic tagging and assignment, including the use of microsatellite DNA markers. It also discusses the challenges associated with assigning immature individuals to life history types based on their genotype. The text includes references to specific studies and protocols, such as Winans et al. (1996).
4. Objectives:
	* Objective: To describe how PBT and GSI are implemented in Snake River sockeye salmon.
	* Summary of Solution Coverage: The objective covers the entire problem statement by providing a comprehensive solution for monitoring and evaluating the life history composition of Snake River sockeye salmon and hatchery release strategies.
	* Keywords: Parentage Based Tagging, Genetic Stock Identification, microsatellite DNA markers, genetic tagging, assignment methods.
5. Target: The primary focus of the protocol is to describe how PBT and GSI are used in Snake River sockeye salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts.
6. Constraints: One constraint for the current protocol is the need for specialized equipment and expertise in genetics and molecular biology to perform PBT and GSI. Additionally, there may be limitations to the accuracy of genetic assignment methods, particularly when assigning immature individuals to life history types based on their genotype.
