  "abstractText": "This site layout method covers locating the site, establishing site markers, determining bankfull elevation and site width category, laying out the site and determining channel units. This layout uses a similar strategy to the layout described in Peck et al (2003) which uses transects labeled A through K, corresponding with the odd numbered transects in the CHaMP (2013) site layout protocols described below (i.e. Transect A = Transect 1 and Transect C = Transect 5).This method is based off of Site Layout v2.0 (Method 1579) but does not include benchmarks or monuments.",
