  "background": "Mysids were introduced to Lake Pend Oreille in 1966 to improve kokanee growth rates, but mysids did not benefit kokanee. Competitive interactions with mysids were a concern following their establishment (Rieman and Falter 1981), but subsequent research suggested that competition with mysids did not limit the kokanee population (Maiolie and Elam 1993; Clarke and Bennett 2002a; Clarke and Bennett 2002b; Maiolie et al. 2002). However, competition may become limiting as kokanee abundance increases towards recovery goals (Maiolie et al. 2002). In contrast to other research, one study suggested that delayed onset of cladocerans following mysid introduction reduced survival of hatchery kokanee fry (Paragamian and Bowles 1995). A different mechanism by which mysids may (at some threshold level) limit kokanee abundance is altered nutrient dynamics (Chipps and Bennett 2000; Wilhelm and Caldwell 2011). Similarly, changes in lake productivity are not fully understood and may influence kokanee recovery. We have used a standardized approach to monitor mysid abundance since 1995 with historic trend data back to 1973. We plan to continue to evaluate mysid abundance given their potential to affect kokanee recovery.",
