  "abstractText": "This document is the Environmental Assessment Program (EAP), Environmental Monitoring and Trends Section, Freshwater Monitoring Unit (FMU), Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the field collection and analysis of conductivity samples. In addition, this method covers the Direct In-Situ Method (Section 6.2.4) used in wadeable streams for Total Maximum Daily Load and other special studies.The procedures cover meter calibration, sample collection, sample measurement, and quality assurance/quality control. The conductivity meter sample measurement methods follow those described in Standard Methods 2510 B (APHA, 2005).This SOP is intended for freshwater monitoring. Marine waters measurements or samples should be taken as specified in a Quality Assurance project Plan.",
