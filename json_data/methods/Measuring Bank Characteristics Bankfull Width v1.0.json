  "abstractText": "Characteristics to Identify Bankfull width:Bankfull flows are large enough to erode the stream bottom and banks, but frequent enough (every one to two years) to prevent substantial growth of upland terrestrial vegetation. Consequently, in many regions, it is these flows that have determined the width and depth of the channel. An obvious slope break that differentiates the channel from a relatively flat floodplain terrace higher than the channel. A transition from exposed stream sediments to terrestrial vegetation. Moss growth on rocks along the banks. Presence of drift material caught on overhanging vegetation. A transition from flood and scour tolerant vegetation to that which is relatively intolerant of these conditions.",
