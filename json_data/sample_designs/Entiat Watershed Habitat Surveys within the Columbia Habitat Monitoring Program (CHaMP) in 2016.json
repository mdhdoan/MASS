  "description": "<p>CHaMP&nbsp;is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010).&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;salmonids&nbsp;and/or their habitat. The implementation of&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;56.3,&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;57, and&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;3.&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel (see section 1.6), at least 9 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHaMP&rsquo;s&nbsp;&nbsp;Entiat&nbsp;habitat monitoring program covers two distinct spatial domains with two different sampling designs.&nbsp; The lower&nbsp;mainstem&nbsp;Entiat&nbsp;is part of the&nbsp;Entiat&nbsp;Intensively Monitored Watershed (IMW) over which substantial amount of habitat restoration has occurred or is planned for future years.&nbsp; The&nbsp;IMW&nbsp;design is aimed specifically at evaluating the in-stream restoration actions using a hierarchical staircase design. The second design covers the upstream&nbsp;mainstem&nbsp;Entiat, tributaries to the&nbsp;Entiat, and the main tributary, Mad River with a standard&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;status and trends design. &nbsp;The combination of the two survey designs cover the spatial domain of the&nbsp;Entiat&nbsp;Steelhead population (Steelhead (Upper Columbia River&nbsp;DPS) -&nbsp;Entiat&nbsp;River) and&nbsp;Entiat&nbsp;Chinook population (Chinook Salmon (Upper Columbia River Spring-run&nbsp;ESU) -&nbsp;Entiat&nbsp;River).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2016: Design updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were no design updates in 2016. &nbsp;There was one Extra site sampled in 2016 (CBW 138667 to replace CBW&nbsp;269739) and this triggered a new design in 2016 (1/23/17)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2015 Design updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All core&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;designs were updated to accommodate effort that will go towards the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://isemp.egnyte.com/dl/EcV8YyGyV5\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">10% repeat design for&nbsp;CHaMP</a>. &nbsp; The design update will result in 3 annual sites from the active design (e.g. 2014) and move one to each rotating panel. &nbsp;This will result in a net freeing of 2 visits each year that can be used to revisit 2 sites. &nbsp;This change preserves the annual sites within the design and adjusts the frequency of sampling. &nbsp;2 sites slated for sampling in the current year (e.g. 2015) will be randomly selected for repeat sampling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Entiat:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200bCBW05583-354987, Depositional-Public, will be moved to RP2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-043691, Depositional-Public, will be moved to RP1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-0241323, Source Public, will be moved to RP3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2014 Sample Design changes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, the Entiat frame was reviewed and refined to more closely align with Steelhead distribution based on field data and Streamnet distributions. &nbsp;Terraqua provided guidance and approval of frame revision. &nbsp;Although strata remained the same, site allocation to panels was shifted to accurately represent the new frame. &nbsp;Site allocation was revised as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200b10 annual sites and 8 rotating panel sites sampled each year, with a balance of 66% sites in Depositional (public or private) and 34% of sites in Source or Transport (public or private). &nbsp;After 3 years, almost all of the master sample sites available in the frame will be sampled at least once. &nbsp;Sites evaluated in 2011-2013 that are within the current 2014 frame but were rejected for frame reasons were INCLUDED in this design, with the assumption that non-target evaluations from previous years will be carried into 2014. &nbsp;The 2011 Entiat&nbsp;IMW overlap area has been excluded from the 2014 frame (no S&amp;T in this area, just IMW monitoring). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This design covers 2014-2016, and each block contains at least enough samples to cover planned sampling. &nbsp;If site rejections occur, all blocks will utilize the &#39;Extra&#39; sites available for use in any panel. &nbsp;All oversample sites beyond planned sampling needs were moved to the Extra blocks and use order was reset to the original 2011 use order of these sites by Valley Class-Ownership stratification (panels ignored in use order). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following sites were excluded from the frame with the frame adjustments: CBW05583-358059, CBW05583-415403, CBW05583-259499</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2013 Sample Design changes</strong>: In 2013, &nbsp;3 sites were added to the&nbsp;Entiat&nbsp;IMW&nbsp;but did not affect the&nbsp;GRTS&nbsp;sample design for the&nbsp;Entiat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2012 Sample Design changes</strong>:&nbsp; Three factors contributed to the 2012 design changes: 1) in 2011,&nbsp;Terraqua&nbsp;sampled 18 sites in the&nbsp;Entiat&nbsp;instead of the previously planned 25 sites due to a reduced budget;&nbsp; 2) the&nbsp;Entiat&nbsp;sampling frame contained a large number of non-target sites due to barriers discovered during the site evaluation process; and 3) &nbsp;a short section of the Mad River was included in both the status and trend and&nbsp;IMW&nbsp;frames. The culmination of these adjustments left several blocks low in available sites, specifically the transport and&nbsp;depositional- private strata.&nbsp; Additional&nbsp;oversample&nbsp;sites were added to champmonitoring.org to supplement these blocks. If not enough sites were available for evaluation/sampling in any block, sampling was directed to blocks that have a &#39;large&#39; pool of sites of the same valley class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Depositional-private&nbsp;strata:</strong>&nbsp;There were only three in the&nbsp;CBW&nbsp;master sample, two of which were&nbsp;IMW, leaving only one&nbsp;depositional-private&nbsp;site in the master pool.&nbsp; The one&nbsp;depositional-private&nbsp;site was listed as a site to be sampled.&nbsp; If it is rejected, the effort should be moved to the&nbsp;depositional-public&nbsp;strata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Transport Strata:</strong>&nbsp;Site rejections in 2011 left no additional transport sites for 2012 sampling. The master sample had a pool of only 8 sites, 7 of which were rejected because they were above a barrier.&nbsp; The one below a barrier is an annual site that was sampled, which should be kept in the design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To resolve the&nbsp;Entiat&nbsp;IMW&nbsp;overlap, the status and trend sites within the Mad River that overlapped with the&nbsp;IMW&nbsp;were not sampled in 2012 and the decision was made to include the overlapping section in the&nbsp;IMW&nbsp;rather than the status and trends sampling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2011 Sample Design Summary</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The finadd.str.pnl.r function was applied to each stratum separately to generate a spatially balanced ordered site list with legacy sites at the top of the Use Order. A modified standard&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;design of 25 sites per year was used, including 18 annual and 7 sites to each rotating panel (3 rotating panels on a 3 year rotating cycle). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GRTS&nbsp;final design</strong>:&nbsp;Entiat&nbsp;Design 7.25.2011.csv\u200b</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>R code:</strong>&nbsp;Entiat.Design.5.19.2011.r</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Legacy GRTS input file:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_1Entiat_Legacy_20110426.txt</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Master GRTS input file:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; _1Entiat_MS_20110426.txt</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stratum notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Transport</strong>:&nbsp; category contained only 8 master sample sites (7 public, 1 private); all were assigned an annual panel.&nbsp; This resulted in an extra &ldquo;site-visit&rdquo;, allocated to the&nbsp;depositional/private block (only one private block in&nbsp;depositional&nbsp;valley class)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Depositional&nbsp;and Source</strong>: The proportion of sites in public and private lands for&nbsp;depositional&nbsp;and source strata is listed below.&nbsp; This guided the allocation of sites to public/private categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:217px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"height:20px; width:89px\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"height:20px; width:64px\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Private</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"height:20px; width:64px\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Public</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"height:20px; width:89px\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Depositional</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"height:20px; width:64px\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>0.06</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"height:20px; width:64px\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>0.94</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"height:20px; width:89px\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Source</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"height:20px; width:64px\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>0.16</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"height:20px; width:64px\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>0.84</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>Legacy sites with coded annual, which means the sites were sampled annually in the past, were placed in the annual panel and if any carryover, were then allocated as evenly as possible to the rotating panels.
