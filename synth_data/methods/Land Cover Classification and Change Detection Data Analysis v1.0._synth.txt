2. Abstract: This method describes the importance of land cover information in environmental management and conservation. A widely used tool for analyzing land cover data is FRAGSTATS, which calculates various metrics to describe patterns in land cover maps at multiple levels. The method explains how to use FRAGSTATS to analyze classified rasters, providing a general workflow and highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate settings and metrics based on specific projects. Furthermore, the method discusses a statistical analysis approach using non-parametric statistics for small sample sizes to evaluate land cover class changes over time in modified sites compared to reference sites.
3. Description: Land cover information is crucial for understanding and managing environmental change, as it helps identify priority habitats, urban development areas, or locations of invasive species. Classified maps at different points in time can aid in identifying the location and extent of land cover changes through change detection procedures. FRAGSTATS is a computer software program that calculates metrics describing patterns in categorical rasters (e.g., land cover maps) at patch, class, and landscape levels. It is highly recommended to read the documentation before using FRAGSTATS, as it provides essential information on why and how to run the program, as well as details about all available metrics.

The method describes a general approach for analyzing land cover data using FRAGSTATS, with a focus on its capability to calculate various composition and configuration metrics. Users should make informed choices when selecting settings and metrics based on their project's requirements to obtain meaningful results. The text also provides a step-by-step guide for using FRAGSTATS with classified land cover rasters.

When FRAGSTATS metrics are run on classified rasters of the same area for two time points, they can quantify changes in landscape composition and configuration over time. The method then describes a statistical analysis approach for evaluating modifications' impact on land cover class changes compared to reference sites over time using non-parametric statistics appropriate for small sample sizes with unknown distributions.

The method assumes the user is proficient with software such as ArcGIS 10.x, R, and FRAGSTATS. This approach ensures accurate and relevant analysis of land cover data, enabling better understanding and prediction of environmental change trajectories.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a comprehensive guide on using FRAGSTATS for analyzing land cover data and evaluating changes over time with non-parametric statistics, aiming at users proficient in geospatial analysis software.
5. Constraints: This method assumes that the user has access to and familiarity with ArcGIS 10.x, R, and FRAGSTATS software. Additionally, it requires a good understanding of land cover data and change detection methods. The statistical analysis approach is limited to non-parametric tests suitable for small sample sizes with unknown distributions.
