  "abstractText": "NOAAs survival and travel time model for juvenile salmon,Comprehensive Passage(COMPASS) (Zabel et al. 2008), has the capacity to compute fish exposure to environmental indices that vary in time through the river system. These can be assessed because the timing and location of fish are matched to river conditions. However, COMPASS is also used as a forecasting tool using predictions of hydrosystem operations and, if available, environmental conditions. Forecasts of flow and spill are generated by an independent process Hydro System Simulation (HYDSIM) model, and other inputs such as temperature are modelled using long term averages and flow conditions. However, there is also a need for a predictive model of TDG in order to anticipate potential exposure of juvenile salmon to harmful levels of TDG as an aid to management.In order to have a forecast of TDG, production models are limited to a handful of variables available for the hydrosystem generated through the HYDSIM modelling process . These inputs include: flow, spill% overgeneration spill%, and pool elevations for 15 sites in the hydrosystem.",
