  "abstractText": "The incentive for many restoration activities in the Columbia River Estuary (CRE) is to increase habitat available for rearing and migrating juvenile salmonid ESUs listed as threatened or endangered under ESA. One measure of success in effectiveness evaluations is a demonstration of increased habitat use by salmonids at restored locations relative to reference habitat.  Ultimately, relation of fish habitat use to physical conditions such as water quality will be important for evaluating and predicting restoration success in the CRE. Objective: Evaluate species composition (lowest practical taxon), temporal abundance patterns (catch per unit effort by date), and fish size (fork length or total length) in pre-restoration habitat, post-restoration habitat, and reference sites.",
