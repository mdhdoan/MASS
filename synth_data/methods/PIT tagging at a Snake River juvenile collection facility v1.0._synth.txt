2. Abstract: This passage discusses a method for PIT-tagging large numbers of salmonids at juvenile collection facilities along the Snake River. The necessity for this method arises from the limitations of existing sources and facilities for collecting and tagging fish. The described PIT-tagging facility, built in 2005, has significantly increased the capacity for tagging and includes features to minimize impacts on other researchers' studies.
3. Description: The text describes a PIT-tagging method for salmonids at juvenile collection facilities along the Snake River. A significant challenge is collecting large numbers of fish while minimizing harm. The Smolt Monitoring Program (SMP) and facility laboratories provide limited sources of fish and tagging locations, respectively. To overcome these limitations, researchers can obtain fish from two raceways in the east bank of raceways at Lower Granite Dam juvenile fish facility (JFF).

A PIT-tag diversion system has been developed to reduce NOAA's impact on other researchers' studies by diverting previously tagged fish either to a general collection raceway or to the river. Fish are collected in the NOAA raceways and transferred using an Aqualife fish transfer device. Once inside the facility, fish can be sent via pipes to raceways, holding tanks, or even trucks in parking areas around the facility.

The tagging facility has a sorting room with two stations and 10 PIT-tagging stations on the upper floor, while the lower floor houses a break/lunch room and mechanical room containing three re-circulating anesthetic systems. Each system is equipped with filters, a UV-sterilization system, and a chiller, allowing for efficient and safe tagging operations.

In 2005, NOAA researchers successfully tagged over 21,000 salmonids in an 8-hour day using this facility. The design of the facility allows multiple studies to share the same collection of fish, reducing overall research impact.

4. Target: To develop and implement a large-scale PIT-tagging method for salmonids at juvenile collection facilities along the Snake River, increasing efficiency while minimizing impacts on other researchers' studies.
5. Constraints: The main constraints of this method include limitations in existing fish sources and tagging locations, as well as the need to minimize harm to fish during collection and handling. The described PIT-tagging facility addresses these challenges by providing a more efficient and less impactful solution for large-scale salmonid tagging.
