  "abstractText": "Trawling has been an effective yet often controversial technique to sample aquatic organisms (Herzog et al. 2005). Trawl gear are probably the most commonly used sampling gear in oceanic and estuarine habitats, but trawl gear are only occasionally used in large rivers (Hayes et al. 1996). When they are used in large rivers, astandard two-seam balloon trawl is common to sample benthic fishes for the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP;Gutreuter et al. 1995). This sampling technique is often conducted at permanently fixed sampling sites in thetailwater zone (TWZ) sampling area.Tailwater zones are highly variable day-to-day and among riverreaches, and thus methods for trawling these areas may change depending on time of year and site.",
