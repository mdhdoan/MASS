2. Abstract:
This method documents mortality of juvenile salmonid by birds nesting in the Columbia River estuary using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags. By calculating avian predation rates based on PIT-tagged fish released and/or detected passing hydroelectric dams, this approach allows for hypothesis testing on how smolt morphology, condition, abundance, and origin impact their vulnerability to bird predation.

3. Description:
The method described in the text involves the use of passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to monitor mortality of juvenile salmonids due to avian predation in the Columbia River estuary. PIT tags, which represent unique fish, are used to calculate predation rates based on the percentage of tagged juveniles that are subsequently consumed and deposited by birds on their nesting colonies. Data from hydroelectric dams is used to determine how many released or detected fish pass through these dams. This method enables researchers to test hypotheses regarding the effects of smolt morphology, condition, abundance, and origin on vulnerability to avian predation.

4. Target:
The primary focus of this method is to estimate avian predation rates for juvenile salmonids in the Columbia River estuary using PIT tags and data from hydroelectric dams.

5. Constraints:
This method relies on several factors, including successful tagging of juvenile salmonids, accurate detection of tags at hydroelectric dams, and appropriate deposition of consumed fish remains on bird colonies. Additionally, the effectiveness of this method may be limited by the availability of suitable nesting sites for birds and their willingness to use them.
