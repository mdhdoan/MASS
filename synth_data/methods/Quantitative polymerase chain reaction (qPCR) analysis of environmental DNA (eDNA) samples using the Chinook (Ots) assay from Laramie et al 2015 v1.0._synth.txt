 1. Keywords: Environmental DNA (eDNA), Chinook salmon, Oncorynchus tshawytscha, qPCR analysis, Okanogan Basin
2. Abstract: This method discusses the use of Environmental DNA (eDNA) assays, specifically targeting Chinook salmon (Oncorynchus tshawytscha) in the Okanogan Basin. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis is used to determine the presence/absence and quantity of Chinook DNA in water samples. The quantity of eDNA may correlate with organism abundance, though various uncontrolled factors can make interpretation challenging and lower confidence in estimates.
3. Description: This method focuses on Environmental DNA (eDNA) assays, used to detect specific target organisms in environmental samples such as water. Here, the target organism is Chinook salmon (Oncorynchus tshawytscha) from the Okanogan Basin. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis is employed for eDNA quantification, which reveals both presence/absence and quantity of Chinook DNA in water samples. However, while the amount of eDNA can indicate organism abundance, interpreting it accurately is difficult due to uncontrolled variables that might affect the correlation between eDNA concentration and fish abundance, reducing estimate confidence.
4. Target: The main objective of this method is to detect and quantify Chinook salmon eDNA in water samples from the Okanogan Basin using qPCR analysis.
5. Constraints: A significant constraint for this eDNA-based method involves accurately estimating organism abundance based on eDNA concentration, as uncontrolled variables can make such interpretation challenging and less reliable.
