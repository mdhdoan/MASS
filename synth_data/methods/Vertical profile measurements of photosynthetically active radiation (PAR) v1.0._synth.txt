2. Abstract: This text describes the importance of measuring and understanding Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) in aquatic environments. PAR is the range of solar radiation that plants can use for photosynthesis, typically between 400-700 nanometers. Vertical profiles of PAR can be used to calculate the compensation depth, or the maximum depth at which photosynthesis is possible. This information is crucial for assessing management actions' effects on primary productivity in lakes and reservoirs and designing monitoring programs to understand changes in primary production or phytoplankton communities.
3. Description: The text begins by defining Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) as solar radiation between 400 and 700 nanometers in wavelength, the spectrum that can be used by plants for photosynthesis. Vertical profiles of PAR are then introduced as a tool to calculate the compensation depth (CD), which is the maximum depth at which photosynthesis is possible. This information is crucial for understanding where primary productivity occurs in the water column and designing monitoring programs or studies to understand changes in primary production or phytoplankton communities. The text then goes on to describe standard procedures used for the collection of field data used to construct vertical profiles of PAR, including the use of a quantum sensor and data logger to measure the amount of PAR at different depths.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide standard procedures for collecting field data to construct vertical profiles of PAR, which can be used to calculate the compensation depth and understand where primary productivity occurs in the water column.
5. Constraints: The main constraint of this method is the availability of specialized equipment such as a quantum sensor and data logger, as well as the need for trained personnel to carry out the measurements correctly. Additionally, weather conditions and water turbidity can affect the accuracy of PAR measurements.
