 1. Keywords: Aerial photography, photo points, GIS-based measurements, landform changes, vegetation patterns.

2. Abstract: Aerial photography and photo points are used to monitor changes in landforms and vegetation patterns as part of restoration projects. This method allows for accurate measurement and quantification of project-wide changes using GIS-based tools. These measurements include site area, tidal channel dimensions, and the size and configuration of landforms and vegetation communities. By tracking these changes over time, managers can assess the effectiveness of restoration efforts and make informed decisions about future projects.

3. Description: The use of aerial photography and photo points is a critical component of restoration project management, as it allows for the measurement and quantification of changes in landforms and vegetation patterns. These measurements are conducted using GIS-based tools, which enable accurate and precise calculations of site area, tidal channel dimensions, and the size and configuration of landforms and vegetation communities. By tracking these changes over time, managers can assess the success of restoration efforts and make data-driven decisions about future projects.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to quantify project-wide changes in landform and vegetation patterns as part of restoration efforts.

5. Constraints: Some potential constraints for this method include limitations in image quality, difficulties in accurately identifying vegetation communities, and challenges in measuring changes in complex or dynamic systems. Additionally, the success of this method is dependent on consistent and accurate data collection over time, which can be resource-intensive and require specialized expertise.
