2. Abstract: This method, identified as Method ID 71, outlines the procedures for conducting stream sampling and data collection activities. It emphasizes the importance of confirming the correct site and assessing the influence of rain events on the representativeness of field data and samples. The method introduces the concept of a support reach, which is a length of stream sampled at each sampling point to obtain a representative picture of the biological assemblages and habitat conditions. This approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the sampling point.

3. Description: Upon arriving at a stream site, the first step is to confirm the correct location. The method then requires determining if the stream meets certain criteria for sampling and data collection, including an assessment of whether the stream is unduly influenced by rain events. If the stream is to be sampled, the next step involves laying out a defined reach within which all subsequent sampling and measurement activities will occur. At each sampling point (X-site location), response designs for various indicators must be implemented. Unlike chemistry, which can be measured at a single point, the response designs for biological assemblage and physical habitat indicators require sampling a length of stream to obtain a representative picture of the assemblages and habitat conditions. The length of stream sampled at each sampling point is termed the support reach, established based on several studies.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a systematic approach for conducting stream sampling and data collection activities that yield representative results.

5. Constraints: This method requires careful consideration of several constraints, including the potential influence of rain events on field data and samples, as well as the need to sample an appropriate length of stream at each sampling point (support reach) to ensure a comprehensive characterization of the biological assemblages and habitat conditions. Additionally, certain conditions during the visit may warrant the collection of only a subset of field measurements and samples.
