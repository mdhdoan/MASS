   * Active channel width
   * Stream size reference
   * Flow level
   * Valley characteristics
   * Enhancement efforts
2. Abstract:
   Active channel width is a method used to evaluate all stream and valley characteristics, providing a reference to stream size regardless of the flow level at the time of the survey. This high-level overview approach allows for a comprehensive assessment of streams and valleys, which can be useful in estimating valley width index and determining appropriate types of enhancement efforts.
3. Description:
   Active channel width is a scale used to evaluate stream and valley characteristics, providing a reference point for stream size that is not affected by the flow level at the time of the survey. This method is important because it allows for a standardized evaluation of streams and valleys, which can be useful in making comparisons between different locations or time periods. The active channel width information can be used to estimate the valley width index, which is a measure of the width of the valley floor relative to the stream width. This information can also help determine appropriate types of enhancement efforts, such as bank stabilization or habitat improvement projects.
4. Target:
   The primary focus of the active channel width method is to provide a standardized scale for evaluating all stream and valley characteristics, allowing for comprehensive assessments that can be used to make comparisons, estimate valley width index, and determine appropriate enhancement efforts.
5. Constraints:
   One constraint of the active channel width method is that it requires accurate measurement of the active channel width, which can be challenging in areas with complex stream patterns or vegetation. Additionally, the method assumes that the flow level at the time of the survey is representative of typical flow conditions, which may not always be the case. Finally, interpretation of active channel width data requires some technical expertise to ensure accurate and meaningful results.
