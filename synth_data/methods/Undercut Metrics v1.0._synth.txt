 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the five most relevant keywords that summarize the text body:

1. Undercut banks
2. Area or volume calculation
3. Continuous cave-like features
4. Measurements (width, depth, length)
5. Floodplain indicators

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract:
Undercut banks are important features in steep channels without floodplains, as they serve as indicators of bankfull stage and provide information about the total area or volume of undercut banks across a site. This method outlines the steps required to measure undercut banks that meet specific criteria (i.e., continuous cave-like features with an average width of 10cm and length of 1m). The measurements include width, depth, and length at three equidistant locations, which are then used to calculate the area or volume of each undercut and summed across the site. This method is useful for understanding the stability of streambanks, sediment transport, and erosion processes.
3. Description:
The text body describes a method for measuring undercut banks in steep channels without floodplains. To qualify as an undercut bank, it must be a continuous cave-like feature with an average width of 10cm and length of 1m. The measurements include the upper extent of the undercut (slightly below bankfull stage), width (the horizontal distance from the top of the overhanging bank to the back wall of the undercut), and length (measured along the edge of water). These measurements are taken at three equidistant locations, and the area or volume of each undercut is calculated using the length x width formula. The total area or volume is then summed across the site.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide a standardized way of measuring undercut banks in steep channels without floodplains, which can serve as indicators of bankfull stage and sediment transport processes.
5. Constraints:
This method requires access to the undercut banks for measurement purposes, which may not be feasible in some cases due to safety concerns or limited accessibility. Additionally, the measurements are subject to errors due to variations in the shape and size of undercut banks, making it difficult to obtain accurate and precise estimates.
