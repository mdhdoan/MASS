  "abstractText": "At the TD-1 project waterfowl abundance counts have been occurring for four consecutive years to monitor spring migration and waterfowl response to increased habitat management through moist soil management. Flooding, drawdown, planting, vegetation management, and noxious weed control are all tools used in moist soil management. As we become more precise in timing and scheduling of these events, waterfowl numbers have responded positively. 2021 is the second-year camera traps have been deployed in the TD-2 project area. The intention of the TD-2 project area was to create 71 acres of hemi marsh habitat to provide brood ponds for local waterfowl production. Currently with tall emergent vegetation and sedimentation, wetlands in TD-2 are seeing very low amounts of waterfowl production. Our goal is to have cameras surveying the area to witness the positive response in waterfowl use as more habitat management occurs. Management activities to control tall emergent vegetation was primarily chemical control of Phragmites. In our study design biologists place elevated camera traps across habitats in a project area. Photos are taken every hour from sunrise to sunset and each camera trap has a measurable surface area (1 acre)to create sub-samples of density estimates across the project area.",
