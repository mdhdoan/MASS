 Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize and label the key topics in your text. Here are five relevant keywords:

1. Population size estimation
2. Anadromous fish species
3. Spatial-stream-network (SSN) models
4. Kriging (universal and block)
5. Covariates and habitat factors

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract:
Population size estimates for anadromous fish species are crucial for conservation and management purposes. However, high sampling costs limit the extent of most estimates to small portions of river networks. To address this issue, a new method has been developed that leverages large fish density datasets, SSN models, and national geospatial database frameworks for streams. This method uses universal kriging to predict a continuous map of densities among survey locations and block kriging to summarize discrete map areas and make population estimates at various stream, river, and network scales. Additionally, reach covariates are incorporated into SSN models to assess habitat factors that may affect the distribution and density of fish species. The SSN-BK population estimator is implemented using STARS and SSN software in the ArcGIS and R computing environments.

3. Description:
The method described in the text aims to improve population size estimation for anadromous fish species in river networks. Sampling costs are often a limiting factor in obtaining accurate estimates, so the authors propose a new approach that takes advantage of large fish density datasets, SSN models, and national geospatial database frameworks for streams. Specifically, the method uses universal kriging to predict a continuous map of densities among survey locations and block kriging to summarize discrete map areas and make population estimates at various stream, river, and network scales. Reach covariates are also incorporated into SSN models to assess habitat factors that may affect the distribution and density of fish species. The SSN-BK population estimator is implemented using STARS and SSN software in the ArcGIS and R computing environments.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide a broadly scalable approach to population estimation for anadromous fish species, which can be limited by high sampling costs.

5. Constraints:
One constraint of this method is the availability and quality of large fish density datasets. Additionally, the accuracy of the population estimates may depend on the appropriateness of the covariates used in the SSN models, as well as the assumptions underlying the kriging methods. Finally, the computational resources required to implement the SSN-BK population estimator may be a limiting factor in some cases.
