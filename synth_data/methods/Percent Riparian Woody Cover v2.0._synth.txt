2. Abstract:
Method #1247, version 2.0, is a revised and updated approach to estimating riparian cover, developed by Carol Volk and updated by CTUIR on 12-19-2018. The method uses the CHaMP-Riparian Structure Method, based on Peck et al. (2001) methods from the EMAP, to calculate the percent of woody riparian cover within a 10mx10m plot. Estimates are taken at 5 transects along both right and left banks, measuring groundstory, understory, and canopy cover of woody shrubs and trees. This approach provides a standardized, accurate, and consistent means for assessing riparian health and condition.

3. Description:
Method #1247, version 2.0, is the most recent revision of this method by Carol Volk. It was versioned on 12-19-2018 by Sheryn Olson for updating by CTUIR. The method focuses on estimating the percent of woody riparian cover within a 10mx10m plot, with estimates taken at 5 transects along both right and left banks. The method uses the CHaMP-Riparian Structure Method, which is based on Peck et al. (2001) methods from the EMAP.

The estimation process involves measuring groundstory, understory, and canopy cover of woody shrubs and trees. Groundstory refers to woody shrubs, understory refers to smaller woody shrubs, while canopy cover measures larger trees and small trees. The method aims to provide a standardized and accurate means for assessing riparian health and condition, with clear guidelines for measurements and calculations.

4. Target:
The primary focus of Method #1247 is to estimate the percent of woody riparian cover within a 10mx10m plot, using standardized and accurate measurement techniques.

5. Constraints:
No specific constraints are mentioned in the provided text body. However, the method requires careful measurements and calculations, as well as a clear understanding of the different types of woody cover (groundstory, understory, canopy cover) to ensure accurate results. Additionally, the use of transects along both right and left banks requires access to the riparian area and appropriate permissions for data collection.
