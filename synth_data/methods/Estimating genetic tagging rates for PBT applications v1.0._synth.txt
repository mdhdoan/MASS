2. Abstract: This text discusses the use of Parentage Based Tagging (PBT) to gather information on the origin of hatchery fish in the Columbia River basin. As PBT becomes more widely adopted, it is essential for managers to understand how genetic tagging rates are calculated and how various sampling scenarios can affect the estimation of these rates. The text provides a visual explanation of different genetic tagging rate scenarios, with emphasis on the impact of incomplete broodstock sampling. Several simple methods to estimate PBT tagging rates are reviewed, highlighting their assumptions and accuracy under specific conditions.

3. Description: The text begins by acknowledging the increasing use of PBT for hatchery fish in the Columbia River basin and the need for managers to understand genetic tagging rates. A visual explanation of PBT tagging rates is presented using various schematics, as traditional mathematical formulas might not offer an easily understood or remembered concept. Managers are assumed to be familiar with tagging rates from conventional physical tagging technologies, such as CWTs, where the total number of hatchery-produced fish is enumerated, and a direct measure of tagging rate can be calculated after tagging a subset.

   In contrast, PBT uses parental broodstock for calculating tagging rates instead of directly tagging the progeny. Both male and female broodstock in each spawning cross must be genetically sampled and successfully genotyped to enable PBT tagging for their offspring. A 100% tagging rate is achieved if all parents are sampled and genotyped, but the overall tagging rate decreases as a result of failing to sample or genotype either parent from a spawning cross.

   The text highlights that PBT tagging rates less than 100% need to be estimated using several simple methods, each with its own assumptions. The methods are reviewed and illustrated to determine which method provides the most accurate estimate under specific scenarios of incomplete broodstock sampling.

4. Target: The primary focus of this text is on introducing Parentage Based Tagging (PBT) for hatchery fish, particularly for managers unfamiliar with genetic tagging rates and how various sampling scenarios can affect their estimation.
5. Constraints: The main constraint of the PBT method lies in the reliance on complete broodstock sampling and successful genotyping to ensure a 100% tagging rate. When broodstock sampling is incomplete, estimating tagging rates becomes necessary using various methods with their own assumptions, potentially affecting the accuracy of the estimate.
