2. Abstract: Hydrodynamic modeling is a crucial method for determining effective water management strategies aimed at reducing the recruitment of nan-native fish predators. This process involves multiple stages, including threshold setting, 2-D scenario modeling, 2-D model validation, and Chinook salmon stranding and entrapment risk assessment. By following these sequential steps, the modeling approach can provide accurate data to inform decision-making and help mitigate the negative impacts of invasive fish species on local ecosystems.

3. Description: The text outlines a hydrodynamic modeling method aimed at water management for reducing nan-native fish predator recruitment. This process unfolds in four stages, starting with threshold setting, where specific conditions are defined to trigger subsequent stages. Next is 2-D scenario modeling, which involves creating and analyzing various scenarios based on the established thresholds. The third stage focuses on validating the 2-D model using real-world data to ensure its accuracy. Lastly, the method incorporates a Chinook salmon stranding and entrapment risk assessment, sharing the same methods as the initial threshold setting stage. This final step evaluates the potential risks and informs appropriate management actions.

4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to develop a comprehensive hydrodynamic modeling approach for water management targeting nan-native fish predator reduction and Chinook salmon stranding risk mitigation.

5. Constraints: Possible constraints for this method could include limited data availability, computational resources, or challenges in accurately modeling complex environmental systems. Additionally, the success of the risk assessment stage depends on reliable data regarding Chinook salmon stranding and entrapment, which might not always be available or consistently gathered.
