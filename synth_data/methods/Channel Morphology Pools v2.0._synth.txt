 1. Keywords: Pool measurement, habitat quantification, residual depth, length frequency, site analysis.

2. Abstract: This method outlines the criteria and instructions for measuring pool length and residual pool depth in various sites. The primary objective is to quantify the relative length and frequency of pool habitats, as well as determine the average residual depth of these pools. By accurately measuring these parameters, researchers can better understand aquatic ecosystems and their characteristics, leading to more informed decision-making and management strategies.

3. Description: The text provides a detailed explanation of a method used for quantifying pool habitats in different sites. The objectives include assessing the relative length and frequency of pool habitats and calculating average residual depths. This information is crucial for understanding the ecological roles of these aquatic environments and their potential to support various species. The method emphasizes the importance of accurate measurements and offers guidelines on how to effectively collect data related to pool length and depth. Constraints and considerations, such as accessibility and safety, are discussed to ensure successful implementation of this method in diverse field conditions.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is quantifying and analyzing pool habitats in various sites to support informed decision-making and ecosystem management.

5. Constraints: Implementing this method may involve several constraints, including but not limited to:
   - Accessibility: Challenges in reaching the pools due to terrain or other environmental factors
   - Safety: Precautions must be taken when working near or in water to prevent accidents
   - Equipment: Appropriate tools and devices are required for accurate measurements
   - Time: Adequate time must be allocated for data collection and analysis
   - Weather: Adverse weather conditions may hinder data collection efforts.
