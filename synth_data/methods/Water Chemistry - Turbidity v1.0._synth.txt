2. Abstract: The Columbia River Basin is facing a significant decline in anadromous salmonid populations, with several of them now protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). A comprehensive and reliable monitoring strategy is necessary to address the uncertainties surrounding these declines and develop effective recovery plans. This method focuses on continuously monitoring seven water quality attributes at integrator sites downstream from each population or subpopulation, in accordance with the UCMS guidelines. These measurements are supplemented with seasonal nutrient assessments, ensuring data accuracy and compliance with Data Quality Level A standards. By coupling water quality monitoring stations with associated flow gauges, this method allows for a thorough analysis of the effects of stream flow on water quality attributes, providing valuable insights for ESA assessment and recovery planning.
3. Description: The text presents a detailed description of a monitoring strategy for anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin, where populations have experienced significant declines over the past 30 years. With several populations now protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), there is a pressing need for reliable data to inform assessment and recovery efforts. The UCMS guidelines recommend monitoring seven water quality attributes, including temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorous.

The method proposes continuous monitoring of these attributes at integrator sites located downstream from each population or subpopulation. This strategy allows for the assessment of water quality impacts on salmonid populations at various spatial scales, as required by the ESA. The accuracy of water quality instruments is maintained at Data Quality Level A, following the Oregon Watershed Plan Water Quality Monitoring Technical Guidebook (2001). Additionally, seasonal nutrient assessments are performed through monthly grab samples at these same sites.

Water quality monitoring stations are integrated with associated flow gauges operated by the USGS or WDOE to enable the evaluation of stream flow effects on water quality attributes. This methodology facilitates a better understanding of how varying flow rates impact salmonid habitats and provides essential data for ESA assessments and recovery planning.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to implement a comprehensive monitoring strategy for anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin, ensuring reliable data collection at various spatial scales to support ESA assessment and recovery planning efforts.
5. Constraints: Potential constraints for this method include limited resources for setting up and maintaining water quality monitoring stations and associated flow gauges, difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements in complex river systems, and challenges in coordinating efforts across multiple agencies and organizations involved in the monitoring and management of Columbia River Basin salmonid populations.
