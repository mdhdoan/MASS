2. Abstract: The limnetic gill net survey is a crucial method for verifying the species of acoustic targets detected during mobile hydroacoustic surveys in Banks Lake. This survey provides essential information on depth distributions and length frequencies of larger fish targets. By conducting a lake-wide fall gill netting survey, researchers can monitor the relative abundance of game fishes and apex predators, as well as determine age, growth, and condition indices through biological data collection.
3. Description: The limnetic gill net survey is an important component in the assessment of fish populations in Banks Lake. It follows the reference method 991 for conducting such surveys. The primary objective of this method is to verify the species of targets detected during hydroacoustic surveys and gather data on depth distributions and length frequencies of larger acoustic targets. A fall gill netting survey, such as FWIN (Morgan 2002), is utilized for monitoring the relative abundance of game fishes and apex predators in the lake. The collected data from this survey allows researchers to determine fish species composition, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), and collect biological data necessary for determining age, growth, and condition indices.
4. Target: The primary focus of the limnetic gill net survey is to gather comprehensive information on fish populations in Banks Lake, including species identification, depth distributions, length frequencies, relative abundance, age, growth, and condition indices.
5. Constraints: The success of the limnetic gill net survey depends on various factors such as weather conditions, water clarity, fish behavior, and the accuracy of hydroacoustic surveys in detecting targets. Additionally, the availability and accessibility of appropriate gill netting equipment and resources can also pose constraints to this method.
