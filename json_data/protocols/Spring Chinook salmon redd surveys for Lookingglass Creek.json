  "assumptions": "<p>All redds constructed in the selected reaches are counted. Each redd is counted once and only once. Accurate redd/female factor is used. GPS coordinates are accurate.</p>\r\n",
  "objectives": [
    "Estimate temporal distribution of redds.",
    "Estimate spatial distribution of redds.",
    "Estimate the number of spawning females.",
    "Estimate the numbers of natural-origin spring Chinook salmon spawners over time."
