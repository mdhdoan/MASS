  "abstractText": "The objective of post-season chick carcass surveys is to locate and count all dead Caspian tern and double-crested cormorant chicks and to recover bands from any that are marked with color, alpha-numeric, or metal bands. This information is used to more accurately estimate nesting success (productivity) of the colony and, for birds with leg bands, to more accurately estimate demography and dispersal patterns (see Method entitled  Banding and Band Resighting for Caspian Terns and Double-Crested Cormorants).",
