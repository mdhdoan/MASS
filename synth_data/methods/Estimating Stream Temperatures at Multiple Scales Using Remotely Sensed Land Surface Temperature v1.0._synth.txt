2. Abstract: This study presents a novel method for estimating mean daily stream temperatures using remotely-sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST) data. The research focuses on the John Day River in Oregon, USA, and five watersheds within the interior Columbia River basin. By building models at various spatial scales, the study demonstrates accurate and robust estimates of stream temperature for broad regions with sparse observational data. This approach offers valuable insights for researchers and managers interested in stream biota and can help inform water management strategies.
3. Description: The paper discusses a method to estimate mean daily stream temperatures using remotely-sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST) data at confluence-to-confluence reaches within the John Day River, OR, USA. Models were constructed at three spatial scales - site-specific, subwatershed, and basin-wide - with quality assessed using jackknife and cross-validation methods. Model metrics showed strong correlations between predicted and observed values for all sites and years across the different scales. Similar analyses were conducted on 2012 8-day composite LST data in five watersheds of the interior Columbia River basin, resulting in high r2 and low RMSE values. Sensitivity analysis revealed that accurate basin-wide models could be parameterized using as few as four temperature logger sites. This method generates robust estimates of stream temperatures through time for large spatial regions with sparse observational data, which can assist researchers and managers studying stream biota.
4. Target: The primary focus of this study is to develop a reliable and accurate method for estimating stream temperatures using remotely-sensed LST data in regions where observational data may be limited or inconsistent.
5. Constraints: One constraint for the current method could be the availability of high-quality Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, which might be affected by cloud cover or other atmospheric conditions. Another constraint is the need for a sufficient number of temperature logger sites to ensure accurate model parameterization in large watersheds.
