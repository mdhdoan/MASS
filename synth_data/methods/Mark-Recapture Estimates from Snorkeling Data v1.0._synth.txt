2. Abstract: Snorkeling is a non-invasive method used for underwater observation and study of fish in flowing waters. It can be used with mark-recapture techniques to estimate fish abundance by comparing the results with other methods such as electrofishing and seining. The use of block nets ensures a closed system, allowing for accurate population estimates. Marking fish using tags or dyes and recounting them through snorkel surveys provides a calibration factor, highlighting the effectiveness of snorkeling compared to other survey methods. This technique can also identify species and size-classes that may have been undercounted.
3. Description: Snorkeling as a method for fish observation is used in flowing waters and can be paired with mark-recapture techniques to estimate fish abundance. A closed system is maintained using block nets, allowing the total population observed to remain constant. The mark-recapture process involves collecting, marking, and releasing fish back into the sample area. Collection can be done through electrofishing, seining, or trapping, while marking uses tags or dyes with color coding or patterns. Release is then carried out in the sample reach. Subsequent snorkel surveys are conducted to count marked fish. The ratio of resighted (marked) fish serves as a calibration factor for the effectiveness of snorkeling compared to other survey methods. This technique can also differentiate species and size-classes that may have been undercounted during initial snorkel surveys, providing valuable insights into population dynamics.
4. Target: The primary focus is on using snorkeling as an observation method in conjunction with mark-recapture techniques for estimating fish abundance in flowing waters and comparing its effectiveness to other survey methods.
5. Constraints: This method requires a closed system to maintain an accurate count, limiting its use to areas where block nets can be effectively employed. Additionally, the reliance on visual observation may lead to undercounting certain species or size-classes, necessitating alternative marking and identification methods.
