2. Abstract:
   Reconnection of tidal influence in estuarine systems can lead to changes in vegetation composition and distribution. To measure these alterations and assess progress toward reference plant communities, a method using data from plant community protocols is proposed. This approach allows for the evaluation of successional trajectories, contributing to the understanding and management of restored estuarine ecosystems.

3. Description:
   The text discusses the use of data gathered from plant community protocols to assess changes in vegetation species composition and distribution in estuarine systems undergoing reconnection to tidal influence. By monitoring these changes, researchers can evaluate successional trajectories toward a predefined reference community, gaining insights into the ecological recovery process. This information is crucial for managing restored ecosystems and ensuring their development aligns with desired outcomes.

4. Target:
   The primary focus of this method is to assess the success of estuarine plant community restoration projects by measuring changes in vegetation composition and distribution following reconnection to tidal influence.

5. Constraints:
   - Data quality and consistency from various plant community protocols
   - Availability and accessibility of historical data for comparison
   - Variability in environmental factors affecting vegetation growth and succession
   - Time required for observable changes in vegetation to occur after reconnection to tidal influence.
