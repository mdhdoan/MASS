  "description": "<p>CHaMP&nbsp;is designed as a Columbia River basin-wide habitat status and trends monitoring program built around a single protocol with a programmatic approach to data collection and management (RM&amp;E Workgroup 2010).&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will result in the collection and analysis of systematic habitat status and trends information that will be used to assess basin-wide habitat conditions. When coupled with biological response indicators, this status and trends information will be used to evaluate habitat management strategies. This program will be integrated with ongoing Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Program (PNAMP) recovery planning efforts and will be part of the collaborative process across Columbia Basin fish management agencies and tribes and other state and federal agencies that are monitoring&nbsp;anadromous&nbsp;salmonids&nbsp;and/or their habitat. The implementation of&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;will characterize stream responses to watershed restoration and/or management actions in at least one population within each steelhead and spring Chinook Major Population Group (MPG) which have, or will have, &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-out&rdquo; monitoring (identified in&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;50.6), thereby meeting the requirements of&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;56.3,&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;57, and&nbsp;RPA&nbsp;3.&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;was designed to deliver trends in habitat indicators and requires that monitoring occurs for three cycles of a sampling panel, at least 9 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;status and trends domain includes the&nbsp;mainstem&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;and a short distance up several tributaries,&nbsp;targetting&nbsp;the Chinook population and covering the most important domain of the Steelhead (Snake River&nbsp;DPS)&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;River Population.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;will receive a significant amount of treatment over the coming years through restoration work by the Snake River Salmon Recovery Board; a system of treatment/control groups has been set up yielding a set of tiny treatment/control strata as part of the&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;study design.&nbsp; The design splits the sampling into these paired groups and to&nbsp;&ldquo;mainstem&rdquo;&nbsp;and &ldquo;tributary&rdquo; groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The standard valley class stratification was abandoned for&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;partly because all sites fell into the&nbsp;depositional&nbsp;stratum, and partly because of the treatment-control design imposed.&nbsp; As well, the private/public split was abandoned given the small number of choices in most of the treatment/control strata and the small target frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2015 sample design notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All core&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;designs were updated to accommodate effort that will go towards the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://isemp.egnyte.com/dl/EcV8YyGyV5\" style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 16.7999992370605px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">10% repeat design for&nbsp;CHaMP</a>. &nbsp; The design update will result in 3 annual sites from the active design (e.g. 2014) and move one to each rotating panel. &nbsp;This will result in a net freeing of 2 visits each year that can be used to revisit 2 sites. &nbsp;This change preserves the annual sites within the design and adjusts the frequency of sampling. &nbsp;2 sites slated for sampling in the current year (e.g. 2015) will be randomly selected for repeat sampling.\u200b</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following three sites were selected by ELR (Hill) to be removed from the Annual panel and shifted to each of the rotating panels.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"font-size:12px; line-height:1.4em\">Changes made to accommodate repeat sampling effort:\u200b</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-169855, Treatment Reach 5-Treatment moved to rotating panel 1<br />\r\nCBW05583-427903, Treatment Reach 4-Treatment moved to rotating panel 3<br />\r\nCBW05583-432587, Treatment Reach 6-Control moved to rotating panel 2</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Additional changes requested by Hill in 2015:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200b\u200b\u200bCBW05583-072139 (treatment reach 2-treatment): Change from Annual to PY3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBW05583-214475 (mainstem): Change from PY3 to Annual, use order became 1, even though original GRTS order puts it farther down in the list. &nbsp;had to put it at 1 to get sampled in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Site 274303 was not sampled as an AEM annual in 2014 and was therefore moved back into RP3. &nbsp;This change will also be made in the 2014 design.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>block orders also adjusted for all of these changes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2014 sample design notes:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No changes from 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6/24/2014: Two sites from the Tucannon CHaMP design changed Blocks to accommodate AEM sampling in 2014. &nbsp;CBW05583-274303&nbsp;was originally allocated to Rotating Panel 3-Treatment Reach 2-Control, Use order 1 and was moved to Annual AEM-Treatment Reach 2-Control.

To maximize the ability to determine the effectiveness of restoration actions, the domain of inference in the&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;River to include only the spring Chinook domain as defined in the&nbsp;subbasin&nbsp;plan (SRSRB&nbsp;2011). This restricted domain of inference was established because the focus of restoration efforts in the&nbsp;Tucannon&nbsp;River are targeted at spring Chinook (ADEQ&nbsp;2011) and the&nbsp;SRSRB&nbsp;is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of habitat restoration as part of the&nbsp;BiOP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment and control areas were used as&nbsp;strata.&nbsp;This ensured&nbsp;that&nbsp;CHaMP&nbsp;sites were allocated in treatment and control areas throughout the domain of inference. This approach will allow for effectiveness monitoring of the restoration actions. A small sampling effort was put into &#39;mainstem&#39; and &#39;tributary&#39; strata for status and trends monitoring of&nbsp;non-restoration areas within the domain. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tucannon&nbsp;Frame File:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://isemp.egnyte.com/h-s/20140327/CmDZF8xoKt\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">TucannonFrameFile.zip</a></p>\r\n",
