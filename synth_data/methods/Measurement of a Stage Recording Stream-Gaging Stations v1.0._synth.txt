2. Abstract: The sensing stage for automatic recording of data involves two main methods. One method uses a float in a stilling well to sense the water level, while another method utilizes a gas-purge system called a bubble gage that transmits water pressure head directly to a manometer. These methods provide an efficient and accurate way of collecting data without the need for manual intervention, enhancing the reliability and speed of data collection.
3. Description: In automatic recording systems, there are two primary ways to sense the stage for the purpose of recording data. The first method involves placing a float in a stilling well that is connected to the water source being monitored. This setup enables the float to move up and down according to changes in the water level, which can then be recorded automatically. An alternative approach is to use a gas-purge system known as a bubble gage. In this method, the pressure head of water in a stream is directly transmitted to a manometer through a gas-purge system, eliminating the need for a stilling well. This setup allows for more straightforward installation and maintenance while providing accurate data.
4. Target: The primary focus of these methods is to provide efficient and reliable sensing mechanisms for automatic recording systems in various applications such as hydrological monitoring, water resource management, and environmental studies.
5. Constraints: While both methods have their advantages, they also come with certain limitations. For instance, the use of a stilling well may be constrained by site conditions, as it requires a stable structure for proper installation. On the other hand, bubble gages may not perform optimally in turbid or dirty water conditions due to potential gas lock issues and require regular maintenance to ensure accuracy and functionality.
