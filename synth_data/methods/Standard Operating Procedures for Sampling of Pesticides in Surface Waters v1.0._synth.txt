2. Abstract: The Environmental Assessment Program (EAP) has developed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for collecting samples to monitor pesticides in surface waters. This method is crucial for effectively tracking the presence and concentration of various pesticides, which can serve different objectives ranging from monitoring specific chemicals to identifying a wide range of compounds. The SOP emphasizes the importance of collecting Total Suspended Solids (TSS) samples alongside pesticide samples due to potential relationships between TSS and hydrophobic pesticides.
3. Description: This text outlines the Environmental Assessment Program's Standard Operating Procedure (EAP SOP) for collecting surface water samples to monitor pesticides, which include herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. The procedure addresses a variety of monitoring objectives that can focus on specific chemicals or cover a wide range of compounds. A relationship between Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and hydrophobic pesticides is highlighted, often requiring TSS samples to be collected alongside pesticide samples for accurate analysis. This SOP serves as a guideline for collecting surface water samples to determine the presence and concentration of pesticides, ensuring proper data collection and facilitating effective decision-making in environmental management.
4. Target: The primary focus of this EAP SOP is to establish a systematic approach for monitoring pesticides in surface waters to support informed decision-making and regulatory compliance.
5. Constraints: Possible constraints include resource limitations, accessibility to sampling locations, seasonal variations in pesticide usage, and the need for specialized equipment and trained personnel to collect and analyze samples accurately.
