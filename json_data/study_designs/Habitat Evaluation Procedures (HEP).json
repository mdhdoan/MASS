  "backgroundRationale": "<p>This document was developed to provide consistency with how habitat variable data is collected throughout the Columbia Basin Region in support of the Columbia River Wildlife Mitigation Program funded by Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). This publication is a &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; reference for Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) and Combined Habitat Assessment Protocols (CHAP) transect techniques used by the Regional HEP Team (RHT).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This document is intended to be a &ldquo;user friendly&rdquo; habitat variable measurement technique manual for both novice and experienced field technicians alike. As a result, theory and mathematical/statistical discussions are held to a minimum. It is assumed that field technicians will possess the specific measuring devices discussed in this manual. Thus, device descriptions are limited in most cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>English measurements e. g., inches, feet, etc., are used to accommodate measurements found in many HEP models and because English measurements are better understood by the general public. English measurements can easily be converted to metric equivalents if needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>General and specific protocols are described in the following sections. General protocols include a brief description of pre HEP survey pilot studies; transect establishment guidelines, and photo documentation parameters. In contrast, specific metrics detail actual habitat variable measurement techniques including diagrams where additional explanation is needed. In cases where more than one measurement technique option is possible, options are assigned an alpha-numeric code. This allows project managers and field technicians to identify specific measurement techniques in report tables and data spreadsheets without lengthy, redundant explanations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This field techniques manual is intended to be a &ldquo;living&rdquo; document and will be modified as needed. The following standardized protocols and measurement techniques are used by the Regional HEP team to measure habitat variables described in HEP models and used in conjunction with CHAP verification transects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

  "keyAssumptions": "<p>Our key assumption is that HEP species models can be used to quantify habitat quality for individual wildlife species and species guilds.</p>\r\n",
  "dataHandlingConsiderations": "All field data is recorded on data loggers or field data forms. Data is entered into computer spreadsheets, and submitted with HEP reports for each entity. If HEP data is recorded on hard copy (i.e., paper) data sheets due to weather conditions, hard copy data sheets will also be provided to project sponsors. ",
  "qualityControlConsiderations": "Habitat variable data collection protocols are reviewed each field day. Field personnel are \"calibrated\" for spatial measurements based on team consensus methods. After field measurements are taken, field team leaders review the data to ensure the data  makes \"biological sense.\" In addition, transect photos are compared to field data results in the office to support measured data results.  Refer to the accompanying diagram for the following explanation: HEP model variable data is entered onto Allegro CE\u00ae data logger spreadsheets (1), or recorded on paper data sheets in the field (2). The raw field data (3) is downloaded from the data loggers or manually entered from paper data sheets onto computers (transect photos were also downloaded and stored on field computers). The raw data and photos are compiled for each transect into three basic products/files (4) that are provided to project managers as report appendices and/or separate CD files. \r\nProduct files include raw field data downloaded from the data loggers (5), data summary spreadsheets (6) which are the results of compiling/processing the raw data, and transect photo files (7). Summarized/processed data from each transect is applied to appropriate HEP model variables to determine suitability index (SI) ratings that are combined on habitat suitability index (HSI) spreadsheets (8) to determine the HSI for a particular HEP species model/cover type. The habitat suitability index is then multiplied by the number of cover type acres to determine the number of habitat units (9). Habitat variable data computations are reviewed by three reviewers.\r\n\r\n",
  "reportingConsiderations": "HEP survey habitat unit (HU) results must be uploaded to BPA's Pisces database along with final HEP survey reports. In addition, project sponsors and BPA COTRs receive a copy of final HEP reports along with supporting document links/folders. Reporting time frames coincide with BPA contract milestones.",
  "equipmentCleaningAndCalibration": "Vehicles are washed, including under carriage, after completing a HEP analysis on a given project site, or when moving to a different geographical location. This includes washing vehicles on weekends after returning to \"home of record\" before returning to a project site to continue HEP surveys. Team member field clothes and boots are also cleaned of seed, foliage, and other debris between projects and/or weekly whichever comes first. Equipment does not need recalibration. It is either functional or it is not.",
  "rolesAndResponsibilities": "Crew leaders are responsible for hiring, training, and materially supporting crew members, planning and executing HEP surveys, controlling data quality and storage, calculating data results, applying data results to HEP models, and drafting final HEP reports. Crew members are responsible for collecting habitat data, maintaining vehicles, and assisting with data computations and other tasks as assigned.",
  "qualifications": "Crew lead must be HEP certified, well versed in habitat variable collection methods and associated statistical analyses and plant identification; possess strong leadership, computer program and writing skills; be physically capable of participating in habitat surveys; College degree and or sufficient course work in natural resources or related field(s). Crew members should possess post high school education or a degree in natural resources or related field(s);  be physically capable of participating in habitat surveys; possess computer program and plant identification skills.",
  "trainingRequirements": "Both crew leaders and crew members should receive training in the following areas: Habitat variable measured and ocular data collection techniques; the use and care of data collection equipment/tools; cover type identification; map orientation; HEP species model requirements; and plant identification.",
  "safetyConsiderations": "All crew members should possess comfortable hiking boots, hat, weather appropriate clothing including rain gear, orange safety vest, water bottle(s) or backpack water \"camel\", intra team radio, insect spray, sunscreen etc. Crew leaders should conduct daily safety briefings that include at the minimum: expected weather conditions, project area terrain features, how to deal with potential hazards such as rattlesnakes, cliffs, lightening, encounters with large predators and hostile people, etc., time away from vehicle, first-aid kit locations, actions to take and who to contact in the event of an accident, location of vehicle key.",
  "fieldScheduleNotes": "Hire temporary field technicians attending college in January or February in order to have the largest candidate pool possible. Pre-visit project sites to determine access, learn terrain features, confirm cover types and HEP model species selection, identify special equipment needs such as mud boots etc.. Pre-package cover type/boundary maps, HEP models, and other data related forms for each project site. Conduct HEP surveys May through mid September predicated on HEP model requirements e.g., a mallard nesting HEP model survey should take place during the nesting season.",
  "budgetConsiderations": "I highly recommend using data loggers to log habitat variable data. This allows the data to be uploaded to computer spreadsheets, thus reducing time spent on calculating data results and reducing errors due to handling the data more than once. Data loggers can be expensive. Crew travel and per diem costs can also be a significant part of the budget if project areas are far from the crew's \"home of record\" or located far apart. ",
