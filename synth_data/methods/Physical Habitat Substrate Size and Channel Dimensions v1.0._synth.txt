2. Abstract: This method is derived from the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) protocol for monitoring western wadable streams. The method involves measuring stream substrate size, embeddedness, wetted width, water depth, and other physical dimensions at cross-sectional transects. Substrate size and channel dimensions are crucial in determining habitat character for fish and macroinvertebrates. This method provides a systematic approach to evaluate the effects of human activities on streams by assessing substrate characteristics as sensitive indicators of changes in upland erosion and sediment supply.

3. Description: The method is based on the EMAP protocol, which evaluates substrate size and embeddedness at cross-section transects in wadable streams using a combination of methods adapted from various sources. Substrate size is assessed at 21 cross-section transects (11 regular transects and 10 additional midway transects) by systematically selecting 5 substrate particles per transect. In addition, the wetted width of the channel and water depth at each substrate sample point are measured. If the wetted channel is split by a mid-channel bar, measurements are centered between the wetted width boundaries, regardless of the mid-channel bar in between. Substrate particles selected in some cross sections may be high and dry if the channel is entirely dry. The substrate sampling points along the cross-section are located at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of the measured wetted width.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a systematic approach for evaluating stream substrate size and channel dimensions as sensitive indicators of changes in upland erosion and sediment supply caused by human activities in western wadable streams.

5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the need for trained personnel to accurately measure stream substrate size, embeddedness, wetted width, water depth, and other physical dimensions at cross-sectional transects. Additionally, environmental conditions such as weather and water levels can impact data collection and accuracy.
