  "abstractText": "Benthic macroinvertebrate samples are taken in riffles and in created/connected slow and off-channel habitat following restoration. For both samples, a set of metrics is calculated. By comparing macroinvertebrate metrics between the habitat types, the relative production in riffle habitat can be compared to production in the created/connected slow and off-channel habitat, in order to determine if production is substantially different between the habitats.",
