2. Abstract: This method provides a simple and cost-effective way to estimate the vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) in hyporheic flow systems, which are crucial for nutrient and organic matter transport and retention in the subsurface zone. The approach is particularly relevant for understanding spawning site selection by salmonids, such as fall chinook salmon and bull trout, which prefer upwelling and downwelling areas, respectively. By measuring VHG, this method helps assess the relative strength of upwelling or downwelling subsurface flows, contributing to better management and conservation strategies for aquatic ecosystems.
3. Description: Hyporheic flow refers to the exchange between subsurface and surface waters through streambed sediment. This interaction plays a significant role in nutrient and organic matter transport and retention within the subsurface zone (Benjankar et al., 2014). The vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) is a dimensionless metric that indicates the relative strength of upwelling (positive values) or downwelling (negative values) of subsurface flows. The method described here, developed by Baxter, Hauer, and Woessner (2003), offers a simple and cost-effective technique to estimate VHG. This information is essential for understanding spawning site selection by salmonids like fall chinook salmon and bull trout. Geist (2000) found that fall chinook salmon in the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River preferred spawning in upwelling areas, while C.V. Baxter and Hauer (2000) discovered that bull trout preferred spawning at sites with localized downwelling. Measuring VHG allows for a better understanding of these preferences, leading to improved management and conservation strategies for aquatic ecosystems.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to offer a simple and cost-effective technique for estimating the vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) in hyporheic flow systems.
5. Constraints: The main constraint for this method is its applicability, as it may not be directly transferable to various aquatic systems without proper calibration and adaptation. Additionally, the reliance on specific equipment and expertise may pose challenges in certain contexts.
