2. Abstract: This text describes the primary monitoring methods used by NABat, the North American Bat Monitoring Program. The program uses two main methods for assessing bat distributions and occupancy: mist netting and acoustic surveying. Mist netting is costly, labor-intensive, and carries risks for both humans and bats, so it will not be used as part of the standard protocols for estimating trends in bat populations. However, capture data can still be submitted to the Bat Population Database (BPD) for interpretation alongside acoustic and colony count data. Acoustic surveying is a safer and more feasible option for large-scale monitoring, and NABat uses two approaches: stationary point surveys and mobile transects. These methods involve using bat detectors to record and analyze bat calls, which can be used to identify species or species groups.
3. Description: The text begins by discussing the limitations of mist netting as a monitoring method for bats. Mist netting is costly, labor-intensive, and carries risks for both humans and bats. Additionally, there are many biases associated with mist netting, such as placement bias, species avoidance, and environmental conditions. Data from mist netting is also limited to presence/absence data and some demographic information. However, capture data can still be submitted to the BPD for interpretation alongside acoustic and colony count data. The text then goes on to describe NABat's primary monitoring methods: stationary point surveys and mobile transects. Stationary point surveys involve placing bat detectors at various features across the landscape for multiple nights, while mobile transects involve driving slowly along a predetermined route with a fixed bat detector. Resulting call files are identified to species or species group using at least two methods. Response variables include detection/nondetection of each species and the number of bat passes per species along a given transect for mobile transects. Stationary point surveys provide indices of activity that may be valuable indicators in future analyses. Mobile transects are more cost-effective than stationary point surveys and may be easier to implement in areas dominated by private land, but they carry the risk of road bias and underrepresentation of certain species. Stationary point surveys remove this road bias but require more time to deploy and may be difficult to find sites in areas primarily in private ownership.
4. Target: The primary focus or goal of the method is to monitor bat distributions and occupancy using safe and feasible methods for large-scale monitoring programs.
5. Constraints: The constraints for the current method include cost, labor intensity, human and bat safety risks, biases associated with mist netting, limitations of data from mist netting, habitat sampling limitations, disease transmission risk, and injury or stress to bats. Additionally, mobile transects may carry road bias and underrepresentation of certain species, while stationary point surveys require more time to deploy and may be difficult to find sites in areas primarily in private ownership.
