"Based on the provided keywords and considering the context of all the documents, here's a suggested comprehensive ontology for the given information:
1. **Fish**
    - Fish populations (anadromous fish, salmonids)
    - Fish species identification and classification (e.g., White sturgeon)
    - Fish behavior and migration patterns
   
2. **Aquaculture and Fisheries** <- Fix that Mistral
    These should be at number 6:
        - Telemetry using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags for fish tracking
        - Stock assessment studies and mark-recapture methods   
        - Marking, tagging, and handling procedures for fish   
    Generic:
        - Research on fishing effort estimation (angler surveys, roving crews, offsite surveys)

3. **Effects of Dams on Aquatic Ecosystems**
    - Reductions in spawning habitat for fish species
    - Impact on native prey abundance due to dam construction and operation
    - Effects on genetic diversity and population fragmentation
    - Changes or modifications to hydropower systems for fish recruitment (e.g., white sturgeon)
    - Blockage of historical migration patterns for various fish species

4. **Habitat and Water Quality**
    - Preferred spawning, rearing, and overwintering habitat conditions for different fish populations
    - Availability and quality of instream and riparian habitats in impounded reaches (e.g., vegetation coverage, woody debris)
    - Monitoring of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and other water quality parameters
    
5. **Fish Biology**
    - Fish age estimation methods using otoliths or scales
    - Genetic population structure assessment (e.g., for white sturgeon, salmonids)
    - Migration and gene flow between populations
    - Effective population size analysis (number of breeding adults)

6. **Research and Monitoring Methods**
    - Transect-based methods for measuring substrate characteristics and human influence in riparian zones
    - Ecosystem surveys using field measurements, remote sensing, and statistical analyses
    - Collection and analysis of eDNA samples
    - Sampling designs (spatial and temporal) for fishery research

7. **Fisheries Management**
    - Implementation of fish passage criteria to support upstream fish migration
    - Assessment and evaluation of fish passage systems, such as fish ladders or weirs
    - Enhancement programs and stock assessment studies for various fish populations

8. **Impacts on Aquatic Ecosystems**
    - Monitoring changes in species composition and community structure due to dam construction and operation
    - Evaluation of potential impacts on food webs, energy flow, and trophic cascades in aquatic ecosystems
    - Research on long-term effects of dams on biodiversity and ecosystem function."
