 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the five highly relevant keywords that I have identified from the text body:

1. Fish passage criteria
2. Engineered fish passage solutions
3. Water Crossing Design Guidelines
4. Fish passage structure evaluation
5. Monitoring and assessment of fish passage

Now, let me provide a response for each of the requested sections:

2. Abstract:
This method outlines the importance of evaluating engineered fish passage solutions to ensure that they remain viable for at least five years after construction. The approach uses natural stream channels as a benchmark and measures the effectiveness of the completed passage structure based on its compliance with design criteria, including gradient measurements. Monitoring project design upon completion and over time is crucial to assessing the method's success.
3. Description:
The text body provides information about a method used to determine whether designed fish passage criteria are met post-construction. The purpose of this method is to ensure that an engineered solution to a fish passage problem remains viable for at least five years. Natural stream channels serve as the benchmark for fish passage, and deviations from the prevailing natural condition can impair fish passage. Compliance with design criteria measures the effectiveness of the completed passage structure, while gradient measurements are used to assess compliance. The Water Crossing Design Guidelines provided by WDFW are used to design new stream crossing structures and restore fish passage at identified barriers. Monitoring project design upon completion and over time constitutes an appropriate and measurable effectiveness monitoring method. Evaluating adult and juvenile fish densities is necessary to assess whether partial fish passage barriers have been improved.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to ensure that engineered fish passage solutions remain viable for at least five years after construction by evaluating their compliance with design criteria and monitoring their performance over time.
5. Constraints:
The constraints for this method include the need for accurate design criteria, appropriate measurement tools, and ongoing monitoring and assessment of fish passage structures. Additionally, measuring deviations in gradient that are greater than 20% is necessary to assess compliance with design criteria. Finally, evaluating adult and juvenile fish densities is critical to assessing whether partial fish passage barriers have been improved.
