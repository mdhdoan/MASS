 Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize and analyze the text you provided. Here are the keywords I identified as being most relevant to the method described:

1. Fish migration guidance structures
2. Video-equipped counting chambers
3. Time-lapse photography
4. Infrared and visible light imaging
5. Artificial light usage

Now, let's move on to the other sections you requested:

2. Abstract: This method describes the use of specially designed fish migration guidance structures to help facilitate the safe passage of adult salmon through a channel. The guidance structures include tripod-supported upstream and downstream guide fences that are connected to video-equipped counting chambers. These chambers use time-lapse photography and infrared and visible light imaging to capture images of individual salmon as they pass through the channel. The images are recorded on 8mm videotape and used for monitoring and counting purposes. Artificial light is used to ensure that clear images are captured even in low-light conditions.
3. Description: The method involves the use of tripod-supported upstream and downstream guide fences, which are connected to video-equipped counting chambers. Support brackets are attached to a tripod leg to support the picket stringers, which are constructed of 1/4 inch aluminum angle with one inch diameter holes punched two inches on center. One inch galvanized pickets are installed in the stringers after the tripods, support brackets, and stringers are set in their final positions. The downstream guide fence is installed at a 30 to 45 degree (upstream) angle to the bank, while the upstream guide fence is similarly angled to the bank (downstream) to allow unimpeded downstream adult fish movement and movement of other fish species such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The counting chamber is installed in the channel thalweg, which is anticipated to be the preferred adult salmon migration corridor. Photographs of individual salmon are taken through a clear plexiglas window mounted on the lower half of the counting chamber on the near side. The video camera is an ultra-high resolution monochrome CCD camera that images infrared and visible light and is sealed in a waterproof housing. Fish images are recorded in time-lapse (2 frames/sec) on 8mm videotape. Recording will occur continuously while the count station is operated. Artificial light is used to ensure adequate lighting conditions for image capture.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to facilitate the safe passage of adult salmon through a channel, while also allowing for monitoring and counting purposes.
5. Constraints: One constraint of this method is the need for adequate lighting conditions to ensure that clear images are captured. This is addressed by using artificial light to supplement natural light when necessary. Another constraint may be the need for regular maintenance and upkeep of the guidance structures, such as ensuring that the pickets remain securely in place and that the counting chambers remain free of debris. Additionally, the method requires a significant amount of technical expertise to set up and operate the video-equipped counting chambers and to analyze the resulting images.
