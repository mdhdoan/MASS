2. Abstract: Stomach lavage sampling is a non-lethal method used to analyze the diet of live, anesthetized fish. This technique, which removes up to 98.9% of gut contents, has been successfully employed on salmonids and sculpins larger than specific length requirements. The process involves dislodging any visible food particles from the mouth, followed by multiple water pulses to induce regurgitation. The method has minimal impact on fish survival and condition, allowing for accurate diet description and correlation with available invertebrate communities.
3. Description: Stomach lavage sampling is a detailed process used for gut contents analysis in live, anesthetized fish. To begin, fish are anesthetized following Method #5356, ensuring safe handling and minimal stress. Forceps are then utilized to remove any visible food remnants from the mouth. The primary focus of this method is to study fish diet (Northington & Hershey 2006) and foraging habits by correlating them with the available invertebrate community. This technique has been shown to extract up to 98.9% of gut contents while causing little harm to the fish's subsequent survival and condition (Strange & Kennedy 1981; Waters, Kwak et al. 2004). Successful application of this method requires adherence to size limitations: salmonids must have a fork length greater than 80mm, and sculpins need a total length exceeding 65mm.
4. Target: The primary goal of the stomach lavage sampling method is to analyze fish gut contents for dietary assessment and foraging habit correlation while minimizing negative impacts on fish survival and condition.
5. Constraints: This method requires specialized equipment, such as anesthetics and forceps, and demands a certain level of expertise in handling live fish. Additionally, applicability is limited to salmonids with fork lengths greater than 80mm and sculpins larger than 65mm total length. The use of this method should adhere to ethical guidelines for animal research, ensuring no mortality associated with the lavage sampling process.
