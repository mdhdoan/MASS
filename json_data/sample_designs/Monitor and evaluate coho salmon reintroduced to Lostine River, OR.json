  "description": "<p>This sample design refers to the monitoring and sampling of coho salmon associated with the Lostine River reintroduction effort (NPT).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We intend to perform redd surveys along the Lostine River, and tissue sample post-spawned carcass samples when possible, to map the spawning riverscape of coho salmon reintroduced to the Grande Ronde basin. Redd surveys will be expanded into nearby tributaries as time and personnel allow. Surveys will allow for identification of&nbsp;highly productive reaches and data will be&nbsp;uploaded to the Grande Ronde Model Watershed and mapped alongside already collected data, such as chinook redd surveys, to better visualize habitat usage, inter-species interaction and ecosystem-scale effects of this reintroduction effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also intend to analyze Coded Wire Tag (CWT) data to estimate contribution to harvest, smolt-to-adult survival and stray rates. A proportion of the smolt releases have received a CWT since program initiation in 2017, and these tag codes can be compared to records in CWT recovery databases, such as RMIS, to estimate harvest and map movement in the basin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
