  "abstractText": "Beach and pole seining can be an efficient method to capture fishes in a wide variety of habitats, including rivers, estuarine, and nearshore lake, reservoir, and marine habitats (Pierce et al. 1990). It is most effective when used in relatively shallow water with few obstructions, where fish are in high concentrations, and for species that are less likely to outswim the net; however, in some circumstances seining can capture highly mobile species such as adult salmon. Seining permits the sampling of relatively large areas in short periods of time as well as the capture and release of fish without significant stress or harm, as long as the bunt of the seine is kept in water and the fish are not too crowded (or fish are quickly moved to a holding container). Cost of gear, boats, and personnel range from relatively inexpensive to modest, depending on the scope and frequency of sampling.Seining may be carried out in a variety of habitat types, depending on the population and life stage of the targeted species. Sites with irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, or dense stands of aquatic vegetation may not be suitable for seining due to net snagging or lifting and reduced fish retention. Current velocity and depth influence site selection and choice of net design. Seines vary in size and design. To help understand what affects selectivity and capture efficiencyand therefore, effectiveness of seiningwe considered the following categories: habitat, water, fish, time of year and day, net, and method. Considering these factors in your study design before you sample and after you begin sampling (by underwater observation and calibration studies) will help you to decide when seining may be a good technique to meet your objectives; it will also help improve the analysis of data collected.Rectangular arc set beach seining may be used for fish/set, fish/area, or fish/volume analysis (note: length, width, and depth must be measured). This method is probably one of the most consistent and accurate for calculating area and volume. Works best for small fish that are not greatly alarmed by persons wading and that do not escape from the slowly set net.",
