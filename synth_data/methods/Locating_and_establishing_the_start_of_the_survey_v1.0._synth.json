  "abstract": " In order to effectively collect water samples from various watersheds, a topographic map of each watershed is used as a guide. The map comes with potential sampling sites marked. This method is necessary because it ensures that all necessary sites are visited during the survey process and helps in efficient planning and execution of the sampling mission.\n\nThe sites are selected in numerical order, skipping those which cannot be sampled for various reasons, such as lack of access or environmental concerns. For watershed re-surveys, existing survey sites will be visited again in numerical order from the lowest to the highest numbered site. If new sites need to be added due to changes in the watershed or other factors, they are selected in numerical order, starting with number 1.\n\nThis method is important because it provides a clear and consistent approach for sampling across different watersheds. It also helps maintain data consistency over time, as existing sites are visited repeatedly and new sites are added systematically. This systematic approach to water sampling solves potential issues related to missing or inconsistent data and ensures that a comprehensive and accurate dataset is collected.\n\nCode generation: I'm an assistant designed for labeling topics and providing explanations. I don't generate code as part of my function. However, here's a simple pseudocode example of how the method could be implemented:\n\n```python\ndef watershed_sampling(watershed_map):\n    # initialize variables\n    surveyed_sites = []\n    potential_sites = watershed_map['potential_sites']\n    current_site = 0\n    \n    while len(surveyed_sites) < num_required_samples:\n        site = potential_sites[current_site]\n        \n        # check if the site can be sampled\n        if can_sample(site):\n            surveyed_sites.append(site)\n            current_site += 1\n        else:\n            current_site += 1\n            \n    return surveyed_sites\n```"

  "description": " In accordance with the provided text, I will describe the process for selecting sampling sites based on a topographic map and adhering to the specified numbering system. This technique is utilized for watershed studies, where each watershed is assigned a unique topographic map marked with potential sampling sites.\n\nThe first step involves reviewing the map and identifying viable sampling sites based on accessibility and suitability for water collection. Sites that cannot be accessed or have other limitations preventing proper sampling are excluded from consideration.\n\nFor repeat surveys of watersheds, the original survey sites will be revisited in numerical order from the lowest to the highest numbered site. This sequential approach allows for consistent data collection and comparison between surveys.\n\nShould additional sites need to be added, new sites will be chosen in numerical order starting with number 1, regardless of whether any previously surveyed sites already exist at higher numbers. By following this method, we ensure a systematic and organized approach to collecting water samples within the watersheds."

  "constraints": " Based on the provided text, the following constraints apply to the method of selecting sample sites for watershed surveys:\n\n1. Sites are selected in numerical order. This is stated multiple times in the text, specifically \"Select sites in numerical order,\" \"survey sites will be repeated in numerical order,\" and \"If additional sites need to be added, select sites in numerical order.\"\n2. Sites that cannot be sampled are omitted. This is not explicitly stated in the text, but it can be inferred from the phrase \"omitting sites that cannot be sampled.\" It's likely that some sites may have restrictions or limitations that make them impossible to sample, and these sites should be skipped.\n3. Re-survey sites are surveyed in numerical order from lowest to highest number. This is stated as \"For watershed re-surveys, survey sites will be repeated in numerical order from lowest to highest number.\" It's not clear why the sites need to be surveyed in this particular order, but it may be for logistical reasons or to ensure consistency with past surveys.\n4. New sites are added in numerical order, starting with number 1. This is stated as \"If additional sites need to be added, select sites in numerical order, starting with number 1.\" It's not clear why new sites need to be added in this particular order, but it may be for consistency or to ensure that all sites are surveyed systematically.\n\nThere is no code provided in the text."
