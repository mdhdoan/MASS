 1. Keywords: Macroinvertebrate sampling, Hess sampler, electrofishing, benthic macroinvertebrates, lotic systems.
2. Abstract: This method presents a novel approach to sampling and evaluating macroinvertebrate abundance, composition, and community structure in freshwater ecosystems. By utilizing a customized Hess sampler and a localized field of direct current via a backpack electrofisher unit, benthic macroinvertebrates are efficiently collected while minimizing organic and inorganic debris typically associated with traditional methods. This method provides density and diversity estimates comparable to conventional techniques and offers a cleaner sample for further analysis.
3. Description: The text describes a new method that employs an electrofishing technique for sampling benthic macroinvertebrates, which are essential indicators of the health and productivity of freshwater ecosystems (Hauer & Resh, 2006). This approach combines a customized Hess sampler with a backpack electrofisher unit, inducing macroinvertebrates into the drift through exposure to electricity. Compared to traditional methods like Surber, Hess, and D-frame kick net samplers, this technique yields density and diversity estimates of comparable quality while producing cleaner samples with significantly reduced organic and inorganic debris. The reduction in substrate disturbance results in a less contaminated sample, facilitating subsequent analysis and evaluation.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to enhance macroinvertebrate sampling efficiency and accuracy by minimizing substrate disturbance and associated debris while maintaining the quality of density and diversity estimates.
5. Constraints: This method requires access to specialized equipment, such as a customized Hess sampler and a backpack electrofisher unit, which may not be readily available or cost-effective for all users. Additionally, users must have proper training in handling and operating electrofishing equipment to ensure safety and ethical considerations when working with aquatic life.
