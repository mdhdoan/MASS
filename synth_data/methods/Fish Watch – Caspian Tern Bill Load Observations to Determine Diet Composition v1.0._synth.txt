2. Abstract: The method described in this text focuses on collecting fish watch data for Caspian terns at their breeding colonies. By observing the types of fish brought back to the colony by adults, researchers can determine the taxonomic composition of the diet. This information is crucial for understanding the feeding habits and ecological role of Caspian terns in their ecosystem. Additionally, the collected data can be used to calculate total fish consumption through bioenergetics modeling.
3. Description: The method involves observing Caspian terns as they return to their breeding colonies with fish in their bills (referred to as bill loads). Data on the types of prey taxa in the diet is collected during the breeding season, which typically lasts from April through August. The text also mentions that data from fish watch observations can be used for bioenergetics modeling to determine fish consumption by bird colonies. Specific details about the methods used at the Caspian tern colony on East Sand Island in the Columbia River estuary are provided.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to investigate the diet composition of Caspian terns and calculate the total number of fish consumed during their breeding season.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include the limited time frame of the breeding season, as well as the need for direct observation of adults returning to the colony with fish. Additionally, successful data collection may be impacted by weather conditions and the behavior of the terns themselves.
