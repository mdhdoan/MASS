2. Abstract:
The method calculates reach level percent dry using channel morphology data, which serves as a single value summary of various stream reach attributes. This approach provides an efficient way to understand and analyze the characteristics of watercourses, facilitating decision-making processes in water resource management.

3. Description:
Channel morphology data is used to calculate reach level percent dry, indicating the proportion of time that a stream segment remains without surface water. Reach level is a comprehensive summary of multiple attributes for each stream reach, allowing for a simplified representation of the complex system. The method calculates this value based on dry periods and can be applied in various water resource management scenarios to assess conditions and inform appropriate actions.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the method is to determine reach level percent dry using channel morphology data, offering a quick reference for stream reach attributes.

5. Constraints:
There are no explicit constraints mentioned in the text body; however, the method's applicability may depend on factors such as data availability and accuracy, geographic location, and seasonal variations in water flow rates.
