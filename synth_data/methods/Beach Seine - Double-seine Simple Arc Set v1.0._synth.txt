2. Abstract: Beach seining is an efficient fish capture method applicable to various habitats like rivers, estuaries, lakes, and marine environments. It's cost-effective and allows for large-scale sampling with minimal stress on captured fishes. However, careful consideration of habitat suitability, water conditions, targeted fish species, time, net design, and seining method is necessary to optimize its effectiveness and avoid damage to the fishing gear (Pierce et al., 1990).
3. Description: Beach seining involves using a long net to encircle fish in shallow waters. Its efficiency relies on suitable habitats with minimal obstructions, favorable water conditions, high fish concentrations, and species less likely to outswim the net. Seining can even capture mobile species like adult salmon under specific circumstances. It's essential to consider factors such as bottom topography, debris, aquatic vegetation, current velocity, and depth when selecting a site for seining (Pierce et al., 1990).

The size and design of seines vary, impacting selectivity and capture efficiency. Double-seine simple arc set beach seining is a fast-pursuit method suitable for tagging and releasing fish, though not recommended for CPUE analysis. Proper gear, boats, and personnel are required, with costs ranging from inexpensive to modest depending on sampling scope and frequency (Pierce et al., 1990).
4. Target: Optimizing fish capture efficiency using beach seining while minimizing damage to fishing gear.
5. Constraints: Successful beach seining relies on careful consideration of various factors, including habitat suitability, water conditions, targeted species, time, net design, and seining method. Identifying irregular bottom topography, significant accumulations of debris or larger rocks, dense aquatic vegetation, high current velocity, or deep waters can hinder efficient seining, necessitating careful planning and adaptable strategies to achieve optimal results.
