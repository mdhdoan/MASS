  "background": "Rufus Woods Lake is an 82 km long run-of-the-river reservoir on the Columbia River that was formed by the construction of Chief Joseph Dam. Currently, the dam has no fish ladders and blocks upstream fish passage. Grand Coulee Dam forms the upstream end of Rufus Woods Lake.In 1996, the Colville Tribes, working with Columbia River Fish Farms (an aquaculture facility on Rufus Woods Lake) began a fish release program using Tribal funds to supplement the Rufus Woods Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fishery. The current Washington State record Rainbow Trout was caught in Rufus Woods Lake in 2002 (29.6 lbs). In 2007 and 2008 there were more than 40,000 angler days spent fishing in Rufus Woods annually, making Rufus Woods the most popular fishing destination on the Colville Reservation. The current Rainbow Trout daily bag limit is two. The reservoir also contains other sport fish including Walleye (Sander vitreus), Kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka), Burbot (Lota lota), Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu), and Brown Trout (Salmo trutta).Previous years' preliminary creel data suggest the trophy fishery and catch rates were maintained at artificially high levels due to excessive fish escapement from the aquaculture net pens located within Rufus Woods Lake and not from the Colville Tribes' fish purchases and stocking efforts (Shallenberger 2009). In early 2014, one of the two aquaculture facilities on Rufus Woods Lake shutdown. The other facility has greatly reduced its fish escapement and excess feed drift. As a result, the few bigger Rainbow Trout released by the Tribes' have been unable to sustain historically high catch rates of trophy fish. Additional studies were conducted to investigate the potential of supplementing the fishery with many smaller Rainbow Trout that could grow within the lake. However, the majority of Rainbow Trout released only occupied Rufus Woods Lake for one month because of harvest, entrainment and other unidentified causes, making growth of smaller fish to trophy size unlikely (Brown et al. 2011). Diet and secondary production studies also indicated insufficient food resources are incorporated into Rainbow Trout diets to produce an adequate trophy fishery (Richards et al. 2011).For these reasons, the goal of the fishery has shifted from a trophy-only fishery to a combined catchable and trophy fishery. To achieve this goal, the release consist of approximately 67% large catchable Rainbow Trout (~0.45 kg per fish, >400 mm total length) to maintain higher catch rates of quality size fish, and approximately 33% larger fish (~15,000 trout at ~>1.5 kg per fish) to provide the opportunity to catch memorable-trophy size Rainbow Trout (size categories based on Brouder et al. 2009).In order to provide information on the fishery for optimal management, the Colville Tribes has conducted a detailed creel study since 2007. These protocols have been changed overtime to reflect changes in the fishery (usage and site access locations), project budget, and personnel constraints.",
