  "background": "Annual redd counts for summer/fall Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) are conducted throughout many river systemsin Washington state. Redd count data are combined with additional information (e.g. spawner sex-ratio, hatchery-wild composition) to monitor the status and trends of Chinook species.",

  "assumptions": "<p>Redds are created by a single female Chinook.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Female Chinook create only a single redd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Redds are observable by survey crews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Redds are counted with reasonable accuracy (i.e. minimal double-counting, under-counting, over-counting)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sex-ratio (which is combined with redd count data to estimate spawner abundance) obtained from passage observations at Well Dam is representative of the sex-ratio on Okanogan Basin spawning grounds (Okanogan and Similkameen Rivers)</p>\r\n",
