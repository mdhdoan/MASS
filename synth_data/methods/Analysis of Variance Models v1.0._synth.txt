 1. Keywords: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Parametric statistical test, Experimental design, Fixed/random effects, Model error.
2. Abstract: The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model is a parametric statistical test used to make inferences about the means of different populations. Its use is widespread in various fields such as fish and macroinvertebrate studies. ANOVA models require the user to specify alpha level and whether the variables are fixed or random effects, offering many customization options to suit specific analysis plans. Adhering to the assumptions associated with its use ensures valid results.
3. Description: The text provides an in-depth overview of the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model, a widely used parametric statistical test for making inferences about population means. ANOVA models take various forms depending on experimental design and require users to specify alpha level and fixed/random effects. Users can customize ANOVA models to meet their analysis plan needs. It is crucial that users understand and adhere to the assumptions associated with its use. The traditional form of an ANOVA model includes a response variable, intercept, main effect (covariate), and model error.
4. Target: The primary focus of the ANOVA method is to allow researchers to make inferences about the means of different populations based on statistical analysis.
5. Constraints: Proper specification of alpha level and fixed/random effects are necessary for the accurate use of an ANOVA model, as well as adherence to its associated assumptions.
