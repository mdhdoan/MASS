  "abstract": " This text describes a method used to study the impact of habitat actions on the population of native summer steelhead in the Upper Grande Ronde River Subbasin. The protocol involves counting all redds (nests where salmon lay their eggs) in selected areas, ensuring each redd is counted only once, and using accurate GPS coordinates. Additionally, the method aims to estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of redds, as well as the number of spawning females and native summer steelhead spawners over time.\n\nThe necessity of this method lies in understanding how habitat conditions influence the abundance and distribution of native summer steelhead. By accurately counting and tracking redds, researchers can gather crucial data about the population size and trends, providing valuable insights for conservation efforts and habitat management strategies. This information helps address issues related to habitat degradation, loss, or fragmentation that may impact the survival and reproduction of this important fish species.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no code in the text provided."

  "description": " The provided text describes a protocol used for assessing the impact of habitat actions on the population of native summer steelhead in the Upper Grande Ronde River Subbasin. The primary objectives of this study include estimating the temporal and spatial distribution of redds (spawning sites), determining the number of spawning females, and estimating the numbers of native summer steelhead spawners over a given period.\n\nTo execute this protocol, all redds constructed in predetermined reaches are systematically counted to ensure each one is accounted for only once, utilizing accurate redd/female ratios and precise GPS coordinates. The temporal distribution of redds is estimated by determining the time period during which each redd was occupied for spawning purposes. This can be done through various methods such as examining the age of the fish eggs present in the redd or analyzing historical data on steelhead spawning patterns.\n\nThe spatial distribution of redds is assessed by identifying their locations within the studied subbasin. Each redd is plotted on a map and its environmental characteristics are recorded, including factors such as water temperature, substrate type, flow velocity, and proximity to other redds. This information can help inform habitat management efforts and identify areas where additional conservation measures may be necessary.\n\nThe number of spawning females is estimated by counting the total number of redds observed during the assessment period and multiplying it by an average number of females per redd based on historical data or previous studies. Additionally, the size and condition of the eggs within each redd can provide insights into female reproductive success and overall fish health.\n\nLastly, to estimate the numbers of native summer steelhead spawners over time, longitudinal monitoring and analysis of redd data is conducted. By tracking changes in the number and distribution of redds year over year, trends and patterns can be identified that inform conservation efforts and help managers adapt to changing environmental conditions.\n\nIn summary, this protocol utilizes detailed surveys and data collection methods to estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of redds, determine the number of spawning females, and assess the population trends of native summer steelhead in the Upper Grande Ronde River Subbasin."
