2. Abstract: The text discusses two methods for measuring discharge in a stream or river. The constant-rate-injection method is preferred due to its accuracy and efficiency compared to the sudden-injection method. This method involves using a tracer, such as dye or common salt, and analyzing concentration-time curves to determine discharge. However, the use of dye in the sudden-injection method is not practical due to the large number of samples required and the lack of precision provided by recording fluorometers. Instead, conductivity readings can be obtained quickly and precisely using a temperature-compensated probe and portable meter when salt is used as a tracer.

3. Description: The text compares two methods for measuring stream discharge: the constant-rate-injection method and the sudden-injection method. The constant-rate-injection method is preferred due to its accuracy, with the recommendation that grab samples be obtained at all three sampling points in the cross section within a minute or so during periods of rapidly changing concentration. At least 20 samples should be taken at each sampling point to define the concentration-time curve, resulting in a minimum of 60 stream samples analyzed by fluorometer. However, the sudden-injection method is considered less accurate and more laborious, particularly when using dye as a tracer. The text explains that it is not practical to use dye in this method due to the large number of samples required and the lack of precision provided by recording fluorometers. In contrast, conductivity readings can be obtained quickly and precisely using a temperature-compensated probe and portable meter when salt is used as a tracer.

4. Target: The primary focus of the method described in the text is to accurately measure stream discharge using a tracer and concentration-time curves.

5. Constraints: The constraints for the current method include the need for accurate and precise measurement tools, such as fluorometers or temperature-compensated probes and portable meters, and the availability of a suitable tracer, such as dye or common salt. Additionally, the constant-rate-injection method requires careful sampling and analysis to ensure accurate results.
