2. Abstract: The text describes a method called passive angling, which involves using baited set lines to catch fish. This approach allows anglers to selectively target specific species, such as catfish, while minimizing the capture of other unwanted species. Compared to active angling methods, passive angling requires less effort and gear setup can be customized based on the targeted species and preferred bait or lures.
3. Description: Passive angling is a fishing method that relies on using baited set lines to catch fish. The text highlights that there is no standard setup for gear, as the size of the set line and hook will vary depending on the species being targeted. Additionally, different baits and lures may be used to attract specific types of fish. Stationary gears can be particularly effective for catching certain species like channel catfish. The advantage of passive angling with baited set lines is that it allows anglers to target specific species more effectively than other methods, while minimizing the catch of incidental species.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to enable efficient and selective fishing for targeted fish species through the use of passive angling techniques and customized gear setups.
5. Constraints: The constraints for this method include knowledge about the target fish species and their preferred baits/lures, as well as local regulations regarding the use of passive angling methods and limits on catch sizes or numbers.
