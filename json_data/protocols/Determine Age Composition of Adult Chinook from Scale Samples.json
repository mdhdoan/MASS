  "background": "Scales are collected from natural-origin adult broodstock to determine the age structure of the brood that are propagated for the Chief Joseph Hatchery integrated program. Samples are sent to a lab on scale cards with appropriate biological information (species, date, length, mark, status). Results for individual fish will includeage and natural (wild) or hatchery classification.A summary of the results will inform hatchery managers on the age composition of hatchery broodstock and performance standards for the integrated program.",
