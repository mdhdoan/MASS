 1. Abstract: This text outlines a protocol for estimating the abundance of mountain whitefish, rainbow trout, and largescale suckers in the Kootenai River to inform management decisions and evaluate population trends. The study area is a 3km reach affected by nutrient-additions, and mark-recapture methods are used to estimate populations while considering various assumptions.
2. Values, Statements, and Outcomes: Values include the importance of preserving and managing fish populations in the Kootenai River. The problem statement is the decline in resident fish populations due to anthropogenic activities and the need to understand population trends. Desired outcomes include better management decisions based on population estimates and an evaluation of the ecosystem restoration project's success.
3. Description: This text details a mark-recapture methodology for estimating fish populations in the Kootenai River, focusing on the 3km reach affected by nutrient-additions. The study area is representative and inclusive of all habitat types. Various assumptions are considered to ensure accurate population estimates, such as no new individuals entering or leaving the study area, equal catchability for each individual, sufficient time between marking and recapture periods, and no effects on survival, migration, reproduction, or mark loss.
4. Objectives: The objective is to estimate the abundance of specific fish species in the Kootenai River and evaluate population trends over time. This objective covers the entire problem statement by providing a solution for understanding the status of respective species populations relative to induced and naturally occurring changes in the river. Keywords include mark-recapture, mountain whitefish, rainbow trout, largescale suckers, Kootenai River, and population trends.
5. Target: The primary focus is estimating fish populations in the Kootenai River to inform management decisions and evaluate the ecosystem restoration project's success.
6. Constraints: Constraints for this protocol may include limited resources (financial, personnel, or time), challenges associated with mark-recapture methodologies (e.g., ensuring accurate marking and recapturing of individuals), and potential limitations in the assumptions made about fish populations within the study area.
