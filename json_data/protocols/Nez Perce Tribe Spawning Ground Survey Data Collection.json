  "background": "The Nez Perce Tribe's Department of Fisheries Resources Management utilize spawning ground surveys to gather information from returning anadromous adult salmonids (e.g. Chinook salmon, steelhead, Coho salmon). Information is used for life history, abundance and productivity monitoring in the Snake River Basin. Data are utilized for hatchery effectiveness and status and trends evaluations. Population status and trend monitoring of natural and hatchery origin fish is used for effective population management, assessing effectiveness of conservation actions, viability, and recovery metric monitoring.Please see protocols #2246, #2249 and #2250 for data analysis methods describing the calculation of metrics and indicators.",

  "assumptions": "<p style=\"margin-left:1.0in\">1. All redds are enumerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:1.0in\">2. Females build one redd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:1.0in\">3. Carcasses are collected randomly and represent the unobserved individuals.</p>\r\n",
  "objectives": [
    "Obtain an index of spawner abundance (i.e. observed redds)",
    "Determine spatial distribution of spawners",
    "Determine temporal distribution of spawners",
    "Obtain life history characteristics of spawners (i.e. age, sex, origin)",
    "Recover carcasses for genetic studies",
    "Recover carcasses for mark/recapture studies"
