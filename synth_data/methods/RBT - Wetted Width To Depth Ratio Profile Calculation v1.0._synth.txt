 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the keywords I've identified from the text body:

1. RBT (River Bathymetry Toolkit)
2. GIS tools
3. High resolution DEMs (Digital Elevation Models)
4. LiDAR
5. Profile metrics

Now, let's move on to the other sections:

2. Abstract: The River Bathymetry Toolkit (RBT) is a suite of GIS tools designed for use within ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software. The RBT allows users to describe and measure river channels using high resolution DEMs derived from airborne remote sensing such as LiDAR, or from ground-based topographic surveys. Profile metrics are calculated at regular intervals down the length of the site, providing valuable data on the shape and characteristics of the river channel. This information can be used to analyze changes in river morphology over time, and to support river management and conservation efforts.
3. Description: The RBT is a collection of GIS tools that work within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop software for describing and measuring river channels using high resolution DEMs. These DEMs can be obtained from airborne remote sensing techniques such as LiDAR, or from ground-based topographic surveys. Profile metrics are calculated at regular intervals down the length of the site, with the interval distance customizable. Each profile metric comprises several output values, including mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for all profile values, as well as filtered mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for a subset of the profile intervals. Filtering removes any values from the population that are more than a set number of standard deviations from the population mean, helping to exclude outliers from the metrics. The RBT is used in conjunction with the CHaMP Topographic Point Collection Methods, which provide background on the collection of the measurement data that are analyzed for this calculation.
4. Target: The primary goal of the RBT is to provide a tool for describing and measuring river channels using high resolution DEMs, allowing users to calculate profile metrics at regular intervals down the length of the site.
5. Constraints: One constraint of the RBT is that it requires high-quality DEM data as input, which can be obtained from airborne remote sensing techniques such as LiDAR or from ground-based topographic surveys. Additionally, the accuracy and reliability of the profile metrics depend on the quality and resolution of the DEMs used.
