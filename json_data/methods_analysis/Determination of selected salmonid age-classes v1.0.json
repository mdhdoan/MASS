  "abstractText": "The number of selected salmonid age classesreflects the suitability and stability of conditionsfor spawning, rearing, and maturation. Stressors (exploitation, recruitment failure, food limitation, niche shifts) often cause a shift in age-class distributions. The method refers to selected salmonids because it focuses on theredd building, gravel-spawning species, such as Chinook and steelhead. This metric is also used to develop an index for biotic integrity (IBI) applicable to fish assemblages in coldwater riversthroughout the Pacific Northwest.",
