2. Abstract: The McNeil Core sampling method, introduced in 1964, is a crucial technique for quantitatively measuring subsurface fine sediments in aquatic environments. These fine sediments are often missed by other sampling methods like pebble counts. Riffles, which are essential fish spawning habitats, are targeted in this method since the amount of fine sediment in the substrate significantly influences them. Lab processing, such as sieving, is necessary to determine the fine sediment fraction in McNeil Core samples accurately.
3. Description: The McNeil Core sampling method, which was developed in 1964, is a specialized approach for quantitatively measuring subsurface fine sediments that might be overlooked by other sampling methods like pebble counts. Fine sediments are of particular importance in riffle habitats, as they can impact fish spawning. In order to accurately determine the fraction of fine sediment in McNeil Core samples, lab processing (such as sieving) is required. This process allows for a more precise understanding of the amount and distribution of fine sediments within the substrate, providing valuable insights for environmental monitoring and management efforts.
4. Target: The primary focus of the McNeil Core sampling method is to quantitatively measure subsurface fine sediments in aquatic environments, specifically targeting riffle habitats that are critical for fish spawning.
5. Constraints: To ensure accurate results, lab processing (such as sieving) is required for McNeil Core samples. This necessitates access to laboratory facilities and trained personnel, adding time and resources to the overall sampling process.
