  "abstractText": "Amphibians are important components of ecosystem biodiversity that are frequently overlooked by fish and wildlife habitat managers. In recent decades there has been worldwide concern about declines in populations of amphibians (Blaustein et al. 2011, Liu et al. 2013). Factors such as pollution, habitat loss, competition from exotics species, infectious disease, and climate change have all played a role in these declines. Permeable skin and a life cycle that involves both aquatic and terrestrial habitats make amphibians especially susceptible to altered environmental conditions. They can serve as indicators of environmental health (DeGarady and Halbrook 2006) and directional change due to management efforts (Vasconcelos and Calhoun 2006).Local management activities may disproportionately affect amphibians (and reptiles) because they are relatively sedentary in contrast to larger mammals and birds which have greater mobility. Many wildlife mitigation properties have never been intensively surveyed for herpetofauna. We have designed this monitoring program to provide managers with information about the species that presently occur on individual projects (the inventory phase) and about the effectiveness of their habitat management practices (monitoring phase) in restoring or maintaining the species assemblages that occur there. Because of their vulnerable status and usefulness as indicators, we have made amphibian monitoring a priority in all permanent or seasonally wet habitat types (riparian forest, riparian shrub, emergent wetland, wetland meadow). We use standards in Heyer et al. (1994) for larval trapping, a method well suited for amphibians.",
