  "abstractText": "Waterfowl abundance data collected through camera trap monitoring has been conducted at the TD-1 project for five consecutive years to help demonstrate the response of migratory waterfowl to habitat manipulation and moist soil management. Water regime manipulation, soil disturbance, vegetation management, and supplemental planting play a key role in promoting early succesional wetlands. These practices encourage waterfowl use and provide beneficial habitat for other wetland obligate species. The number of waterfowl utilizing the TD-1 project has increased for the fourth year in a row and demonstrates the success of this project through intense management practices. 2022 marks the third year waterfowl abundance has been tracked at the TD-2 project. The primary goal of the TD-2 project was to create 71 acres of hemi marsh habitat within 19 isolated wetland basins to encourage waterfowl brood production. Tall emergent vegetation and sedimentation are heavily impacting these wetland basins and therefore making them less diesireable to waterfowl. Our goal is to continue monitoring these basins with cameras to witness a positive response to waterfowl abundance as management practices increase. In our study design, biologists place elevated camera traps across habitats in the project area. Photos are taken every hour from sunrise to sunset. Each camera trap has a measureable surface area (1 acre) to create sub-samples of waterfowl density estimates across the project area",
