  "abstract": " The text is about a method called \"cod traps\" used for catching burbot fish. This method is important because it provides an effective, non-lethal way to capture burbot for stock assessment. Cod traps are easy to deploy and retrieve, making them convenient for fishermen. They are also durable, meaning they can be used multiple times. Furthermore, cod traps have a low bycatch rate, which means that unwanted fish are minimally caught in the process. These features make cod traps a cost-effective solution compared to other fishing methods. The text also explains the process of deploying and retrieving cod traps, but the focus is on their advantages for burbot stock assessment."

  "description": " The text body discusses the utilization of cod traps for burbot capture, as described by Spence (2000). Cod traps function efficiently in burbot fisheries due to their inherent advantages. They are characterized as non-lethal, allowing for the safe capture and release of unwanted or undersized fish.\n\nThe deployment process of cod traps is relatively straightforward. These traps are typically baited with attractive lures, such as herring or other smelly baits, to attract burbot. Once set in the water, they remain stationary until a burbot takes the bait, at which point the trap door automatically opens, allowing the fish to enter. The trapped burbot can then be easily retrieved by fishermen using ropes attached to the traps.\n\nCod traps are renowned for their ease of use and convenience. They can be quickly deployed and retrieved, making them ideal for small-scale and seasonal fishing operations. Furthermore, they have a low environmental impact due to their selective nature; cod traps typically only capture burbot and allow other fish species to swim freely.\n\nCod traps are also incredibly durable and long-lasting. Their robust construction ensures they can withstand the harshest of marine conditions, making them an excellent investment for fishermen. Additionally, their relatively low cost makes cod traps a popular choice for those seeking an affordable yet effective fishing method.\n\nIn summary, the text body describes how cod traps are employed in burbot capture due to their non-lethal nature, ease of use, minimal bycatch, durability, and affordability. Cod traps function via a baited trap door system that automatically opens when a burbot takes the bait. Their deployment, retrieval, and environmental impact make them an essential tool for those involved in burbot stock assessment."

  "constraints": " Based on the given text, here are the constraints applicable to the use of cod traps for burbot:\n\n1. Non-lethal: Cod traps are described as non-lethal, which means they do not kill the targeted species immediately upon capture. This constraint is important for sustainable fishing practices and to ensure that only mature specimens are removed from the population. (Line 2)\n\n2. Easy to deploy and retrieve: Cod traps are convenient to use as they can be easily deployed and retrieved, making them a practical choice for fishermen. (Line 3)\n\n3. Easy to store: The text implies that cod traps can be easily stored when not in use, which is beneficial for fishermen who may have limited space on their boats or at their fishing sites. (Line 4)\n\n4. Low bycatch: Cod traps are known for having a low bycatch rate, meaning they capture mainly the targeted species with minimal unintended captures of other fish or marine organisms. This is an essential constraint for maintaining biodiversity and reducing waste in fishing activities. (Line 5)\n\n5. Durable: Cod traps are described as durable, which means they can withstand various conditions and last longer than less robust alternatives, ensuring a long lifespan and reducing the need for frequent replacements. (Line 6)\n\n6. Relatively inexpensive: The use of cod traps is mentioned to be relatively inexpensive compared to other fishing methods, which makes it an accessible choice for fishermen with limited resources. (Line 7)\n\nNo code provided as the question did not request it."
