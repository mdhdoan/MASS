2. Abstract: Moist soil management activities play a crucial role in improving habitats for waterfowl and other wetland species. To monitor the impact of these activities on waterfowl populations, remote camera surveys and waterfowl abundance counts are conducted. By placing elevated camera traps across different habitats, biologists can capture photos of waterfowl and estimate their density. This method provides a non-invasive way to study waterfowl behavior and habitat use, allowing for more effective management strategies.

3. Description: The text describes a research project focused on moist soil management activities and their impact on waterfowl populations. Two projects, TD-1 and TD-2, are mentioned, with the former conducting waterfowl abundance counts during spring migration for three consecutive years to monitor waterfowl response to increased habitat management. The latter project aimed to create 71 acres of hemi-marsh habitat to provide brood ponds for local waterfowl production. However, due to tall emergent vegetation and sedimentation, wetlands in TD-2 are seeing low amounts of waterfowl production. To address this issue, remote camera surveys were implemented in both project areas during the 2020 season, with two cameras added to TD-2. Biologists place elevated camera traps across habitats in a project area, taking photos every hour from sunrise to sunset. Each camera trap has a measurable surface area of one acre, allowing for sub-samples of density estimates across the project area.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to monitor and assess waterfowl populations in relation to moist soil management activities, with the goal of improving habitat management strategies.

5. Constraints: The constraints of this method include the need for adequate funding for camera traps and data analysis, as well as the availability of skilled biologists to place and monitor the cameras. Additionally, weather conditions and potential damage to camera traps by animals or human activity may also pose challenges.
