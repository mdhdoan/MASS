2. Abstract: Setlines are a passive fishing method that utilizes a main line with baited hooks placed at regular intervals. They are typically set on the bottom of bodies of water such as rivers, reservoirs, or lakes, and their configurations can be adjusted based on study objectives. This method increases efficiency in catching fish while minimizing human effort and interaction with the environment.
3. Description: Setlines consist of a main line with baited hooks placed along it at regular intervals. They are designed to be passive fishing gear, requiring minimal human intervention. Setlines are usually set on the river, reservoir, or lake bottom and weighted at each end with anchors to ensure stability. The configurations of setlines, including line length, line type, gangion leader length, hook size, hook type, gangion clip type and size, and bait, are dependent on study objectives. These variables can be adjusted to optimize the success of the fishing method for specific species or conditions.
4. Target: The primary focus of setlines is to efficiently catch fish with minimal human effort and interaction with the environment.
5. Constraints: Setlines require careful configuration based on study objectives, as well as monitoring to ensure compliance with regulations regarding their use and potential impact on non-target species. Additionally, environmental factors such as water currents and weather conditions may affect setline performance.
