2. Abstract: This text discusses the importance of standardized stock assessment for managing the Burbot population in Lake Roosevelt. A method called FWIN surveys is evaluated for its adequacy in Burbot stock assessment and found to be generally adequate. However, there is a need to evaluate the size selectivity of the gill net gear used in FWIN surveys. The primary goal is to achieve a stable Burbot population that allows for some harvest, by providing technical advice to the Lake Roosevelt Co-Managers regarding management alternatives.

3. Description: The text emphasizes the need for standardized stock assessment data to manage the Burbot population in Lake Roosevelt. Bonar et al. (1997; 2000a) highlighted the importance of such a program to monitor trends in abundance, growth, and condition of Burbot in Washington State. Long-term standardized fish sampling programs are commonly used for monitoring fish stocks, including Burbot. Without this data, management biologists cannot evaluate the effects of management strategies, exploitation, or biotic and abiotic factors on Burbot populations.

The Lake Roosevelt Data Collection Project, FWIN surveys, are found to be a common source of bycatch for Burbot. An analysis of ten years of FWIN data (2003-2012) concluded that the program is adequate for monitoring year-to-year differences in Lake Roosevelt Burbot population indices. However, there is a need to evaluate the size selectivity of the gill net gear used in FWIN surveys. This can be estimated indirectly by fishing multiple mesh gill nets with equal effort and comparing catch frequencies within each of the mesh sizes. Length data can be corrected prior to the calculation of length-based stock assessment indices, and age bias resulting from gill net selectivity can be corrected by applying the proportion of fish of each age within each length bin to the bias-corrected length data.

The primary objective of the project is to provide technical advice to the Lake Roosevelt Co-Managers regarding management alternatives so that they can develop realistic fishery targets and appropriate implementation strategies. The approach will be to estimate the harvest potential of Lake Roosevelt Burbot under current management and population characteristics, as well as evaluate a series of management alternatives using simulations.

4. Target: The primary focus is to achieve a Burbot population in Lake Roosevelt that has stable abundance and is managed to provide some harvest.
5. Constraints: The main constraint is the need to evaluate the size selectivity of the gill net gear used in FWIN surveys, which requires further study and analysis.
