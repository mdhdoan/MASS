2. Abstract: This method is based on an EMAP protocol for monitoring western wadable streams and details the steps required to collect important data about stream bank characteristics. The information gathered using this method aids in estimating bankful dimensions of stream channels, which are crucial for calculating shear stress and bed stability. By measuring bank angle, undercut distance, wetted channel width, and mid-channel bars, researchers can better understand the dynamics of these water bodies and assess their health and ecological status.

3. Description: The method described is derived from an EMAP protocol developed for monitoring western wadable streams. It focuses on collecting essential stream bank characteristics using cross-sectional transects to determine bank angle, undercut distance, wetted channel width, and mid-channel bars' width. These measurements help estimate bankful stage dimensions, which are vital in EMAP surveys to calculate shear stress and bed stability. The method involves measuring the bank angle on both banks using a meter stick and a clinometer, checking for undercuts and measuring their horizontal distance to the nearest 0.01 m, examining both banks to determine channel incision or the height up from the water surface to the elevation of the first terrace of the valley floodplain, and recording it as the incised height. Additionally, wetted width, bankfull channel width, and mid-channel bars' width must be measured for a comprehensive analysis.

4. Target: The primary focus or goal of this method is to provide standardized guidelines for collecting essential stream bank characteristics data in EMAP surveys to estimate bankful stage dimensions, shear stress, and bed stability in western wadable streams.

5. Constraints: This method requires specific tools such as a meter stick, clinometer, and possibly other equipment depending on the terrain and conditions of the water body. Additionally, precise measurements are necessary for accurate data collection, making it essential to have skilled personnel operating under appropriate weather and environmental conditions.
