  "abstractText": "Artificial salmonid redds have been used to establish or re-establish runs of fish following restoration projects or when habitat is being underutilized (Harshbarger and Porter 1982; Gustafson-Marjanen and Moring 1994). Numerous devices for planting salmonid eggs have been described in the literature (Donaghy and Verspoor 2000). In sediment heavy systems, egg incubation boxes tend to fill with sediment suffocating the eggs, which leads to fungus from dead eggs spreading within the boxes. In addition, systems with high flows and high bed movement can cause the boxes to become removed from their anchoring system, and lost in the river. Therefore, direct egg planting is some systems is the logical method to reduce loss from sediment, equipment loss, and the accumulation of plastic egg boxes in the river.",
