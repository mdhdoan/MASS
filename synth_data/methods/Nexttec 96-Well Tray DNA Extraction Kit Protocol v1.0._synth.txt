 1. Keywords: nexttecTM Clean Plates 96 fish protocol, DNA extraction kit, high quality/quantity DNA extract, SNP genotyping, one-step purification.
2. Abstract: The nexttecTM Clean Plates 96 fish protocol is a DNA extraction method that provides high-quality and high-yield DNA extract suitable for various enzymatic reactions, such as restriction digests, real-time PCR, PCR, and SNP genotyping. Unlike most other kits/protocols, this method retains proteins, detergents, and low molecular weight compounds on the column resin, allowing DNA to pass through during a short, one-step purification procedure. This technique ensures the extracted DNA is free from impurities, making it ideal for SNP genotyping.
3. Description: The nexttecTM Clean Plates 96 fish protocol is a DNA extraction kit that yields high-quality and high-quantity DNA extract specifically designed for SNP genotyping. This method differs from others as it does not retain any DNA on the column resin, instead retaining proteins, detergents, and low molecular weight compounds. The short, one-step purification procedure allows DNA to pass through the column, resulting in a pure DNA extract suitable for common enzymatic reactions such as restriction digests, real-time PCR, PCR, and SNP genotyping.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide high-quality and high-quantity DNA extract specifically for SNP genotyping.
5. Constraints: This method is designed for use with fish samples, so its effectiveness may vary when used with other types of organisms. Additionally, the use of this kit requires access to laboratory equipment and materials for DNA extraction and purification.
