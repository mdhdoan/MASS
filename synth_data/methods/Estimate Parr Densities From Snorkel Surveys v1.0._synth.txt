 1. Keywords: Monitoring, Salmonids, Juvenile and Adult, Occurrence and Density, Spatial Structure, Productivity.

2. Abstract: This method focuses on monitoring the occurrence and density of both juvenile and adult salmonids. The importance of this process is to assess the spatial structure and productivity of these fish populations. Understanding their distribution and abundance can provide valuable insights into the health and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems, aiding in informed decision-making for conservation efforts.

3. Description: This method involves tracking two life stages of salmonids (juvenile and adult) to evaluate their spatial structure and productivity. The data collected from monitoring allows researchers to analyze patterns in the distribution and density of these fish populations. By comparing juvenile and adult densities, researchers can identify potential productivity issues, such as declining populations or poor reproduction rates. This information is crucial for understanding the overall health and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems, allowing managers to implement targeted conservation strategies.

4. Target: The primary focus of this method is assessing the spatial structure and productivity of salmonid populations through monitoring their occurrence and density.

5. Constraints: Constraints for this method include adequate funding and resources for continuous monitoring, accurate data collection, reliable identification of juvenile and adult salmonids, and potential limitations in accessing suitable monitoring locations within aquatic ecosystems.
