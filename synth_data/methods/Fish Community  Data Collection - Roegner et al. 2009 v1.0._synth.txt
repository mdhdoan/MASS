2. Abstract: The necessity for restoration efforts in the Columbia River Estuary is driven by the need to increase available habitat for endangered and threatened juvenile salmonid populations. A key aspect of evaluating the success of these restoration projects is demonstrating increased use of restored habitats by salmonids compared to reference areas. Basic monitoring protocols include counting and measuring fish species, which can be used to generate species composition and size-frequency histograms. However, more advanced measurements such as genetics, marks and tags, and prey availability and consumption are recommended for a comprehensive assessment of habitat utilization by different salmon stocks and life history types. The relationship between fish habitat use and physical conditions, such as water quality and hydrology, is crucial for evaluating and predicting restoration success in the estuary.
3. Description: The text describes the importance of restoring habitats in the Columbia River Estuary (CRE) to increase available space for rearing and migrating juvenile salmonid populations listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Successful restoration is measured by demonstrating increased use of restored locations by salmonids compared to reference habitats. The minimum protocols for fish monitoring include abundance and size measurements of species at each site, from which species composition and size-frequency histograms can be generated. However, the text recommends higher order measurements for a more accurate assessment of habitat utilization by different salmon stocks and life history types. These advanced measurements include genetics, marks and tags, and prey availability and consumption. The relationship between fish habitat use and physical conditions such as water quality, hydrology, and water quality will be important for evaluating and predicting restoration success in the CRE.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to evaluate the success of restoration efforts in the Columbia River Estuary by measuring increased use of restored habitats by juvenile salmonids compared to reference areas.
5. Constraints: The main constraints for this method include the need for advanced measurements such as genetics, marks and tags, and prey availability and consumption, which may require specialized knowledge and equipment. Additionally, evaluating the relationship between fish habitat use and physical conditions such as water quality and hydrology requires accurate data on these factors.
