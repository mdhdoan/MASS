2. Abstract: High-density genome-wide DNA sequencing is a powerful tool for identifying genetic markers useful in Parentage Based Tagging and Genetic Stock Identification projects. It also allows for the detection of genes under selection, which can be crucial in predicting adaptations to climate change. While whole-genome sequencing of multiple individuals remains costly, recent methods such as Pool-Seq offer a more affordable alternative by pooling and homogenizing DNA from multiple individuals, providing a representation of allele frequencies at a fraction of the cost.
3. Description: The text discusses the benefits of high-density genome-wide DNA sequencing in increasing the likelihood of discovering genetic markers for Parentage Based Tagging and Genetic Stock Identification projects. It also highlights its use in identifying genes under selection, using the example of Narum et al (2013) who identified genes in Oncorhynchus mykiss under selection for thermal stress. The text notes that while reference genomes are increasingly available across broad taxa, the costs associated with whole-genome sequencing of multiple individuals remain a limitation. To address this, methods such as Pool-Seq have been developed, which involve pooling and homogenizing DNA from multiple individuals and sequencing the mixture. This provides a representation of allele frequencies for populations at a fraction of the cost of sequencing individuals. The text also references Method 6754 for whole genome resequencing using an individual barcoding method.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to provide a more affordable alternative to whole-genome sequencing of multiple individuals by pooling and homogenizing DNA from multiple individuals, providing a representation of allele frequencies at a fraction of the cost.
5. Constraints: The main constraint for this method is the costs associated with whole-genome sequencing of multiple individuals.
