  "abstractText": "Tributary overshoot occurs when adult salmon and steelhead returning to their stream of origin continue upstream past the mouth of that stream. Tributary overshoot appears to be a common behavior by many Columbia River populations and the proportion of overshoots that do not return downstream to their natal sites can be high. If overshoots do not return to their tributary of origin this will reduce the number of spawning adults for that population. And if overshoots spawn in a non-natal tributary that could negatively impact the receiving populations fitness. Therefore, reliable estimates of overshoot rate and monitoring of adult migration patterns is important for the management and recovery of Columbia River salmon and steelhead populations.",
