  "background": "The PACFISH/INFISH (PIBO) Effectiveness Monitoring Program for aquatic and riparian resources was developed in 1998 in response to monitoring needs addressed in the Biological Opinions for bull trout (USFWS 1998) and steelhead (NMFS 1995). The primary objective is to determine whether priority biological and physical attributes, processes, and functions of riparian and aquatic systems are being degraded, maintained, or restored in the PIBO area. The program samples within the interior Columbia River basin on lands managed by U.S. Forest Service (FS) Regions 1, 4, and 6 and the Idaho and Oregon/Washington State Offices of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).This document (hereafter the PIBO Monitoring Protocol) describes the sampling methods used by the PIBO Monitoring Program to quantify stream and riparian attributes. The methods are a result of over two decades of use, evaluation, and peer review. We worked with the Aquatic and Riparian Effectiveness Monitoring Program to standardize methods, which resulted in a document titled Effectiveness Monitoring for Streams and Riparian Areas within the Pacific Northwest: Stream Channel Methods for Core Attributes (USDA 2006).",
