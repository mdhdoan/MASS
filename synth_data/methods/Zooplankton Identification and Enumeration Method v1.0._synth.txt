2. Abstract:
Zooplankton are crucial indicators of aquatic ecosystem health, and accurately measuring their densities, body lengths, and biomass is essential for understanding the dynamics of these systems. This method involves sorting, counting, and identifying zooplankton to species or lowest practical taxa using established keys. When organism densities are too high to count directly, sub-sampling is employed using a Motodo 1.5 L plankton splitter. Body lengths are measured for the first 30 individuals of each species using a Leica MZ-8 dissecting microscope fitted with an optical micrometer. Biomass is determined for each species using length to dry weight regressions from Dumont et al., Bottrell et al., and Downing and Rigler.
3. Description:
The methodology begins by sorting, counting, and identifying zooplankton samples using keys by Brooks (1957), Edmondson (1963), Pennak (1989), and Thorp and Covich (1991). When organism densities are too high to count directly, sub-sampling is performed using a Motodo 1.5 L plankton splitter until approximately 300 organisms of the most prevalent species remain in the sub-sample. Body lengths are measured for the first 30 individuals of each species using a Leica MZ-8 dissecting microscope fitted with an optical micrometer. The remaining individuals are enumerated by species, and body length measurements are taken from the anterior-most region of the head to the posterior base of the carapace for branchiopods and from the anterior-most region of the head to the base of the caudal ramus for copepods. Zooplankton biomass is determined using length to dry weight regressions from Dumont et al., Bottrell et al., and Downing and Rigler.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to accurately measure zooplankton densities, body lengths, and biomass in aquatic ecosystems.
5. Constraints:
The constraints for this method include the need for specialized equipment such as a Motodo 1.5 L plankton splitter, Leica MZ-8 dissecting microscope fitted with an optical micrometer, and length to dry weight regressions from Dumont et al., Bottrell et al., and Downing and Rigler. Additionally, the method requires a trained observer to accurately identify zooplankton species and measure body lengths.
