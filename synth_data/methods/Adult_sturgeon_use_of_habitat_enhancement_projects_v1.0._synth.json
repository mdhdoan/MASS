  "abstract": " The text describes a monitoring plan using Vemco's VPS (Vessel Mounted Positioning System) to study the movements and habits of adult sturgeon in the Kootenai River/Kootenay Lake system. This is crucial as dam operations directly influence temperature, flow, and river stage which impacts sturgeon habitat and spawning. The goal is to enhance existing spawning substrates through two upcoming projects.\n\nThe VPS system consists of underwater acoustic transmitters attached to the sturgeons and receivers placed in specific locations throughout the water body. Data collected from these receivers is sent to Vemco for processing, providing interim positions and recommendations for improvements if needed. The final report with accurate sturgeon positions will be available once all data has been collected.\n\nThe importance of this method lies in its ability to determine sturgeon habitat usage during their spawning season, improving current spawning substrates and contributing to the overall recovery goal of the species. Previous data collected in 2014 serves as a baseline for comparison. The VPS system's position accuracy is expected to be similar to that of GPS, ensuring reliable results.\n\nThere seems to be no code involved in this text."

  "description": " This text discusses a monitoring plan for evaluating sturgeon movements and habitat usage in the Kootenai River/Kootenay Lake system using passive telemetry techniques with Vemco VR2W equipment. The primary objective is to assess the impact of Libby dam operations on large-scale movements and fish responses, specifically adult spawning sturgeons, focusing on substrate habitat enhancement projects.\n\nThe monitoring plan involves employing a VPS (Vemco Positioning System) consisting of underwater acoustic transmitters and receivers as well as a receiver data processing service provided by VEMCO. Periodic collection of receiver data is essential to ensure proper system functionality. VEMCO provides interim calculated positions, which may necessitate design changes to address performance issues. Upon completion of the study, VEMCO will deliver a final report with calculated positions for habitat usage analysis.\n\nThe VPS system functions based on position resolution from collected receiver data. The expected position accuracy is similar to that provided by the GPS standard positioning service, which is 95% within a 15-meter error circle. In 2014, data was collected and analyzed prior to two scheduled habitat enhancement projects due in spring 2015. This data serves as pre-treatment information for comparison post-project implementation."

  "constraints": " The text describes a monitoring plan using passive telemetry techniques with Vemco VR2W systems to study sturgeon movements and habitat usage in the Kootenai River/Kootenay Lake system. The method is constrained by several factors:\n\n1. **Temperature, flow, and river stage:** These environmental factors are directly impacted by Libby dam operations, making it essential to monitor sturgeon movements to evaluate their responses (line 2-4).\n\n2. **Habitat usage by adult spawning sturgeon:** Determining habitat usage is a significant aspect of the monitoring plan and recovery goal for sturgeon (lines 6-8).\n\n3. **Position accuracy:** The text mentions that position accuracy from VEMCO's VPS system is expected to be similar to GPS standard positioning service, which is around 95% of positions within a 15-meter error circle (lines 19-20). This could limit the precision of determining habitat usage and sturgeon movements.\n\n4. **Design changes:** VEMCO may recommend changes to the design of the system based on interim data analysis and performance issues (line 13).\n\n5. **Study duration:** The study is scheduled to be completed by the spring 2015 sturgeon spawning season, with data collected in 2014 serving as pre-treatment data (lines 22-23).\n\nThere's no need for code generation since there isn't any specific code mentioned within the text."
