  "background": "Shoreline spawning habitat is monitored to assess the influence of winter lake elevation on quality of spawning habitat. Additionally, new operations at Albeni Falls Dam (e.g., winter lake level fluctuations) have been proposed and have potential to impact spawning habitat. Therefore, we monitor habitat conditions at standardized shoreline sites to better understand the effects of winter dam operations on shoreline spawning habitat.",
