2. Abstract:
The Columbia River Basin is facing a significant decline in anadromous salmonid populations, with several of them now protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). A comprehensive monitoring strategy is necessary to address the uncertainties surrounding these declines and develop effective recovery plans. This method involves implementing a monitoring program that continuously monitors seven water quality attributes at integrator sites located at the downstream end of each population or subpopulation's distribution. The data collected will be used for ESA assessments and recovery planning, as well as to assess the impact of stream flow on water quality attributes. This method aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of the monitoring programs for anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin.
3. Description:
The text body describes a method for implementing a comprehensive monitoring strategy for anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin, which have experienced significant declines over the past 30 years, with several populations now protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The method involves continuous monitoring of seven water quality attributes, including temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorous. These attributes will be monitored at integrator sites located at the downstream end of each population or subpopulation's distribution, where data is most appropriately viewed. The monitoring programs will follow manufacturers' guidelines for deployment and calibration, and co-locate water quality monitoring stations with associated flow gauges operated by the USGS or WDOE. This allows investigators to assess the impact of stream flow on water quality attributes. The accuracy of the water quality instruments meets the Data Quality Level A as defined by the Oregon Watershed Plan Water Quality Monitoring Technical Guidebook (2001).
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to develop a comprehensive monitoring strategy for anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin that will improve the accuracy and reliability of the monitoring programs, reduce uncertainties surrounding declines, and inform ESA assessments and recovery planning.
5. Constraints:
The constraints for this method include the need for adequate funding to implement and maintain a comprehensive monitoring program, the availability and accessibility of monitoring sites located at the downstream end of each population or subpopulation's distribution, the accuracy and reliability of water quality instruments and flow gauges, and the need for data collection and analysis that meets ESA requirements for species and habitat assessments at multiple spatial scales.
