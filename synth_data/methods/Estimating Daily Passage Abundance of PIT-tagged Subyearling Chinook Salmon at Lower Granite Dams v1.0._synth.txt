2. Abstract:
This method describes a way to estimate the daily passage abundance of downstream-migrating juvenile anadromous salmonid smolts (Oncorhynchus sp.) using fish passage bypasses equipped with screens that divert the fish into flumes for data collection. This approach is necessary because nearly all large rivers in North America have been impounded, and the turbine intakes and spillways are the primary routes of passage used by downstream migrating juvenile fish. The method involves calculating the collection probability, which is the proportion of the total number of PIT-tagged fish that pass a dam by all passage routes combined on a given day that is diverted into the bypass. This method was developed for subyearling Chinook salmon at Lower Granite Dam but can be adapted to other age classes, species, and dams.
3. Description:
The text describes a method used to estimate daily passage abundance of downstream-migrating juvenile anadromous salmonid smolts (Oncorhynchus sp.) using fish passage bypasses equipped with screens that divert the fish into flumes for data collection. The primary routes of passage used by downstream migrating juvenile fish are turbine intakes and spillways. Many dams, including Lower Granite Dam along the lower Snake River, have bypasses composed of screens in the turbine intakes that divert smolts away from the powerhouse into flumes that empty into holding raceways or the dam tailrace. These bypasses function as fish traps and can be used to collect data needed to estimate daily passage abundance of smolts using an equation (N^i= ni/C^i), where ni is the number of PIT-tagged smolts detected in the bypass and Ci is the collection probability estimated for that time period. Collection probability is the proportion of the total number of PIT-tagged fish that pass a dam by all passage routes combined on a given day that is diverted into the bypass. Outflow, which is the total volume of water that passed the dam, and turbine allocation, which is the proportion of outflow passed through the turbines intakes, can affect collection probability. Decreases in turbine allocation caused by passing water over the spillways decreases collection probability. The actual relationship between collection probability and outflow and turbine allocation varies by age class, species, and age class. Thus, that relationship must be established specifically for a given age class, species, and dam. This method was developed for subyearling Chinook salmon at Lower Granite Dam.
4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of the method is to estimate daily passage abundance of downstream-migrating juvenile anadromous salmonid smolts (Oncorhynchus sp.) using fish passage bypasses equipped with screens that divert the fish into flumes for data collection.
5. Constraints:
The constraints for this method include the need to establish the actual relationship between collection probability and outflow and turbine allocation specifically for a given age class, species, and dam. Additionally, decreases in turbine allocation caused by passing water over the spillways can decrease collection probability, making it more difficult to accurately estimate daily passage abundance.
