  "background": "The ability to estimate both out-migrant abundance and adult returns allows for the calculation of key performance metrics such as smolt-to-adult return rate and recruits-per-spawner. These metrics and indicators can be used to determine population status, evaluate the effectiveness of management actions, and assess recovery of a population.",
