  "abstractText": "During the predator removal efforts, bull trout are incidentally captured as a bycatch species. Despite efforts to reduce bull trout catch and mortality rates, some of the bull trout do not survive. We use a genetic analysis to assess what effects netting bycatch may be having on local and regional bull trout runs. This method describes how we use genetics to assign bull trout mortalities back to a region and tributary of origin.",
