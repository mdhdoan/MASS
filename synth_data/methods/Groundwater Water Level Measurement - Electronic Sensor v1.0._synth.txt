2. Abstract: This method describes the process of collecting groundwater samples to characterize and identify contaminants. It is crucial to obtain representative samples from wells or other sources like seeps and springs. The text also discusses the importance of regular water level measurements for monitoring and understanding groundwater flow. Two types of wells are commonly sampled: production wells, which are used for regular water supply, and monitoring wells, specifically installed to monitor groundwater. Various measuring devices and methods are used to collect water level measurements, with the electronic sensor being the preferred option due to its accuracy and precision.

3. Description: The primary objective of this method is the collection of representative samples from two types of wells â€“ production wells (which include domestic, industrial, municipal, and irrigation wells) and monitoring wells. Production wells have pumps installed for regular water supply, while monitoring wells are specifically constructed to monitor groundwater quality and levels. The text highlights the importance of ensuring that collected samples accurately represent the groundwater being sampled.

Water level measurements are essential for understanding groundwater recharge, constructing potentiometric surface maps, calculating hydraulic gradient between wells, identifying drawdown influences from surrounding wells, and calculating purge volumes. Various measuring devices and techniques are discussed in the text, with the electronic sensor being the preferred method due to its accuracy and precision.

4. Target: To establish a standardized groundwater sampling method for collecting representative samples from wells while ensuring minimal operator error and maintaining accuracy.
5. Constraints: The main constraints of this method include the requirement for specialized equipment, potential errors caused by inexperienced operators, and the necessity for regular calibration to ensure accurate water level measurements.
