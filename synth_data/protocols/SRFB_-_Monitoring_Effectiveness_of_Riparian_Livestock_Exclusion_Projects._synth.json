  "abstract": " The text outlines a monitoring plan for evaluating the effectiveness of livestock exclusion fencing projects in improving riparian areas and stream bank stability. This is important because cattle can cause significant damage to streams by breaking down banks, destroying vegetation, increasing erosion, and sedimentation. By excluding cattle with fencing, these negative impacts can be avoided, allowing the riparian area to recover and restore.\n\nThe monitoring plan aims to answer three main questions: (1) whether livestock are excluded from the riparian area, (2) if riparian vegetation has been restored, and (3) if bank erosion has been reduced. To do this, access to impact and control reaches will be provided. The plan includes determining the proportion of actively eroding stream banks, riparian vegetation cover layers and percent shading within the project area, livestock use of the excluded riparian area, total kilometers of stream protected, and total acreage to be fenced at specific time points (Year 0, 1, 3, 5, and 10). Additionally, the percentage of pool tail fines will be determined for both Year 0 and Years 1, 3, 5, and 10.\n\nThis method is necessary to assess the success of livestock exclusion projects in achieving their goals and to identify any potential issues that may need attention. By collecting and analyzing data on these specific factors at multiple time points, stakeholders can make informed decisions about the effectiveness of their projects and take corrective actions when necessary."

  "description": " This document outlines the procedures and techniques used for evaluating the performance of livestock exclusion projects, with a particular focus on the exclusion of livestock from riparian zones, the restoration of riparian vegetation, and the improvement of stream bank stability. The objectives of livestock exclusion fencing include preventing cattle from damaging the riparian area, promoting bank stabilization, shading, and erosion control, and enabling the recovery of shoreline ecosystems.\n\nThe monitoring plan aims to address the following questions: 1) Is livestock successfully excluded from the riparian area? 2) Has riparian vegetation been effectively restored in the affected reach? and 3) Has bank erosion decreased in the impacted reach? To answer these queries, access to both impact and control reaches will be granted.\n\nThe following parameters are scheduled for assessment at Years 1, 3, 5, and 10:\n\n1. The proportion of actively eroding stream banks: This metric involves assessing the percentage of stream bank that is currently experiencing erosion.\n2. Riparian vegetation cover layers and percent shading within the project area: This assessment evaluates the density and diversity of vegetation in riparian zones, as well as the level of shade produced by vegetation.\n3. Livestock usage of the excluded riparian area: This analysis measures the frequency and extent to which livestock utilize the fenced-off riparian area.\n\nAdditional measurements will be taken at Year 0 for the following parameters:\n\n1. The proportion of actively eroding stream banks: This baseline measurement provides a comparison point for subsequent assessments.\n2. Riparian vegetation cover layers and percent shading within the project area: This data is collected to determine the extent of any pre-existing vegetation in the riparian zone before fencing installation.\n3. Total kilometers of stream protected: This measurement establishes the total length of the waterbody under protection by the livestock exclusion project.\n4. Total acreage to be fenced: This assessment records the extent of the land area to be enclosed by the fencing.\n5. Overall usage by livestock of the riparian area to be excluded: This analysis provides an understanding of livestock behavior prior to the installation of the exclusion fencing.\n6. Percentage of pool tail fines: This measurement quantifies the volume of sediment accumulated in pool tail areas (the deepening sections of a stream where water collects).\n\nThese assessments will be conducted using appropriate monitoring tools and techniques, ensuring that data is collected systematically, accurately, and consistently over time."
