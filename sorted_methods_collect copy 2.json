  "Beach Seine - Cable-L Trap Set v1.0": " Data Collection\nSampling Design\nSeine fishing method is often used in the context of fisheries management and ecological studies. It is a sampling technique that involves encircling a school or shoal of fish with a net called a seine, which is drawn ashore or into a boat to capture the fish. Seining can be carried out in various habitats, such as rivers, estuaries, lakes, reservoirs, and marine environments. The effectiveness of seining depends on several factors, including habitat characteristics (e.g., water flow, temperature, structure), fish behavior, time of day and year, net design, and method. Seining can be used for various purposes, such as capture of fish for marking or biological sampling, and inspection for marks.\n\nSeine fishing method falls under the category of \"Sampling Design\" within the broader field of \"Data Collection\" in fisheries management and ecological studies. This is because seine fishing is a specific technique used to collect data on fish populations and their habitats. The choice of sampling design, including the type of seine net and the timing and location of sampling, can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of the data collected. Therefore, it is essential to consider various factors that may affect selectivity and capture efficiency when designing a sampling program for seine fishing.\n\nHere are some potential subcategories within \"Sampling Design\" for Seine fishing method:\n\n* Net size and design: This includes information on the dimensions, mesh size, and material of the seine net used for fishing.\n* Deployment method: This refers to how the seine net is deployed and retrieved from the water, including the use of boats or beaches, and the presence of assistance from personnel or machinery.\n* Frequency and duration of sampling: This includes information on how often and for how long the seine net is used for fishing, which may impact the sample size and representativeness of the data collected.\n* Spatial coverage: This refers to the extent and location of the areas surveyed using seine fishing, including the use of multiple sites or transects.\n* Seasonality and temporal considerations: This includes information on the time of day, month, and year when sampling is conducted, which may impact fish behavior and population dynamics.\n\nOverall, the Seine fishing method plays a crucial role in fisheries management and ecological studies, and understanding its design and implementation can help researchers collect accurate and reliable data on fish populations and their habitats.",
