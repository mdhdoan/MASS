2. Abstract: This method is crucial for estimating the effective population size (Ne) of salmon and steelhead populations, which directly impacts genetic diversity loss and inbreeding rates. The Colony software, a maximum likelihood method, is used to assign/infer parentage and sibship among individuals through multi-locus genotypes. By estimating full- and half-sib relationships and mating systems, the inbreeding Ne can be calculated from sibship assignments. This approach helps conserve populations by understanding their genetic structure and reproduction dynamics.
3. Description: The necessity of determining effective population size (Ne) for salmon and steelhead populations is emphasized due to its direct relation with genetic diversity loss and inbreeding rates, which impact overall population viability. The Colony software, a maximum likelihood method, plays a central role in this process by implementing methods for assigning/inferring parentage, sibship, mating systems (polygamous/monogamous), and reproductive skew in both diploid and haplo-diploid species.

The key feature of Colony is its ability to estimate the inbreeding Ne from sibship assignments. Within a sample taken at random from a population, full and half-sib dyad frequencies can be used to determine the current effective size of the population. This method relies on the fact that smaller populations result in higher sibling proportions. Consequently, lower Ne values indicate increased probabilities of siblings sharing the same father, mother, or both when randomly selecting two individuals from the same cohort within a population.

To summarize, this method focuses on estimating the effective population size by analyzing genetic data with software like Colony. By inferring sibship relationships and mating systems, conservationists can better understand genetic structures and breeding dynamics in salmon and steelhead populations, ultimately contributing to their long-term viability.

4. Target: Estimating effective population size for salmon and steelhead populations using genetic data analysis through software like Colony.
5. Constraints: The success of this method heavily relies on the quality and comprehensiveness of the collected genetic data. Additionally, computational resources required for processing large datasets may pose limitations in some cases.
