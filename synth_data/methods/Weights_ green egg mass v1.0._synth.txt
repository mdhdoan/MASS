4. Calculation
5. Values

Now, let's fill out the rest of the sections based on the given information:

2. Abstract:
The method described in the text involves calculating reproductive effort values for green egg masses. This calculation requires knowing the weight of the green egg mass and the whole body weight of the organism. Reproductive effort is an important metric in ecology and evolution, as it provides insight into the amount of resources that an organism invests in reproduction. By calculating reproductive effort values for green egg masses, researchers can better understand the reproductive strategies of the species in question.

3. Description:
The text states that green egg mass weight values are needed to calculate reproductive effort. Reproductive effort is calculated as the ratio of green egg mass weight to whole body weight. The purpose of this calculation is to determine the proportion of an organism's resources that are being allocated towards reproduction. This method assumes that the green egg mass weight and whole body weight values have been accurately measured. It also assumes that the green egg masses in question are representative of the species' typical reproductive output.

4. Target:
The primary focus or goal of this method is to calculate reproductive effort values for green egg masses.

5. Constraints:
The constraints of this method include the need for accurate measurements of green egg mass weight and whole body weight. Additionally, the green egg masses used in the calculation must be representative of the species' typical reproductive output.
