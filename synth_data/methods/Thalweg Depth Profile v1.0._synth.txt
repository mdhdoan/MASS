2. Abstract: This method describes how to measure water depth along the deepest part of a river or stream (thalweg) for an entire sample reach. The spacing between thalweg depth measurements is determined based on the width of the stream. This information is crucial in understanding the flow dynamics and morphology of water bodies, providing insights for various applications such as flood prediction, irrigation planning, and ecosystem management.
3. Description: To measure water depth along the thalweg for the entire sample reach, identify the thalweg first. The distance between thalweg measurements is determined by the width of the stream. For bankfull widths up to 2 m, measure thalweg depth every 0.5 m (30 measurements between main transects). For wider streams with bankfull widths greater than 2 m and up to 5 m, measure thalweg depth every 1 m (15 measurements between main transects). For even wider streams with bankfull widths greater than 5 m, measure thalweg depth at increments equal to 1/10 of the distance between transects (10 measurements between main transects). When measuring thalweg depths, ensure that they are only taken along the main channel and not on side channels or pools.
4. Target: The primary focus is to establish a method for accurately measuring water depth along the deepest part of a stream or river (thalweg) for an entire sample reach.
5. Constraints: Users must correctly identify the thalweg, determine bankfull width accurately, and follow the appropriate measurement spacing based on the bankfull width. Additionally, users should avoid measuring thalweg depths in side channels or pools not part of the main channel's thalweg.
