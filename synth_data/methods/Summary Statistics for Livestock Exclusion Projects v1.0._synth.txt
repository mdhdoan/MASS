2. Abstract: This method describes the use of an MS Access database to store and analyze data collected from livestock exclusion projects. Summary statistics are computed to reflect habitat conditions at the reach scale, with a focus on canopy density and riparian vegetation structure. These variables were selected due to their high signal-to-noise ratios, and significance testing is performed to assess their relationship with the projects. This approach allows for a standardized and rigorous evaluation of the impact of livestock exclusion on habitat conditions.
3. Description: The method begins with field data collection for livestock exclusion projects, which are then uploaded into an MS Access database. The database computes summary statistics, such as reach length, reach width, canopy cover, riparian vegetation structure, and bank erosion, to reflect habitat conditions at the reach scale. These summary statistics were developed as part of the EPA EMAP and selected based on their high signal-to-noise ratios. The method then focuses on two specific variables, canopy density and riparian vegetation structure, and performs significance testing to assess their relationship with the projects. The use of an MS Access database allows for efficient data management and analysis, while the focus on summary statistics and significance testing ensures a rigorous evaluation of the impact of livestock exclusion on habitat conditions.
4. Target: The primary goal of this method is to evaluate the impact of livestock exclusion projects on habitat conditions using an MS Access database and summary statistics.
5. Constraints: This method requires access to an MS Access database and the ability to perform significance testing. Additionally, the success of this method depends on the quality of the field data collection and the selection of appropriate summary statistics.
