2. Abstract: This text describes a method for obtaining and recording detailed locational information for projects, sites, and features, using latitude and longitude coordinates. The necessity for this method arises from the importance of accurately identifying and documenting the locations associated with various aspects of a project. The text provides guidance on how to use hardcopy maps, digital map data, and online resources to acquire and record this information, as well as introducing web mapping services for organizations requiring frequent and accurate geocoding information.
3. Description: The method described in the text focuses on the importance of accurately identifying and documenting locations related to projects, sites, and features. It begins by explaining that various sources of coordinate information can be used to simplify the process of reporting project area details. Hardcopy maps, such as USGS quad sheets, provide latitude-longitude coordinate grids along the edges, enabling users to determine the coordinates for specific locations. Digital map data, available from sources like National Geographic, can be loaded onto a PC for easy access and use. Free online resources, such as TopoZone, MapTechs, and Microsoft's TerraServer, allow users to search for areas of interest and display maps with lat-long coordinates. By holding the mouse over a point on these online maps, users can obtain the coordinates for that specific location. For organizations requiring regular access to geocoding data, web mapping services like ArcWeb Services for Geocoding are available. The text also provides a link to a glossary of terms related to spatial information.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to guide users in acquiring and recording accurate latitude-longitude coordinates for projects, sites, and features, using various sources and tools.
5. Constraints: This method assumes that users have access to the necessary resources, such as hardcopy maps, digital map data, or online mapping services. For organizations requiring frequent geocoding information, there may be associated costs with web mapping services. Additionally, this method is not intended to be a comprehensive guide for working with GIS or GPS but rather an introduction to building the required attributes in a database for tracking project information at a basic level.
