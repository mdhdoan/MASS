2. Abstract: This method involves evaluating substrate size and embeddedness at specific points along eleven predetermined transects, with additional substrate size measurements taken at ten evenly spaced cross-sections. Water depth is measured at each substrate sample point along the transects, but not at the midway cross-sections. The purpose of this method is to provide a detailed analysis of the substrate composition and water depth in the study area.
3. Description: At each of the eleven transects (A-K), five substrate size and embeddedness sample points are identified, with an additional five points at ten evenly spaced cross-sections between the transects. The substrate sampling points along the cross-section are located at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of the measured wetted width, specifically at the water's edge just within the left and right banks. Water depth is recorded at each substrate sample point along the transects, but not at the midway cross-sections. The additional cross-section measurements provide a more comprehensive understanding of the substrate characteristics in the study area.
4. Target: The primary focus of this method is to evaluate and measure substrate size, embeddedness, and water depth along predetermined transects and cross-sections.
5. Constraints: This method requires precise measurement of the transects, cross-sections, and sampling points, as well as accurate recording of the substrate size, embeddedness, and water depth at each point. Additionally, the method is limited to evaluating water depth at the transect sample points and not at the midway cross-sections.
