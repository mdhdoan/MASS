2. Abstract: This text describes a stream habitat evaluation method called the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI), developed by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. The QHEI provides a measure of macro-habitat quality that corresponds to physical factors affecting fish communities and other aquatic life such as invertebrates. A comparison is made between QHEI and the Minnesota Stream Habitat Assessment (MSHA) methodology, with the MSHA being considered a better reflection of important factors influencing Minnesota streams. The text highlights the necessity of adopting standardized definitions for pool, run, and riffle habitats to accurately use the MSHA methodology.
3. Description: The presence and abundance of stream fishes are strongly related to the physical and chemical characteristics of a stream. With changes in stream size, nutrients, and habitat, shifts in fish community structure and function may occur. Physical habitat in streams has been measured and quantified by various methods, including Habitat Suitability Indices (HSIs), Habitat Quality Index, and Index of Biotic Integrity. These methods can be time-consuming and costly. To address this issue, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency developed the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI) methodology to provide a measure of macro-habitat quality that corresponds to physical factors affecting fish communities and other aquatic life such as invertebrates. The QHEI is composed of an array of metrics describing attributes of physical habitat that may be important in explaining species presence, absence, and composition of fish communities in a stream, without employing the more labor-intensive methods of various HSIs developed for specific fish species.
The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) has developed a stream habitat assessment worksheet derived from the Ohio QHEI methodology, known as the Minnesota Stream Habitat Assessment (MSHA). A comparison of the two assessments indicates a strong similarity; however, the MSHA methodology is believed to be a better reflection of important factors influencing Minnesota streams. The text highlights the adoption of the MSHA methodology by DNR Fisheries, which will facilitate exchange of data between agencies.
Standardized definitions for pool, run, and riffle habitats are essential for accurately using the MSHA methodology. Refer to the definitions for various channel types in step-by-step instructions provided elsewhere.
4. Target: The primary focus of this text is to explain the adoption of the Minnesota Stream Habitat Assessment (MSHA) methodology by DNR Fisheries as a stream habitat evaluation method that accurately reflects important factors influencing Minnesota streams.
5. Constraints: Standardized definitions for pool, run, and riffle habitats are essential for accurately using the MSHA methodology, indicating potential difficulties in defining these terms consistently across different contexts and locations.
